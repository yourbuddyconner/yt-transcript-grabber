 Not even - * laughs * 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.620
 Okay! I must find the original. 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.460
 It's like you're in a pool with an egg here ... 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.300
 (Music: Low from Flo Rida can be heard) 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.920
 Wait, is it real? 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:06.420
 Wait, is it real? * Chuckle (seems unconfirmed) * 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.660
 Where is the origin? I try-, because it's in a swimming pool. 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.340
 Jacuzzi or something. Okay. Not real it just - inaudible because it started the video * 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.800
 * Song * 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.200
 * Poods / Singing * Now the whole club is seen ... 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.680
 * Do not sing, talk * Nothing like a good old Jacuzzi bath with your AK gun. 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.020
 * Star laughing and loud * Ha, looks very stupid! 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.780
 * Real laughter * 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.280
 Oh my god, on making video, making video on my son, my son. 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.180
 * Say something inaudible * 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:55.240
 * Hold music and soft music * 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.760

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.000
 👏👏👏 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.860
 I really like to see some sort of Mim coin. 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.620
 If anyone can invent a M coin when any new M is published 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.140
 It's like stocks, right? You can invest in Mim stock. This, I know this idea is a billion dollars. 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.760
 Because this is a rebellious bar. It's like an old bar back 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.860

 God damn it! Do you enjoy watching this empty face, and then from time to time come out of ha ha? 

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.620
 I hope you will enjoy as much as I enjoy. 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:19.560

 I would like to see Mim like him 

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:25.940
 Just random animations that claim to be their mimes of the future, because literally anything is just a mime these days. 

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:32.129
 You can not - you can not define something like this "No, this is ridiculous can not be good". Literally anything can be a bar. 

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.340
 It is the beauty point of the youth.
