00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.560
 Do you like to retreat, young people? 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.060
 I love to retreat. 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.640
 In case you do not notice that I am a kind of retreating man. 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:06.820
 Put me in any 

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.760
 Realistic scenario, 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.040
 I just will not know how to deal with it. 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.540
 A clip of a professional handshake with the play of Conan. 

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:19.200
 It was terrible. The handshake was high up and then down 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.960
 I did not want to do it again. 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.880
 Hihihihi 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.260
 But this is what makes me more submissive, 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.160
 Because I understand submissiveness. 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.340
 I explain the decline. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.460
 So without further ado, let's go to some of my favorite retreats 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.920
 The TV version is fun 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.660
 👏👏👏👏👏👏 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:44.200
 You really are tossing the barrel now, Felix, I'm deaf .... I love this because it's basically how all my introductions are 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.640
 Haha ha ha ha ha 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.440
 Hello and welcome, thank you, I never felt welcome to you this how natural it was 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.860
 It became very chaotic and panic-stricken 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.620
 Welcome and welcome to this section 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.440
 I hope you guys are looking for .. Hehihihi I do not know what is the problem of retreating on television 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.040
 It's just funny because it's like organic subservience 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.940
 Do you know what I mean? I mean when this thing happened with Conan, you know, I know you see what I'm thinking. I'm planning for that 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.140
 I'm like you .. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's happening. Yes, I trust the editorial system that they will not pay attention to it 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.020
 They will cut it. No, that's why we know it's good to have these beautiful moments 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.300
 Well, this is here .. It's Fatai 👏 ..Marjali 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.149
 👏 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:51.119
 Timeout 30 seconds on Richard Stadium You are on direct TV 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.869
 You must give us 30 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.309
 Again as a video I watched this section to get out in the morning so I can start my day and I can 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.719
 The activity and get a great big catalytic boost just watch the man Richard does. Well, Richard, you can start to prefer 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.679
 Come on, Richard, do it 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:12.509
 Hello, Are you looking for someone who has more than? 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.500
 From 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.500
 Just focus on 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.640
 Technique 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.640
 You are looking for someone 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.380
 Who has the 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.380
 No 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.980
 Oh no 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.940
 Well, go tell us talking to me as if we were talking at dinner table Come on Richard 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.950
 what do you have? What can you offer? 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.750
 Come on Richard, please. Well reset again for a second. there is no problem. Well, come on again. And 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.980
 Here is when all hope is lost 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:59.340
 When the modified Frodo craves. When the Titanic sinks when that plane becomes, no, when all hope is lost 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:07.380
 Richard the best 10 animations turned over the old time killed .. He returned and sat and killed by 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.220
 1000% Well 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.940
 I was looking for someone more than just an intelligent technology 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.240
 Someone who has a customer focus and 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.080
 He has an international experience and is a person who solves problems 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:31.180
 And my analytical so far has common sense. Yes really. I am this person. I have something great 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:33.280
 Customer 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.460
 Concentrated skills and wonderful skills. I 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:39.740
 I have a facility to take 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:42.509
 Comprehensive ownership of the project 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.320
 And design to do whatever it takes to accomplish the task 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:50.820
 Wonderful, Richard, this is a very terrible section 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.040
 Very happy for what happened to him, man 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.850
 Richard is not submissive .. I just love the section 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:04.080
 You know they say in the relationship what they do not do in public places they do at home. It's a bit more specific though 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.900
 Hihihi 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.380
 Great words Felix. I know ... while this passage is testimony to that and divine 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.440
 It's probably one of the most painful battles I've ever seen on television 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.920
 Thanks Mr. The President, thank you. Good morning to everyone and welcome to Joe's morning and Joe is back 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.700
 Is not it nice to come back? 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:30.360
 - We did a lot of battles around the issues. So it should be a good offer to know. - Oh no, oh, yes, we do not fight 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.360
 No no do not do this 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.680
 Oh, this is not. Here's not what you're doing, it's six and three minutes in the morning 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.400
 Well, I can ask you a question 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.369
 Everyone knows that you can not hold her hand at 6:03 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:50.740
 Well, you can not do any gesture of love at 6:03 touching your hands might also give it a slap on 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.180
 Her nose 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.920
 I do not know 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:58.560
 We are linked, I mean, that we have been linked for 13 hours 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.080
 I love you 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.160
 Do you think I can hold her hands? 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.500
 No .. not in the hour 

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:08.740
 6:03 Not at 6:03 Everyone knows this can you calm down. I'll hold your hand 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.830
 Oh my God, but there is a chance to love in the morning after the heat reaches 8 to 13 degrees super 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.969
 So choose the first day of last month. Oh God, I am 

00:05:21.969 --> 00:05:23.570
 Hahaha 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:28.680
 Said this and I said before all else do not kiss me, I mean, what is the benefit? 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:36.700
 Do not accept someone who is not your fiance or your girlfriend's husband on camera at all. Just do not do that. Just do not do that 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.670
 Just do not do that. Okay. Just do not accept people just do not kiss anyone just do not want to kiss this guy 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:44.240
 It was like knowing what? 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:48.800
 To break this rule I will send $ # 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.660
 You have one job 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.420
 Well, you know how much shame you have to offer in order to shake hands. What do you think? 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.800
 If I go for kissing, huh? What do you think is happening? 

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.760
 Hihihihi 

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:13.800
 Well, this video is awesome where it uh you are here 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.400
 Hahihihaihaaha 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:23.360
 I will only occupy it just a quarter of an hour. Yes, his phone rings and what does he do? 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.760
 * Throwing Phone * 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.180
 You love that 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:35.829
 Yes, this is less surprising you can only wipe it so you should not throw the phone away Yal Christ 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:37.940
 I love the sound 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:39.940
 But 

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.400
 You love that 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:53.859
 Enjoy your broken phone and your last job. Oh this is this one great man Mike craftsman 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.780
 Speaks basically as I do 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:58.570
 When it is not contagious 

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.719
 If you want to know how the unedited videos appear 

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.020
 It's basically such people trying to overcome the heat and try to stay calm and tomorrow 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.440
 And people 

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.070
 This is you guys hope the video will be fun and 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.080
 Tomorrow 

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:30.730
 Do not misunderstand me wrong. I do not kill these people really I just celebrated it. We are a group of retreating 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:37.440
 We all know how it feels that I like this section because all you say is just cursed 

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:44.120
 Boring and this girl is copying in the background and only aware that 

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:46.860
 For the lottery that starts tomorrow 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.140
 Open until Friday you will know UAA 

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:57.980
 Can I swap my cell phone with this? Picked from Tuesday to Thursday are now students who 

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:59.980
 Oh well I can not see her now 

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.980
 Where did you go 

00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:06.340
 Everyone is welcome to subscribe directly from the newsroom Kara Minelli. Of WUFT News 

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:11.020
 It's like what's going on? I will be beautiful where will I be without you? 

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.140
 I am very pale 

00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:21.220
 Today's snow 

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.260
 Very low, one to three inches of 

00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:25.509
 Snowfall in Seattle and other areas 

00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:28.149
 This is the kind of thing you know 

00:08:28.150 --> 00:08:32.650
 I'll do it if I do this on the camera Brad and Brad 2 - will draw attention to it 

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:37.719
 So now if you make a mistake at any time in the foreground you usually know how to continue doing it and re-doing it 

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.360
 Instead, I have to stop recording and start over 

00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.560
 Because of these trenches 

00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:45.700
 These meanings 

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:50.020
 * He watches some things that get angry I'm serious * 

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:55.680
 This section is very strange, okay. If no one has a context behind this, please feel free to let us know 

00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.320
 I do not know. What is its damned problem? I feel it. Look at her 

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.220
 what are you doing 

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.180
 I love to invite you Abe thank you. I can love it just what happened 

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:12.539
 What happened there? They are communicating 

00:09:12.839 --> 00:09:15.839
 It's not about the record this morning, but frankly, I feel like it's broken 

00:09:15.839 --> 00:09:18.209
 This is like the best song I play that song 

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.050
 I love to call you my father. Thank you 

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.520
 Anyway, this is the best song ever. I really enjoy it. I've got it, Dad 

00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:33.020
 I love your calls to dad so his answer is so wonderful. It's not like it's strange. no she 

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.420
 Like oh .. thank you 

00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:41.060
 I love to kiss you 

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.320
 They should work on the BBC 

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000
 No 

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:57.240
 No, no, no, no not in a hidden place, this passage is 

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:58.660
 Too 

00:09:58.660 --> 00:10:00.400
 Painful, I 

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:06.960
 You need a nuclear warning on this. This is not clear. Oh God, Christ. Well guys. are you ready? 

00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:12.500
 I'm going to press run three two one .. do we get the picture for you and then it will be posted everywhere? 

00:10:12.500 --> 00:10:17.680
 You will also be in your office. Yes, you may not think so 

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:21.480
 Well, that depends, you know, I have some time in the camera. Why not stop? 

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.410
 No, well, mother, oh 

00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:31.460
 What is the problem of people, you know that people are talking about 

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:37.000
 Social issues like I do not happen and you see you see the news and it's there 

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:43.160
 It's hidden in the sight of everyone probably because I did not have an office job. Maybe this is the problem why say so? 

00:10:43.170 --> 00:10:45.990
 You know, I have some time and a camera. Why not stop? 

00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:52.409
 No, well, that's in the context of what some people think it is 

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:58.680
 Of bare pictures and he falls into the strangest problem ever. Camera with me! 

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.840
 I lost the connection ... some time from the camera. Why not stop? 

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:04.800
 Yes, I'll stop. what a hell 

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:10.100
 What do you think? Oh it is not as bad as the kiss .. This was a joke 

00:11:10.220 --> 00:11:15.000
 Oh really ? We move to the weather .. I think you should stay home 

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.060
 Heehihihai 

00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:21.060
 Yes, I like this section 

00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:26.300
 Right. I have seen them all. I just show it to you because I love it. Okay 

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.460
 This man says a joke is a strange fanaticism and no one laughs 

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:33.120
 This makes it much worse 

00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:35.720
 Oh my god, doctor 

00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:40.340
 Well Charlie, I'll just hang out with our new friend here, "Pittina" 

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:43.480
 Oh really ? Go back to the weather oh yeah 

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.600
 I think you should stay at home 

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:51.200
 Or a room in the hotel or something a lot of events are going on here, oh Charlie 

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:53.400
 Probably most work 

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:57.480
 HAH 

00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:00.900
 Let's look at the heat, oh my god 

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:09.240
 Oh, I've locked myself this time and I do not want to beat anyone else 69 degrees in ... 

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:14.520
 Oh, oh, ahhhhhhhh oh yeah this is one of the best events that may ever occur 

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:20.540
 Horrible joke Why and continue to work, my God I think these jokes are bad? 

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:24.780
 Shisha Shish. Uh, I need a minute I need a break 

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:32.100
 We have here Fatai. I can not even watch this. This will do the spoken words now and 

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:34.000
 Tell us what we are going to hear 

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:40.200
 Just a free art. It's just weird, you know every style I feel having humor there by the way, okay 

00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:50.900
 🎵 Years ago, they tried it years ago. Just try to put me in it 

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.220
 🎵 Check this out .. See this for 

00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:00.070
