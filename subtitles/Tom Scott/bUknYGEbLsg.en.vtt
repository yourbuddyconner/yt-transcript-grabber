00:00:00.239 --> 00:00:04.049
 This is John Nese and this is a lemonade shop. 

00:00:04.129 --> 00:00:08.448
 This is Galco's Soda Pop Stop. We have about 700 kinds of sodas here. 

00:00:08.608 --> 00:00:10.887
 We also have 700 different kinds of beer. 

00:00:11.053 --> 00:00:14.799
 We have everything you look for in vain, and even that, 

00:00:15.134 --> 00:00:18.609
 what do you look at and say, "I did not even know they were making it." 

00:00:18.752 --> 00:00:20.920
 This is cucumber soda. 

00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:27.423
 This has begun to be produced here and in 2010 it has become the soda of the year. 

00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:28.838
 It's great. 

00:00:28.998 --> 00:00:33.063
 This is Ouzon. 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.362
 It's soda with licorice flavor. 

00:00:36.434 --> 00:00:40.499
 I do not like licorice, but I tasted it and it was great. 

00:00:40.627 --> 00:00:42.986
 We were an Italian grocery store. 

00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:45.297
 The neighborhood has begun to change 

00:00:45.377 --> 00:00:51.776
 and at about that time supermarkets bought distribution channels for small stores 

00:00:51.919 --> 00:00:53.130
 and they closed them. 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.091
 They destroyed our livelihood. 

00:00:55.394 --> 00:00:57.673
 Their ways were not really nice. 

00:00:57.802 --> 00:00:59.702
 I began to think about it and said, 

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:04.222
 "You know what? You should be glad that your shelves did not buy Pepsi 

00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:06.505
 and that you can sell anything at will. " 

00:01:06.783 --> 00:01:10.698
 So I discovered 25 smaller brands of sodas 

00:01:10.851 --> 00:01:12.164
 and placed them in racks. 

00:01:12.227 --> 00:01:16.946
 We have found out that small outlets still exist out there. 

00:01:17.313 --> 00:01:21.113
 They use glass bottles, real ingredients, cane sugar ... 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.659
 What more could people want? 

00:01:24.029 --> 00:01:26.082
 Did you say cane sugar? 

00:01:26.213 --> 00:01:30.714
 Do you want to hear about the US and their corn syrup? 

00:01:30.823 --> 00:01:31.971
 Carefully! 

00:01:32.048 --> 00:01:36.881
 When you go to a supermarket and eat frozen food or sweets ... 

00:01:36.993 --> 00:01:41.265
 It does not matter what you eat ... Even in corn syrup. 

00:01:41.647 --> 00:01:44.109
 It was not 25 years ago. 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.233
 Everything is now corn syrup. Why? 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.380
 This is the first soda in the bottle. 

00:01:49.443 --> 00:01:54.364
 It was sold as a tonic to calm down the stomach. 

00:01:54.496 --> 00:01:59.750
 If you drink it quickly, it will look like a carbonated cough syrup. 

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:04.838
 But when you sip it, you will feel the wheel, root beer, cinnamon, vanilla 

00:02:04.965 --> 00:02:06.394
 licorice or even cherries. 

00:02:06.496 --> 00:02:09.212
 There are 4 to 5 flavors in one bottle. 

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.978
 These come from Georgia. 

00:02:11.073 --> 00:02:14.682
 They produce it from naturally carbonated water. 

00:02:14.803 --> 00:02:18.399
 It does not catch it artificially, it flows out of the ground. 

00:02:18.608 --> 00:02:23.569
 After I finished, I decided I wanted to trade. 

00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:27.620
 My father told me to go for a big company. 

00:02:27.781 --> 00:02:31.356
 But I told him I wanted to work here because every day is different. 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.257
 He shook his head and said, 

00:02:33.435 --> 00:02:36.585
 "You will hardly earn the rent. 

00:02:36.884 --> 00:02:41.258
 You are a fool. Go for a big company and get paid. " 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.506
 And I: "I do not want that." 

00:02:44.755 --> 00:02:47.185
 That was important. So it's important. 

00:02:47.274 --> 00:02:49.073
 What you are doing, you have to be happy. 

00:02:49.187 --> 00:02:52.401
 If you do not like it, it's wrong. 

00:02:52.724 --> 00:02:56.027
 Thank you to John Nes and to the staff of the Soda Pop Stop. 

00:02:56.154 --> 00:03:00.184
 You can find them on York Boulevard in Higland Park, Los Angeles. 

00:03:00.293 --> 00:03:03.749
 I apologize for the shaky camera, I had only GoPro with me. 

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:08.144
 But I could not forgive my visit to such a thing.
