00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
 "# 1: USE POLITICAL SOURCE TO PROVIDE VOTERS." 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.840
 We were left six weeks before the General Elections in the UK, which means we are in "purdah" ("curtain"). 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.730
 Unless it is absolutely critical, people in leadership, whether national or local, 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.850
 are not allowed to announce any new law, 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:16.619
 sign large new contracts, or do something official 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.269
 which can be seen as an attempt to use their power to unduly influence the election. 

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.480
 It is not that much will do something: the Parliament was already scattered, 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.260
 that they all go out and campaign. By the way... 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.800
 "# 2: SAVE MUCH MONEY." 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.750
 The rules are complicated and depend on the size of the area where you are campaigning, 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.210
 but from now on until the election day, every individual candidate can spend no more 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:43.289
 than about £ 15,000 (~ 17,000 €, 2 million Lek) throughout their campaign. There is nothing to talk about: 

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.530
 this is in everything. Each penny must be numbered, traced and billed, 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.129
 and if it exceeds, you may be disqualified even after the elections. 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.109
 And all the tricks and tricks you are thinking of to pass around it? 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:59.429
 The law covers most of them with a comprehensive clause saying that a "sincere assessment" should be made. 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.100
 Political parties also have a limit on their national campaign budget, 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.660
 which is about 20 million pounds (22 million euros, 3 billion leke) over the entire country. 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.490
 Sounds like much, but as a comparison: The recent US elections cost $ 6 billion ($ 5.07 billion, £ 680 trillion). 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.460
 But sticking to this is not as difficult as you think, because ... 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.240
 "# 3: ADVERTISING ON TELEVISION." 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.090
 The United Kingdom has never allowed political advertising on television. 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.090
 The parties are given a small amount of free time in large channels, 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.540
 but almost everyone stops hearing the phrase, 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.700
 "Now, an Election Spot sponsored by ..." 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.980
 This year, however, the parties realized that they could put online attack advertisements instead, 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.600
 and then use their limited budget to direct these ads only to people 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.440
 living in marginal areas - the seas, for Americans there. 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.110
 If you live in one of them, you may have seen one of these ads before this video. 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.549
 So okay, the parties can not advertise on television, 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.000
 but they certainly got the experts in the news arguing for them, right? 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.820
 "# 4: LEARNING SUBJECT TO TELEVISION." 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:02.439
 News on television should be - yes, just right and balanced. By law. 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.649
 In general, the BBC receives an equal amount of complaints from all sides, 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.869
 and then they think that they have done their job more or less well. 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.150
 However, newspapers have no such limitations, 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.640
 and the tabloids have been quite happy to use that influence in the past. 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.340
 "# 5: CREAMING HUMANS." 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.830
 I swear it's so called. This is how it works: 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.040
 go to a retirement home, and by self-confidence, bribery, or threat, 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.650
 receives access to or by mail of the residents, 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.220
 or rename them as their intercessor voter, to vote under their own name. 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.540
 Surprisingly, this has only been illegal since 2006. 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.400
 "# 6: TAKE THE RESULT." 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.540
 How do I break a score? Well, mail votes are sometimes opened for verification 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:47.290
 with days before polls are closed. No reason why not, this will not change the result 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.670
 as long as they remain secret. And no one does anything crazy like, 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.640
 oh I do not know, to post what she has seen. Bravo there, current member of Parliament. 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.159
 She wiped it off as soon as possible, accepted it, and was given a formal warning by the police. 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.900
 And finally: 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.340
 "# 7: DO NOT MAKE POSTERS AFTER CAMPAIGN." 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.560
 Anyone who has put up the posters or puts some temporary signs in their garden: 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:10.700
 they should be sure to be removed within two weeks. 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.080
 If it looks like the last time, we may not even have a government there by then, 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.409
 but at least those of us who live far from Westminster will not be constantly reminded. 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.360
