00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.760
 Best YouTube Player 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:15.660
 I have more subscribers 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.860
 Which means I have more skills 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.820
 . This game is a bit difficult 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.820
 It's just like (Dark Souls) 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.140
 I asked you to challenge me seriously 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.500
 Give me a real game 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.040
 They gave me a real challenge 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:39.720
 Hey Bodipay, you must play "I want to be a man" It's a very difficult game, just like (DarkSouls) 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.400
 Oh My God 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.820
 I want to be a man movie: game 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.940
 If you jump by "Shift", what are these settings of the hell control 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.620
 I must be able to shoot if. Well, I appreciate 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.840
 Okay 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.120
 well, okay. "This game is difficult as they say" 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.520
 AAAAAAAMMM 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.940
 It does not matter, zero times death, to do this again. 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.700
 Well, here we are 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.180
 "This game is very difficult" 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.760
 See how tough the game was 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.280
 Trap is easy - anyone can understand this nonsense 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:27.960
 Stay away from me, O dreaded trap. 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.860
 Well, next level 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.020
 Zero times death 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.160
 This is the easiest game in my life. I just have to stand here. 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.960
 Oh Wow. This is very difficult (ironically) 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.860
 This, almost, is absolutely impossible 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.560
 Well, I wonder what you will do next 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.120
 Well, run 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.820
 Oh Wow. Ooooh 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:01.080
 What was the right of that marriage? Shut up, what's this? 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.480
 How the hell can I do that? 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.200
 I touched that nipple of mine 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.060
 I liked. Do it again, please. come back! I love you. 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.920
 I love you, please stay with me I want to-- 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.000
 You have sinned me, O uncle. 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.640
 This is not difficult, 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.360
 This is a collection of patterns that children play 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.200
 Anyone can succeed by, anyone. 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.340
 Give me a challenge that requires skills 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.700
 Of these magic fingers, well, give it to me 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.760
 Screw you 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.640
 What the hell am I doing? 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.160
 He hits me anyway. what should I do 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.020
 Oh my God, this is very boring 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.000
 I have to wait for this nonsense every time. 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:01.180
 Uh, wait. I can not swear because I will not make money from the video that I did. I mean no, this-- 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:03.460
 go Go 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.940
 Skip there, do not jump! you idiot ! 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.300
 Did not jump, what is the right to marry you? 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.560
 Understand, now, understand 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.640
 I knew it before I ever started 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.160
 I just wanted to pretend that I was bad so that you would not feel bad about yourselves. 

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.840
 Just to feel, oh, it can not be that brilliance 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.000
 I am proficient 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.280
 Well, watch this 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.860
 First time playing this game 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.160
 I bet you had to watch lessons to play this game. 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.820
 Oh, Wow. I won in Dark Souls the third time I played 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.760
 Really, have you seen people play it on YouTube? Because that does not count 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.980
 You did not jump 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.080
 Wait, can he jump twice? 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.880
 Yes I understand. You can play with easy mode. 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.480
 There is nothing wrong 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.680
 There is nothing wrong, because I am the man 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.380
 Double jump 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.340
 Well see this 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.660
 Why not come now 

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.440
 How are you supposed to cut all the distance 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.860
 How do?! 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.860
 This game is very stupid 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.700
 My God 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.140
 I love to be sure, this is aggressive 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:22.660
 All other games you do not have to think about 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:24.340
 They did not play Zelda before they got up 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.840
 My God, this is my enemy 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.980
 Go, Go, Go, Go, Go, Go, Go, 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.960
 hit me 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.920
 How do I go there? 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.320
 How do I go there? 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.000
 I walk down, jump 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.080
 What happened to the double jump? 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.640
 Do you think that I was walking down? 

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:48.840
 stupidity 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.600
 This game is silly, silly game, silly 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.160
 I mean it 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.240
 Do not touch the surface almost 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.240
 I mean this 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.600
 The thing. Understand it. Understand it now! Understand it now! 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.160
 Look at me, look at me 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.600
 Well, look 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.080
 Let me back down 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.280
 This is the first phase 

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.180
 I'm free to walk here but just to get to a certain point 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.360
 The thing works 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.860
 There 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.040
 But how do you really love the-- 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.480
 How are you supposed to jump those jump? 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.800
 How do? How supposed 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:37.240
 To jump 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.400
 Skip 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.960
 How can this be physically possible 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:48.580
 There must be a way 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.880
 Thus, these things are built in the Caliphate, there must be a way of using them 

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:54.440
 There is a secret to them 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.160
 Learn, understand, understand before you understand it 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:02.240
 Let's start 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:05.500
 Understand, understand, okay? I do not want you to tell me 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.920
 Oh biodepay all you have to do, it's very clear 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:10.640
 It's very clear, Bodhi 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:16.360
 no no no 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:17.840
 Watch it 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:22.240
 genius 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.760
 Very clever, did you see that nonsense 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:27.360
 I have defeated the game 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.340
 The game was also defeated, it was easy 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:35.440
 Well Well 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:39.055
 Can we continue now? Easy! This game is easy 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.040
 We have not reached the place of preservation yet 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:43.520
 There will be a trap near the place of preservation 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:46.020
 Not at the time of my observation 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:49.520
 I got it. I got it. 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.280
 This screw fell off 

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:54.940
 what is this? We'll go up 

00:06:55.620 --> 00:07:00.120
 Wow, oh, will the apples attack me? 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:06.360
 Oh, wow, let me think, will the water make me survive? 

00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.300
 Do not die in water, good 

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:13.020
 Now what I have to do 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:22.980
 Biody resentment 

00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:27.980
 It is better not to have two apples in the nail 

00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.860
 If there are two arguments in this screw 

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.160
 This guy will not be happy 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:34.600
 You are bad 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.320
 Well, we knew 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.500
 And the most important 

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.200
 Well, these apples can not be trusted 

00:07:42.460 --> 00:07:44.220
 They will extrude vertically 

00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.900
 Oh, yeah, that's right 

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.020
 I will call you 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.800
 Well, you can not shoot on the apples 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.320
 but it's okay 

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.200
 Damn Lamk 

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.940
 When the apples kill everything 

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:57.640
 Shut up, apples 

00:07:58.200 --> 00:07:59.580
 Dess, what did you just say? 

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:02.720
 Has anyone ever died before an apple? 

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.840
 I have to influence these apples 

00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:11.740
 This game depends on the effect on the apples 

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:16.960
 See for him wonderful skills 

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.720
 Well, Anzer, oh, Wow apples 

00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.220
 I see a step forward 

00:08:21.400 --> 00:08:22.740
 I thought they would shoot vertically 

00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.080
 But they did not shoot 

00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:27.040
 Oh, my God, I do not trust this apple for a second 

00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:30.220
 Wonderful 

00:08:30.940 --> 00:08:33.700
 Just what I wanted 

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:36.220
 Well, let's take it easy 

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:40.060
 Take it easy, thank you, we can do it 

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.380
 To silence, you have to affect all the apples 

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:53.420
 And will not come after 

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.420
 Old trick, my grandfather told me 

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.700
 Hey, if you do not come, touch all the apples 

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.240
 I know you're saying, "Oh Biodepi is giving up now 

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.460
 He can not do it, I can do whatever I want 

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.000
 AAA, you can not jump this jump 

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:21.920
 Not today, you comet, well, you're fine, you comet, you won this tour 

00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.780
 AAA, the game is tough because you have to consider how it works 

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.860
 You searched for it online 

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.680
 But it's okay because I'm good enough 

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:35.820
 Come, comet, come on, comet, come on, you comet 

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.520
 Do not want to live forever 

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.140
 Guilty of eye 

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:48.240
 Well, we must affect these apples as much as possible 

00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.280
 Not today, not today, O apples, not today 

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.780
 Because I am an expert on apples 

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:02.680
 Oooh the culprit, Oooh the culprit, Oooh, Oooh, no, no, this is not you sinner 

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:06.500
 They follow you, are you kidding me? , what the hell ? 

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:08.520
 Not today, lady apple 

00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:11.400
 I will affect these too, I do not have time 

00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:19.160
 Oh my God, well, here it is, Mr. Comet, please 

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.120
 Oh no 

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:23.780
 No, no 

00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:26.380
 Noga (not in Swedish) 

00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.860
 I love you 

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.060
 Oahu Jesses 

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.600
 Noga (not in Swedish) 

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:04.960
 AAA, I was about to survive, zero dead Owah 

00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:12.740
 Come on, come on, come on, come on, Oooh, Owoh 

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:14.900
 This game is very difficult 

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:20.840
 It continues in my appendices, it continues in my appendices, 

00:11:21.300 --> 00:11:22.540
 For 

00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:26.680
 why are you doing this ?? Why 

00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:35.980
 Stay away from me, just stay here, you can not touch here Ooh, ohhaha 

00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:37.560
 And finally 

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:41.340
 Goodbye, oh, oh, ohh no 

00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:46.400
 Can not you change the __? 

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:50.200
 leave me alone 

00:11:50.220 --> 00:11:52.020
 leave me alone 

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.340
 Good-bye 

00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:00.960
 Well, well, let's take it gently and easily, I can shoot 

00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:03.720
 Can I jump to the link 

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:13.360
 I can jump here, okay, I'm safe, my God, okay, okay? , Let 's go .... OWAH: O 

00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:19.020
 Save, silence on your sword, Sheikh, thank you 

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.700
