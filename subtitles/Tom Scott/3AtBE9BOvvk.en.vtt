00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.400
 This is my true emoji keyboard. 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:06.539
 14 common keyboards attached here to the laptop, 

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:09.559
 over 1000 individual labels, 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:12.980
 and special software to each of these buttons 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.200
 wrote another symbol. 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.080
 And there's every emoj you'll remember, or at least so far. 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.590
 So when you want smileys: Right here in front of you. 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.210
 Animals and plants are here with food. 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.060
 Which is actually the same thing. 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.410
 Here's the right. All symbols, sport and time here 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:37.390
 And here, on the right, we have the flags of all countries and a few unclassified symbols. 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.340
 So if you want to add a kiss to your tweet, it's here. 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.070
 Month of the month for your professional work. He's here. 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.680
 Simplified month moon for less professional work. No problem right here. 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.449
 Black Santa? I have what you need. 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.010
 Push Santa, then Type 6 skin modifier here 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.769
 Bum. Black Santa. Here you have it. 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:04.040
 There is literally and in the letter of every emoji, even those that still do not work on any mobile or computer. 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.660
 Do you want a levitating man in a suit? Here's the button. 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.890
 So far it does not work, but once this tweet is displayed on iOS 9.1, 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:13.930
 when it comes out? 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.110
 It will emulate a man in a suit that levitates. 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.820
 You want someone to send a "bird". Here. 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.780
 And a real bird? There's a dozen of them here. 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.220
 Penguins, pigeons, little chickens in an egg or outside. It is up to you. 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.930
 Bikini, kimono, eggplant, of course. 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.320
 If you want to make sure your message is only for over 18 years. Done. 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.280
 Do you want to ban the disposal of garbage? This keyboard is for you. 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.360
 Do you want to ban waste disposal in Belgium? Soon? I have what you are looking for. 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.250
 Forget all the touch screens on your smartphone: 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:59.250
 If you want to have all the emoji at your fingertips, literally: This is the keyboard for you. 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.710
 To know how I made this keyboard: 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.970
 I have a much longer video on how exactly 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:06.720
 as I did. 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.440
 But yes. I put the emoji keypad. It's kind of ridiculous. 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.440
