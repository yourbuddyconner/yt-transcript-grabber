00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.589
 Welcome to Oversight. You are now part of the front line that protects our country from before 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.100
 terrorists, predators, illegal immigrants and livers. Thank you for your cooperation. 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.400
 Oversight is contractually committed to running its automated filter for the government. 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.360
 The filter tracks every bit of Internet traffic that goes through Britain. If he finds something 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.010
 the suspect will be handed over to you or to one of the thousands of other volunteers. 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.640
 When you log in to the system, you will see a list of potential incidents. 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.780
 Click any one to start the investigation. 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.000
 Is this a humorous email between friends, or a serious incident to notify the police? 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.030
 You have tools to find out. You can read e-mail items; 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.100
 web sites they visited; information from social networks; the places they visited; 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.359
 card purchases; and information about their friends and family. 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:51.329
 If you need access to more personal information, such as the content of their emails and documents, 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.609
 or the individual websites they read, you can request a search permission by clicking: 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:01:00.800
 this will normally be provided within 15 to 30 seconds. In many cases, it is not necessary: 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.200
 34% of British adults have signed up for our Clearway program, which gives you instant access 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.980
 helping to prevent crime. 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.900
 If you find it difficult to investigate someone, do not waste your time: immediately hand over to your supervisor. 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.780
 We find that deliberate hiding of own tracks is usually a sign of criminal activity. 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.100
 Thanks to our cooperation with sister companies around the world, you have now 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.310
 information on citizens from more than 70 countries. 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.580
 If you use another language, you may sometimes be assigned to jurisdictions outside the United Kingdom. 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.980
 Legal and social restrictions in other countries may be different from your own country: be impartial, 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.550
 and follow the on-screen instructions. 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.910
 And finally: Do not tell your friends that you are part of our team. Our filter systems 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.480
 are effective because they are universal: there really is no way to avoid them, 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.620
 and you can never know who could be a member of Oversight ... including the person you boast about. 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.140
 So thank you once again for your cooperation. With your help, we can keep ourselves, 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.610
 our children, and our world safe. 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.060
