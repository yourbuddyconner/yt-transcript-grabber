00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:02.380
 Oh hi there! 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.460
 Do not care about me, I just walk in the forest 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.900
 Or do I actually? 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.230
 That's true 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.200
 I'm in space 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.200
 Or am I actually? 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:17.880
 That's true 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.080
 I'm in the woods again 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.100
 I can tell that you have 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:27.680
 Strong thinking 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.040
 This video is not for the weak minds (superficial) 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:34.440
 This video will make you think 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.640
 How to make your eyes real, if you do not have eyes 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.140
 Today we will go to the Reddit site where the place goes to the owners of deep thinking 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.220
 Socrates, Plato, if they revive this place where they will spend their time and spread their judgment in it 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.800
 I definitely speak about I am 14. This is a deep riddet. Is your mind ready? 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.340
 To explode 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:00.540
 Let's Begin 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.960
 A coincidence or not 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.920
 If the letters are equal to the numbers, well, then 11 + 14 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.760
 * Knowledge is equal to 96%, but hard work is equal 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.440
 98% are both important, but both have not received 100% 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.680
 Behavior equals 100% 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.380
 *shock* 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.600
 Okay! This will actually make you think 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.380
 By coincidence or not? We will never know 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.560
 But at least we learned, and the sex of the ass is 110%, in fact 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.040
 Equal to 111% 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:40.560
 After you !!!! 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.020
 This strongly influenced Vinny 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.580
 Instagram 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.000
 LOL 

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:49.260
 That's right, so I do not have an instagram 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.820
 Thank you very much all these sheep 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.680
 These sheep, these fools easily fall by the devil 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.479
 In the instagram 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.660
 Timbler became realistic, guys, okay 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.640
 It's a bulb and a mousetrap "This image has a deep meaning, bulb 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:10.360
 The idea of ​​a person represents either a rat trap that represents how fast it is 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.860
 The community runs this idea "... are you lagging behind? 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.400
 Not just a bulb falling on a rat trap, close your mouth 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.150
 Young I do not know the significance of the picture 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.580
 But if that is what the person said, he proved it correctly, she said 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.540
 You control it, like what you said about society 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.740
 His forehead was pounded 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.900
 What I am astonished by this is I, just the smart ones will understand 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.800
 هههههههههههههههه 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.640
 That's right, you have to 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.740
 This is a great mind 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.220
 To possess this heterogeneous mind. See all your happy people, but I'm very clever 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:00.700
 To be happy. I once saw a lot of Rick and Morty episodes and then I knew I was done 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:08.300
 Then I learned depression is real ... after me! Parallel lines have many common factors but they never meet 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:11.380
 Start ! Do you think this is sad? 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:18.279
 But cross-lines meet once and then never meet! This is really sad. 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:19.900
 very 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.460
 Crisis, turnover, regression, pressure, overcrowding 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.400
 There is nothing Vinnie influenced more than the cross-lines 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.640
 This is too deep! 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.320
 I have not thought about the lines before 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.660
 View Profile 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.000
 This deep heheheh 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.080
 I do not know what's going to happen but I'll only cry when I think that ****** they think they look like Danny Davito 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:52.620
 Hey man, I 'il be very happy if you see Danny Devito when you really see the mirror 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.730
 I will be happy, why do I put headphones? If there is no sound! 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.380
 * Great exclamation marks question * - Freemasonry everywhere 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:06.620
 I have iPhone, Mac 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.880
 Xbox, Playstation 3, Wii 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.900
 Internet, money portfolio, more than most families, I'm never happy 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.580
 Using a stone as a camera, the happiest child in the world! 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.800
 I wish I had a stone, some kids are really lucky 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.280
 I wish I had a religion, some kids are lucky 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.440
 I wish I had kids, hands really lucky. 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.140
 My God it lasts, this is actually sad! (Breast) 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.900
 Book 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.760
 Second time if you see a breast 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.920
 I will read the book ten times to make up. Not 20 times. For every breast of his breasts 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.720
 200 books. Only one breast Haha 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.359
 If the Titanic sank in 2017 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.760
 All of the people were shooting, "What is supposed to be my destiny, save the ship, for example?" 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:08.680
 But at least if we unite with some of the wives of Hashtak # save_taitenk_2017 lie in peace 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.460
 I'm fine (from above look saved) 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:20.620
 If there was only one person at least, he would have been saved. Shufu how the fingers of her feet 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:23.989
 How perfectly she was walking from her knees 

00:05:23.989 --> 00:05:28.360
 It was the fingers of her legs growing from her knees, this is disgusting 

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.840
 Why do you clean a vacuum cleaner? 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.660
 Sorry, because you clean the vacuum cleaner you are considering 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.960
 Vacuum cleaner. Your age I thought, do you forget? I did not think I was scared! 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.100
 *Laughter* 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:42.240
 * Inspiration * Hmm .. Ha 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:50.020
 Dr. Psycho came to our classroom and spoke with us two dimensions. We asked a question. Tell me! 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:53.540
 Do you prefer to fire or break your heart? 

00:05:54.380 --> 00:06:01.840
 No one answered but I replied and I said to fire, then he asked me why I answered! 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.540
 Because if I was shot with a bullet can be treated 

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.740
 Look at me and said: Min agree with it? 

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:15.860
 And no one answered, and he said, No one of you has broken his heart before. 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.420
 They do not know the pain 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:22.400
 They do not know the pain. He was shot with fifty bullets 

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.140
 Directly in your heart 

00:06:25.140 --> 00:06:33.460
 This is a feeling, and even if he healed it would come back not as a heart. (Bodbay 2017) 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.099
 People think it is fun and wonderful to be 

00:06:40.739 --> 00:06:41.909
 "Awake" 

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:44.748
 Lol he's in the dark it's a very bad feeling 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:48.378
 Kanek is frustrated and conscious in a society that is not conscious 

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:51.229
 In fact 

00:06:51.719 --> 00:06:53.009
 the society 

00:06:53.009 --> 00:06:55.278
 You are here ... and I am 

00:06:55.979 --> 00:07:02.389
 I'm here ... I look under you and think how stupid people are 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:09.588
 It's hard to be conscious. You did not understand the thoughts that spin in my mind! 

00:07:09.589 --> 00:07:11.589
 Yes this is my legs! 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.900
 Neil Wachd says? 

00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:18.560
 Almost all armed conflicts in history have come through 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.780
 Opponents of science believe that non-scientific things are true. My God 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.060
 Are you telling me? 

00:07:25.069 --> 00:07:29.440
 Are you telling me that humans have different and different ideas? No! 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:33.220
 This is so far away even on my open mind 

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:40.360
 I refuse to consider this a fact. Neil go to the things of science and keep them and keep away from the deep thinkers 

00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:42.740
 like me 

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:45.220
 * Zaher * (Biody hungry) 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:47.060
 I'll let you know 

00:07:47.060 --> 00:07:48.260
 "My Father 

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:54.580
 Just remember when you pull my iPhone or iPad you take me 

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.080
 my happiness" 

00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.740
 It's a fact 

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:03.860
 Biodepi most likely retreated from the form in his career this moment 

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:05.500
 Aish Khlak think of a strange thing Haha 

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:11.920
 This is true when this video ends, your happiness will end with it, but do not worry there is another video waiting for you 

00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:16.680
 Hold a bowl and throw it on the ground 

00:08:16.680 --> 00:08:18.320
 Ihah 

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:23.440
 Is it broken? Yes ... now a bit sorry ... sorry 

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:27.339
 Did he return what he was before? 

00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.040
 Laughing 

00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:30.840
 Did you understand 

00:08:32.440 --> 00:08:33.640
 I love you 

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:35.540
 Oh Gooden 

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.520
 "It's your birthday Matthew told me 

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:46.779
 Are you not excited to be 15? he asked me 

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.099
 Read my book. And then I cried, I became 

00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:57.939
 From time "because of my mind ... under here I may be 15 

00:08:58.070 --> 00:09:00.429
 Maybe I may be 12 but above here 

00:09:01.279 --> 00:09:08.079
 I am a man of advanced age with a mixture of things and a bunch of perverse sexual fantasies 

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:10.310
 do you want to see ? 

00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:13.280
 Come Come baby Come Come 

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.280
 This will end this episode 

00:09:15.340 --> 00:09:19.640
 If you think your mind will open slightly 

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:21.620
 If I learned anything today 

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:26.660
 If you write a book. Leave the triangle to the lycat if you see 

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:33.860
 Five episodes of the series Rick and Morty total. Leave four loops if your personal photo is good 

00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:36.860
 Leave five liqueurs ... This is impossible 

00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:38.960
 Which is estimated to degrade five lycates 

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.420
 Now excuse me 

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.980
 Let me go for some deeper thoughts 

00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:47.600
 * Serious thinking * 

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.000
 Oh hello 

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.380
 Do not mind me. I'm just walking in the woods (sure biody) 

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:57.050
 Or do I actually? 

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
 That's true
