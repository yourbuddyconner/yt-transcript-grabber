00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.100
Aah

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.940
My life is dull,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.220
it's not very cool

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.700
Parents at home,

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.540
teachers at school

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.520
I want to live

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.800
where it's so much more hip

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.180
I want to live

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.080
on a pirate ship!

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.500
On a pirate ship
On a pirate ship

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.020
I'll pillage the seas on a seafaring trip

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.640
On a pirate ship
On a pirate ship

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.220
On a pirate ship

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:54.000
A pirating life

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.600
would be ever so grand

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.700
Plundering gold

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.900
with a hook for my hand

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.620
- Arrr!

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.640
- I'd ride the waves

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.800
on the ocean so blue

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.460
I'd fly through the air

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.480
like pirates do.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.720
On a pirate ship
On a pirate ship

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.540
I'd soar though the air with a dart and a flip

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.280
On a pirate ship
On a pirate ship

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.740
On a pirate ship

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.640
Flying so high

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.040
and swooping for treasure

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.040
down below

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.880
Dropping swords

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.780
on my enemies

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.260
On a pirate ship
On a pirate ship

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.920
- Me eyepatch would snap and me trousers would rip

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.700
- On a pirate ship
On a pirate ship

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.160
On a pirate ship

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.340
- Sing along me hearties!

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.900
- On a pirate ship
On a pirate ship

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.680
- I'll pillage the seas on a sea faring trip

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.320
- On a pirate ship
On a pirate ship

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.160
On a pirate ship!

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.320
- Pirates!
