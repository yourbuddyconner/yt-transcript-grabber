00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.840
 Welcome to Genoa, the beautiful coastal city of northern Italy. 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.109
 It is a vertical city built on hills. 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.360
 It has so many hills that the city has many outstanding rail and lifts 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.030
 Which make its way through the rocks, and shorten 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.170
 Miles of meanders and creeps or thousands of stairs. 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.500
 The most striking of all this is "Castello d'Albertis Montegalleto". 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.039
 Or: "Elevator Castle". 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.539
 In the past, you had to walk 300 meters to the top 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.250
 But now, if you start from the bottom 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.370
 You'll find strange, cubic boxes to take you up. 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.300
 It is like any ordinary elevator, but it runs horizontally. 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.300
 Ascend it and walk your 300 meters across the rocks 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:43.100
 Pass some controls then, 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.059
 After a few transfers between the funds destined for the other side .. 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.440
 Moving vertically, 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.289
 The castle ascends to the top of the hill. 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.629
 You may now think it is a great theoretical idea, 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:56.090
 It's like a science fiction film, but it's certainly serious 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.770
 Well, I'm saying this and I'm wearing a red shirt! 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.670
 Lifts must contain all protection systems 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.330
 So that the interruption of a wire does not cause a disaster. 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.340
 Fikim managed to make one of these elevators 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.030
 When does it separate itself and ascend? 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.590
 The answer is: they can not. Because the elevator does not do so. 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.990
 The solution is somewhat clear: 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.310
 There are two independent systems here. 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.840
 This is similar to the way Disney uses the "horror tower" in the amusement park: 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.570
 The box where the passengers climb is only horizontal 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.060
 So that it is connected to a wire. 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.790
 When it arrives 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:34.180
 All enter into another larger elevator. 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.340
 So cling to the elevator tightly, 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.540
 And then moved up or down safely 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.479
 Like a traditional passenger elevator. 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.119
 It's a genius engineering. 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:48.249
 I shortened the people 300 meters to reach their elevator. 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.320
