00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.639
 The guest video of today is a bit different than normal, 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.029
 so prepare yourself for music, emoji and be told that you are good, 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.320
 when Alex from Play The Mind sings a song about translations. 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.920
 Alex, put it on. 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.020
 ♫ Give your hard and soul to me 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.890
 ♫ and life will always be 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.600
 ♫ La Vie En Rose. ♫ 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.640
 You have just heard a contrafact. 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.400
 That is when the lyrics of a song have changed, but the music remains the same. 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.260
 Parody songs are a good example of contrafacts, just like translations. 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.800
 But unlike parodies, translations of songs often give the wrong impression 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.980
 that they stay true to the original. 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:42.980
 For instance, 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.600
 what I just sang is part of an English version of a French song 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.500
 La Vie En Rose by Edith Piaf. 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.240
 The French text of what I sang is, 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.280
 "Et dès que je l'aperçois alors your sens and moi, mon cœur qui bat." 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.190
 The meaning of these words has nothing to do with what I just sang. 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.410
 In fact, the English version ends briefly, bilingual, 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.710
 sex-loving and sung directly towards the beloved, 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.969
 which characteristics are not present in the original French version. 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.509
 And this song is not the only case where this happens. 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:16.439
 With every translation of a song, 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.659
 there is a conflict between the meaning of the text and the way it sounds when it is pronounced. 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.939
 If you were to translate a song purely based on meaning, 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.680
 you get a text with counting that follows syllables, 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.590
 that naturally do not acc-ENT chalk-GEN when they are pronounced 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.070
 So, somewhere you have to sacrifice meaning to keep a good sound. 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.320
 And who is guilty of making a translation of a song so complicated? 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.350
 That is phonology. 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.569
 The phonology of a language is like its musical DNA 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:50.159
 and it has a primordial influence 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.759
 on how a melody of a song is written in a certain language. 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.549
 Even the specific way a baby cries has to do with how his mother speaks. 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.549
 There are two things that matter in phonology. 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.240
 The phonemes are the vowels and consonants that make the speech. 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.670
 and the prosody of a language is the way the phonemes come together 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.080
 to syllables, and sentences and their pronunciation 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.590
 to convey meaning there. 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:14.740
 It is the prosody of English that makes the difference between saying 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:19.880
 "Hey, you're HOT", and say "Hey, YOU'RE hot." 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.840
 But, back to music. 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.110
 It is the phonological system of a language 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.870
 that gives shape to the melody of a song originally written in that language. 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.799
 And if that song translates into a language 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.939
 with a completely different phonological system, 

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:36.730
 something bad will sound. 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.540
 For example: Some languages, such as Hindi or Italian, 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.930
 are better suited for melismatic singing, 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.319
 where several notes are sung about just a few vowels. 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:48.660
 Here is an example in English: 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.040
 ♫ If I .. 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.640
 ♫ should stay ... ♫ 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:58.340
 That was Whitney Houston. 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.969
 And other languages, such as German or Polish, 

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:03.510
 Are more suitable for syllabic singing. 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:06.000
 Where you have a note per vowel. 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.160
 ♫ Freude schöner Götterfunken 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.120
 ♫ Daren aus Elysium! ♫ 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.980
 That was Ludwig van. 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.980
 Gesundheit! 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.660
 That is where the crux of the whole lies. 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.980
 To convert the text from a syllabic language to a melismatic song 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.360
 or visa-versa, sounds forced, artificial. 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.390
 I am fully aware that no language is purely syllabic or purely melismatic, 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.769
 but I emphasize these extremes to make clear my point. 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.130
 A translation of a song may sound good, but it may be inaccurate in its meaning, 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.640
 or can be accurate, but it sounds bad. 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:44.640
 There is one. 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.480
 But, how important are translations today? 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.239
 Imagine: 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.871
 About 80 million people worldwide speak Korean, but until today 

00:03:52.871 --> 00:03:57.290
 is the most watched video on YouTube the Korean song 'Gangnam Style' 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.519
 with more than 2.5 billion views. 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:04.890
 This means that the majority of the audience probably has not understood a word from what was sung. 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.879
 Sign up for Play the Mind for all kinds of videos about music theory and acoustics, 

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.829
 including one about the first 'mic drop'. 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.280
 Next time, in the last guest video of this series, 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.449
 we have something in the always popular genre of it 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:19.310
 "That thing you eat is not what you think it is". 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.810
 Until then.
