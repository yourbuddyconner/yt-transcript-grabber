00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.330
 Behind me there is a small stream of water called Strid. 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.899
 There are a lot of Strits in Britain, 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.460
 But this is the Wharfe River, in Bolton Abbey, in Yorkshire. 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.580
 And it seems to me that this is the most dangerous stream on the Earth. 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.299
 This is a very sudden statement, I know. 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.150
 Certainly, there are rivers that have claimed more lives, 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.250
 and there are fast and waterfalls that few boats could navigate. 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.050
 But normally, you can see them. 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.529
 This just seems like an innocent stream in the middle of a forest. 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.949
 You could jump over. Many people do it. 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:33.550
 But if the jump fails, it kills you. 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.640
 This is the river about one hundred meters further up. 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.460
 The same river The same water 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.469
 Thanks to the geology of the place, the river basically turns on itself, 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.850
 Dig tunnels and passages on the rocks below. 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.520
 These streams are actually hanging: 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.079
 there is no bed below the surface, 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:57.329
 It is a deep mass of fast and deadly currents. 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.230
 It is said that falling has a 100% mortality rate 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.140
 But there is no way to confirm this, of course, 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.980
 "local man does NOT die in the river" would never be a news item, 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.500
 but that has taken many lives: 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.900
 It is even said that a boy of the XXII century, 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.030
 what would be the future king of Scotland, 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.290
 He died trying to jump to the other side of these waters. 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.200
 And any thing or person that falls 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.880
 it probably would not come out in a recognizable way: 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.170
 it will spray against the rocks under water 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.610
 over and over again. 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.170
 I would try to put a camera inside, 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.500
 but then I should get close to the edge. 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.990
 And the edge is not sharpened, it simply turns to the water 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.490
 And it's covered with slippery moss. 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.990
 In addition, the water is opaque and peat, 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.860
 so there would be nothing. 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.620
 Can you survive? Maybe, with a lot of equipment and lots of luck. 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.960
 And you will find testimonies of recklessness 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:56.090
 They have swam in the most calm areas in the background on drier days, 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.870
 But there it is a child lost their lives in 2010. 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.210
 This is the reason why it is so dangerous. 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.090
 It seems safe It seems tempting 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.570
 And he will kill you. 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.960
