00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:03.400
 This is Technical Difficulties. We play Citation Needed. 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.320
 He is accompanying me today. He reads books, you know. It's Chris Joel! 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.920
 Hey. 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.160
 Every one ... I expected that to be longer. 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:14.540
 [LAUGHTER] 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.760
 Everyone's favorite: Gary Brannan, Gary Brannan. 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.340
 Three speeds and only one of them is backwards. 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.560
 The most lively man on the internet: Matt Gray. 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.080
 Welcome, YouTube! 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.680
 For me I have an article from Wikipedia and these guests can not see it. 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.480
 Every little fact that they have good is worth a point and a 'thing' [DING]. 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.220
 And there is a price for good answers and that is .... [mysterious cakes] 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.980
 And today we talk about ... 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.620
 cello scrotum. 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.300
 Does it have anything to do with banjo strings? 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.000
 Oh. Ohh. Sorry, it took a while. 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.360
 -- I go for it. - Oh! All right. 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.920
 Is it a condition under which cellists suffer, because of the position in which they have to place themselves, 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.620
 When they play the cello? And that is why the vibrations produce a sort of, of 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.420
 painful skin rash? 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.960
 - No! - Waaahhh! 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.680
 Is it when you have two F-shaped cutouts 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.380
 In your notes, for better acoustics? 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.200
 Eh, no. No, the thing is 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.360
 That is what the article in medical literature said it was 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.000
 So I give you a point anyway [DING] 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.100
 But why is it even more remarkable? 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.740
 Has it happened to women? 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.180
 Wow! 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.060
 No. No, it did not happen to women. 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.000
 Horses? 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.920
 It has not happened to horses. 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.100
 Old blues men? Cello Scrotum? 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.360
 No. Although it is a good name. 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.280
 It has not happened to blues men either. 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.980
 It was a fantastic dose of applause that went around this one time in the Royal Philharmonic? 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.260
 You all assume that someone was injured here 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.260
 Was it just completely made up? 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.080
 A point! [THING] 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.580
 Ah! 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.900
 Complete, fully fabricated, as a number report. which changed into a what? 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.000
 Ehm, a medical journal? 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 Yes, the British medical journal [DING] 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.360
 The prestigious British Medical Journal in 1974 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.180
 And reportedly a condition among male cello players 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.420
 It was an answer to the 'gitaartepel' 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.060
 Nipple?! 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:00.100
 Guitar spoon 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.380
 What is rubbing? 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.820
 If you play your guitar so high, that's ... 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.560
 The Beatles did it for a while! 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.840
 I say, shotgun bassist! 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.420
 ♫ Bum ba-diggley bum ♫ 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.460
 Dr. Elaine Murphy thought that the person who entered the "gitaartepel" made a joke 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:17.560
 So she sent in 'cello scrotum' as a joke. 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.240
 what was published in the British Medical Journal 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.340
 without anyone pointing out what is fairly important? 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.780
 That they were testicles? 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.280
 - Hey! - Aaaww! 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.860
 It is a golf club. They are not cookies! It is a golf club! 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.180
 He is good. He is good. He is good. 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.040
 I did not even know I was making a joke until I did it! 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.580
 What was wrong with that? 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.420
 Well, you should not have a cello so high, to begin with. 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:41.780
 That's right yes. [THING] 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.220
 Between your legs, is not it? 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.260
 - Yes, get a point. - If you have a cello so high, then you have legs in that corner. 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.080
 Yes, that is completely true. 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.140
 Moreover, do not your cellos rest on an ear? 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:51.460
 So from [CHAK] 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.000
 - I will tell you something ... - [OEHAAH!] 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.360
 I'll tell you something, that's how you get cello scrotum. If you place the standard incorrectly. 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.320
 I'll give you that now. 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.600
 Yes, you are right. A cellist does not put the cello somewhere in the vicinity of ... the cross. 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.280
 Well, normally 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.320
 Speak for yourself 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.820
 Which means that Elaine Murphy, baroness Murphy, has a wonderful Wikipedia article, because at the top 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.620
 are all those sections, you know, like a member of The House of Lords ... life pear ... 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.620
 And then 'Cello Scortum' controversy. 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.720
 Point! [THING] 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:24.440
 The very last section is a well-referenced section, linking to an article by BBC, which is simply titled ... 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.000
 "Peer reveals" Cello Scortum is "hoax". 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.040
 That is one to put on the cost claim. 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.840
 Yes. Why is this important? 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.200
 Why is the fact that this was published as an article in medical literature important? 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:43.860
 Has it changed how ... did the collegial, double-blind ... review need? 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.960
 That should have been. I give you a point for that [DING]. 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:50.040
 That should certainly have been. Something like that should never end up in BMJ before someone comes for a long time 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.740
 thinking ... Cello scrotum? --REALLY? 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.760
 Cello scrotum? --REALLY? 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.760
 "Johnny, Johnny, you're playing the cello right now, would you just drop your pants, 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.800
 so that I can see that there is no redness or irritation down there? " 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.080
 "pants down!" 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:10.040
 "No ... it seems ... it seems more, more, planed, but I can not prove it's the cello, that's the problem." 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.600
 "Is it that you are fantastic deviant?" 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.380
 No, that's just the band name. Johnny and the Fantastic Deviants. 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.340
 She all played their instruments wrong. 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.680
 Ooh! 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.280
 "You would not want to see what he did with his double bass!" 

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:28.880
 "Very, very terrible, very bad for the wood." 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:32.980
 Ehm, yes. There was another publication in 1990, simply titled 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.920
 "Cello Scrotum" doubtful ". 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.980
 What sounds like the bad police report that I have ever heard. 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.200
 "Was it you ?!" 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.820
 I mainly use this to change the subject. 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:43.320
 [SNIK!] 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.080
 To a totally different load of 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.000
 "sharing human body". 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.480
 And now I'm going for a moment, doing a super fast round. 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:55.700
 What other conditions mentioned in ... that now have ... 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.740
 Henderson's Hooch? 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.100
 Shatner's Bassoon? 

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:03.000
 That is not real. that is from Brass Eye. Chris? 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.600
 Nelsons left eyeball? 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.280
 - I hope that was it. 50/50 chance it was that. - We talk about tennis arm stuff 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.280
 - Yes, that's a point [DING] - house maids knee. 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.780
 - [DING] Right. - Ehm ... 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.920
 Juggler's back! 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:15.980
 Jugglers? what is a juggler back? 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.620
 Jongleurs backside is when you always drop something and bend over the same way 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.820
 to grab the fallen juggling balls. You end up with a tear over a cheek. 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.420
 I'm curious ... I can not do a full medical literature check here ... 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:28.180
 I am very sure that it is not here. 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:29.440
 golvers nipple. 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.120
 I have no golfers nipple, I have a different body part. What is a golfers nipple? 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.460
 That is when it is cup-shaped at the end. So you can use it as a turning point, in an emergency. 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.440
 I expected during the swing. Because most golfers wear a certain type of polo 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.260
 You have to wear a colored shirt ... they wear polo t-shirts 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.380
 and these always have logos, just where the ... comme ça! 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.300
 That's correct. That's about it. it rubs the nipples, so often ... 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.440
 I've heard something of bandages underneath or something to prevent that from happening during the swing. 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.240
 Right. There are a number of reveries to that. I must admit that. But the gene that I have for waves is not the nipple. 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:05:59.920
 Elbow? 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.340
 Elbow! Point for you [DING]. Golfers elbow. 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.500
 That is exactly the same as a tennis elbow anyway? 

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:05.940
 - About and to, yes. - But longer? 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.060
 --Yes. - Implement. 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:09.960
 Not elbow ... it just grows. 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.000
 Have a long elbow. 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.300
 Can someone else feel that, if you close your fingers, kind of on the tip of your nose, there 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.600
 do you feel a kind of .... tingling? 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.800
 that's psychosomatic right? 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.880
 I can actually feel it, there. 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.760
 Wait! stop. No! we are being sounded, we all do this ... 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.680
 no not at all! really. I do not make a joke. Really. If I can 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.620
 if I hang here with my finger, I feel a tingling sensation. 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.640
 You are right! You are actually right with that. This is not hoax, viewers 

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:36.320
 - Like the time I invited you all to the podcast ... - I have a unibrow! 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.960
 I'm going to feel it! 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.840
 Yes, I can do that, but that's because it's there. 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.960
 it is further away than where you actually touch the skin. It's about here. I can feel it ... even with my eyes closed 

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:46.340
 this sounds like reiki. 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:49.420
 - in fingers or hair? - Here ... I can feel it, tingling. 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:51.500
 So that is pretty far away. That it starts to tingle. 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:52.800
 - Indeed ... - It seems to become stronger. 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.000
 It is only your body that is aware that there is something there and that 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.140
 a little nervous that someone is about to hit you. 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.060
 In the eye! It is just a funny thing that you can feel. 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.260
 Close your eyes and tell me when you can feel that I am doing it with you. 

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.600
 Do not do it daft! 

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.900
 I'm not going to do anything else, I just want you to tell me when you can feel it. 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.420
 Okay, I'm coming closer. 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:10.640
 I would like to say that I can already feel something, but I am worried that there is nothing at all right now. 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.940
 Right, you are absolutely right! 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.260
 You have it completely correct ... SCIENCE! 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:17.740
 It's the truth. But you can still feel it. It's a crazy thing. 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.360
 Right. 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.520
 So yes, golfers elbow, tennis elbow is here. What else do we have? 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:26.100
 There is nothing wrong with football players, but are they rolling over the ground? 

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.480
 cyclists sphincter? 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.200
 - Oh, actually ... there is ... - Thighs! 

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:31.020
 It is quite a narrow chair. 

00:07:31.020 --> 00:07:32.920
 Fine. That too. 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.360
 And there is also a type of tumor that cyclists get in their delicate areas. 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.000
 More sensitive to it there, than anywhere else. 

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.120
 A cyclist's tumor. 

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.320
 A bike's a tumor. 

00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.980
 It starts with peri, or not, and you do not want to google photos of it? 

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.040
 Ohh! No! Really? 

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.060
 Because you are sitting on a saddle, there are certain pressure points. 

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:48.560
 Yes. 

00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.260
 - Yes, uh, that ... - Quietly to the next ... 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:53.980
 ... strange enough, not registered as a specific complaint. 

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:58.220
 There is a total category about occupational disease, but most of them, because they are not about leisure time 

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.420
 are actually pretty terrible. 

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:01.620
 Miners black lung. [THING] 

00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:02.340
 Asbestos. 

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.520
 Vibrant white finger. [THING] 

00:08:04.780 --> 00:08:06.540
 And radium jaw. 

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:08.640
 - Oh no! That's horrible! - Oh, that brush thing. 

00:08:08.640 --> 00:08:10.600
 The phossy jaw .. phossy jaw. 

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:12.700
 Yes. You have a point [DING]. You have a point [DING] 

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:14.000
 yeah, that was gross. 

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.080
 yeah, those were the match girls. This was not just a radium paint lick alone. 

00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:20.080
 this was phosphorous licking. 

00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:21.700
 Mmm ... that's phoss jaw, is not it? 

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.860
 that is phossy jaw ... phosphorous jaw. 

00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:26.280
 There is also a reference to Eben Byers here. 

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.280
 American socialist, athlete and industrialist. 

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:34.180
 He won US amateur in golf in 1906. Eh, what happened to him? 

00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.320
 Golf ball in his face? 

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.820
 Maybe something with radiation in his jaw? 

00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:38.740
 I was hoping somebody would say that his card fell off. 

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.020
 --Oh! his jaw fell off. - His jaw fell off. 

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:42.180
 Right! Fully correct. even ... [DING] 

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:48.600
 The Wall Streat Journal has a wonderful article here, "The radium of water worked fine until its jaw fell off". 

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.380
 Ohh! No. 

00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:54.260
 He took a patent medicine that was made of what? 

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:55.020
 Radium. [THING] 

00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:55.940
 Dissolved in? 

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:56.900
 Water. [DING] 

00:08:56.900 --> 00:08:58.280
 Point! ... Points for everyone! 

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.340
 What does it call radium water? 

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.820
 it was indeed radium water, right. 

00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:03.900
 - It was a common thing. - It was called Radithor. 

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:07.600
 Yeah, there was a time when radiation cured everything. Or not? 

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:10.600
 Well, specifically, radium was not the thing that would actually cure everything. 

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:13.960
 You could take it liquid. as a suppository. You would do everything it needed. 

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.100
 We talked about this last time, right? 

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:19.740
 Yes indeed. This was the minimum of a microcurie in distilled water. 

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:25.080
 The owner of the company, head of the laboratory, was Dr. William Bailey. What was he not? 

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.280
 A doctor? 

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:29.320
 He what is not a medical doctor. No. Not even in the neighborhood. [THING] 

00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.560
 is this ... ehm ... homeopathic radium? 

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:36.680
 - No! if it was homeopathic radium ... - Would you be ocher! 

00:09:37.540 --> 00:09:40.680
 You can really buy that. I'll tell you what ... I did not have time to order it. 

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.140
 But I just thought about it ... One of the prices I thought I was buying. 

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:45.920
 I would get a physical price, not a cheap joke. 

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.080
 Because I would say: congratulations, you win homeopathic kitten chlamydia. 

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:54.540
 And then I would buy a small jar of pills with homeopathic kitten chlamydia. 

00:09:54.540 --> 00:10:00.360
 Which you could buy for four or five pounds. From the royal homeopathic pills supplier. 

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:01.680
 I'm not joking 

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:05.880
 What would I do? What should I use the homeopathic kitten chlamydia pills for? 

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:08.120
 Curing chlamydia in your kitten. 

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.460
 No joke! 

00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:10.980
 I do not believe a word. 

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:15.740
 Wait a second! So, I give my kitten chlamydia, to cure my kitten of chlamydia? 

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:19.980
 No! You give your kitten water with chlamydia first. 

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.600
 Which then heals your kitten's chlamydia. No joke! 

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.140
 But I do not ... [stutter] ... but I do not cure chlamydia by giving myself more chlamydia! 

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.260
 It does not work like that. 

00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.860
 They also sell you homeopathic Berlin wall. 

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.540
 What is that for? Communism?! 

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:34.660
 Claustrophobia. 

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:35.660
 F *** off! 

00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:40.100
 How does ... the Berlin wall was f *** ing outside! 

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:47.080
 I could walk past it. I could see the sky, the ground. I could walk in all directions except the righting where the wall stood. 

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:51.000
 Sell ​​me a room if you want to cure me of claustrophobia! 

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.120
 The only way I can be cured from the berlin wall is the intolerance between East and West Germany. 

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:57.700
 That is ridiculous! 

00:10:58.500 --> 00:10:59.060
 Breath(!) 

00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.360
 Eat some concrete, if that's your problem! 

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.060
 Take it easy. Quiet... 

00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:09.380
 William Bailey who the man who sold the radium of water was never dragged to justice 

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.500
 for the dead he caused. 

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:12.920
 Even... 

00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:14.880
 Well, he was dragged to court in a large amount of water. 

00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:15.380
 Yes. 

00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.300
 Not homeopathic. If that was it ... it would not have killed him. 

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:23.100
 I'm sorry, that was me with the homeopathic drink, was not it? 

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:28.100
 The federal trade commission, the US government, stopped its radium water trade. 

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.540
 What was he going to do then? 

00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:30.420
 Radium beer? 

00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:32.260
 Radium milk? 

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.320
 Radium letters? 

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:37.040
 Ah, you know what? Radium paper weights. You can have a point for that. [THING] 

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.400
 - S *****! - Radi-weight? 

00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.880
 Eh, yes. Radioactive belt clips. But more importantly ... 

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:44.600
 "Warm your balls!" 

00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.260
 But more importantly ... a mechanism that did something with water? 

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:49.240
 Heated it? 

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.180
 Yes, I would have done that. 

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:51.060
 With radium. 

00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.480
 Yes! It made water radioactive, so that you could make your own radium water. [THING] 

00:11:55.940 --> 00:11:58.920
 Even though it was proven that people were dead? 

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:01.940
 Ah, yes ... yes, indeed. That was he made ... 

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:04.300
 Well, he knew what he wanted and he went for it. 

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:10.260
 Yes. Now that we are working on this. We have Eben Byers, that was the person from whom the jaw dropped. 

00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:10.760
 Yes. 

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:15.060
 He is buried in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. What was so special with his funeral? 

00:12:15.060 --> 00:12:15.940
 Lead coffin? 

00:12:15.940 --> 00:12:18.020
 Point! [DING] Lead coffin. Perfect. 

00:12:18.020 --> 00:12:19.900
 That was because they did not want to irradiate everyone. 

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.280
 Yes! And they did not want to contaminate the soil around him. 

00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:22.780
 Hmm. 

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:28.120
 So we have a golfer elbow, tennis elbow, we have a cello scrotum, all of which were not true. 

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:31.860
 Ah! We also have ehm ... oh, [LONG BEEP] 

00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:34.060
 He has seen a picture of it! 

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.000
 I've clicked on what was tagged as "jeep ass". 

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:40.740
 Okay. 

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.500
 Is that where your wheel has traces? 

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:44.000
 No! 

00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:47.040
 You remember that I was talking about cyst? 

00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:47.800
 Yes! 

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:48.400
 No! 

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.620
 It left me right ... it just went ... directly to that ... photo! 

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:55.220
 That is the risk I take with this screen in front of me. 

00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:56.600
 Have you just seen a curved buttock of a man? 

00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.760
 Aah! Yes. 

00:12:57.760 --> 00:12:58.920
 Gecyst! 

00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:00.160
 Oh! He is completely cyst ... 

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:01.780
 What happened to Dave? Oh, he was completely cyst. 

00:13:01.780 --> 00:13:03.220
 As all doctors call it. 

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:04.880
 The last. 

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.280
 Is Nintendo thumb. 

00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:10.560
 That's because of playing console games all night. 

00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.280
 [DING] Yup. 

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:16.180
 It can not only be Nintendo. Other consoles ... you can not have PS3 pink? Or something. 

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:17.520
 No no. They have that tricked market. 

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.760
 Yes, it's just like gamer's grip. It is just RSI. 

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.020
 But if you go with Nintendo, what kind of word joke can you give that? 

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:30.780
 Given that it has to do with Nintendos ... and the things we are talking about here. 

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.340
 - So tendons? - Veins? 

00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:35.020
 Ninten ... Oh ... Nintendonites! 

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.360
 POINT! [THING] 

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.280
 Correct. 

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.440
 Imagine, they were in a circle with their white jackets on, and their stethoscopes. 

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:46.180
 Nintend ... Nintendonites! 

00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:50.420
 Even more worrying, I think I now understand how Sega Stones was invented. 

00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:52.520
 They had to stop making consoles. 

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.040
 Ah! Here we go. 

00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:57.080
 Just like: X-box. 

00:13:57.720 --> 00:13:58.880
 Aaw! 

00:14:01.780 --> 00:14:03.860
 Congratulations Gary, you will win this week's show. 

00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:04.500
 Alright! 

00:14:04.500 --> 00:14:06.420
 You win a subscription to the Das van de Maand club. 

00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:06.920
 Ooh! 

00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:08.680
 Try to be at home when they deliver it. 

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:11.060
 They get a little angry if you leave them with the neighbors. 

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:14.140
 And with that, we thank you, Cris Joel. 

00:14:14.140 --> 00:14:14.660
 Woo! 

00:14:14.660 --> 00:14:15.780
 And Gary Brannan. 

00:14:15.780 --> 00:14:16.280
 Matt Gray. 

00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:16.780
 Bye! 

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.640
 I'm Tom Scott and we'll see you next time.
