Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan, Gary Brannan.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.560
Join me in my secret expedition,

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.300
to Noel Edmonds' secret underground bunker...

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.180

Today's show is sponsored by the word cuneiform.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.680
Getting highbrow here.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.160
In front of me I have an article from
Wikipedia and these folks can't see it.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:27.780
Every fact they get right is a a point, and a...

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:29.040
You OK there?

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.880
Might be reaching coffee saturation.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.820
I'll start being funny any minute now.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.600
Can we just...

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:39.780
Good siren noise there.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.480
Can we just take a minute to acknowledge 
how good that siren noise was?!

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.240
In front of me I've got an article from 
Wikipedia and these folks can't see it.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.880
Every fact they get right is a a point, and a ding [DING].

particularly good answers which is:

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.300
You will put your back out doing that
at some point, Gary.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.100
All in the name of wit.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.500
And today we are talking about Thomas Midgley Jr.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.240
Son of Thomas Midgley?

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.280
I mean one would assume so, yeah.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.080
It doesn't explicitly say that here.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.520
It'll be under early life. I'm pretty sure.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.440
It's not! It just said where he was born.
Which was the town of Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.820
Also known as a 'Slut Drop'.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.640
I said that before I thought about it!

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.620
- That's a better joke than I was thinking about.
- Pennsylvania, you're it this week!

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.320
Either that, or it's a town at the bottom of a cliff.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.580
Above it is a large woodland. 
With a very heavily disguised edge of cliff.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.020
"What are we going to call this place?"

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.800
That's my impression of a beaver, by the way.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.600
I don't know what noise they make 
when they hit the ground, I've never seen it.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.480
A siren noise by the sound of it.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.960
Oh, it's a trumpet.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.540
Yeah.

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:01.180
Yeah. Grew up in Ohio, then. And went to Cornell University with a degree in mechanical engineering.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.880
He sounds like an awful person(!)

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.380
His father was an inventor and he was an inventor
and he made, I think a... great change to the world.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.500
Although it might not have been for the better.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.020
The automatic French horn?

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.280
Why would you need an
automatic French horn, Gary?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.420
To save you having the trouble of
playing a French horn, dickhead!

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:22.860
You've got player pianos, why not player French horns?

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:23.680
-Yeah!
-OK! Yeah!

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.080
Come on. It's the general trend towards
playerisation of the entire orchestra.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.180
They just stumbled on the kettle drum.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.620
It's a self-boiling kettle drum.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.660
It's just a kettle with the drum attached to it and steam...

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.540
"That's not quite what we had in mind. 
But useful in the morning!"

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.860
Eight am.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.240
"But I do have hot water for tea now, so that's good."

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.480
And everybody's awake!

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.100
No.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.100
That's not what he invented.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.820
I'm out.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.720
Tom, are you asking us of all the things that could 
have been invented in the 1900s

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.600
I was hoping that you might hit on something
I could move towards it. But no...

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.260
Ivory harvesting machine?

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:04.840
...since you went with automatic French horn and ivory harvesting machine, no! Nothing like that.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:08.340
Let me see if I can narrow this down a bit. He was working at Dayton Research Laboratories.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.460
Oh! Dayton Research Laboratories!

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.380
Still no idea.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:14.820
...which are a subdivision of General Motors.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.940
So what would he be working on, 
in about 1920? This is December 1921.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.100
Nuclear powered car?

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.380
The double decker bus?

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.180
No, no, but you are technically closer. It's something to do with how cars are powered.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.900
Nuclear powered double decker bus!

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:31.920
I mean...

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.140
That's a great film actually.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.900
That's combining both noes there.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:36.240
Wait. What film is that? I remember that.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.180
- The Big Bus.
- The Big Bus!

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.240
Big Bus, brilliant.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.260
All I remember is someone pulling a lever and the flags of all nations popping out of the top of it.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.100
Yep. Yeah.

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.100
Wow!

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.260
It actually predates Airplane! as well.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.820
- It was a comedy, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:47.500
Aaw!

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:49.160
Well "comedy".

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.120
If you want a serious one, did
you hear about Supertrain?

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.260
No?

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.440
This was a massive flop for NBC, in the US.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.900
It was one of the worst, one of the most expensive
and greatest television failures of all time.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.060
This sounds like it should be in 
my DVD collection already.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.660
You know how they had the Love Boat?

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:07.360
I do know how they had the Love Boat.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.660
Would you explain the Love Boat for our viewers?

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:14.260
The Love Boat was a serial. I think it was probably weekly or something. Where you have a cruise liner.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.480
A boat went around, trying to shag other boats.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.360
My God! The one with the oil tanker! 
You should have seen that one.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.780
Lubricated.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:28.200
That's kinda what it sounded like.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.460
Make sure this one is called the 
'Gary Brannan Sound Effects Special'

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.440
As I have just done a cruise liner shagging an oil tanker.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.080
Actually, yeah! Sorry!

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.020
♫[MYSTERY BISCUITS]♫

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.460
Recognise the effort this series.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:47.160
Erm, no. I don't think it was a comedy. It was a kind of a light drama maybe. Romantic drama.

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.080
Where you had a cruise liner...

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.440
So was this like Tugs?

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.640
No, no, no, no.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.900
Wow! I bloody love Tugs.
Tugs, by the way, to digest...

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.760
- Digest?!
- Tugs was like Thomas the Tank Engine on water.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:01.820
We are now three diversions deep.
But keep going.

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.620
- We'll circle back round.
- Tinder username!

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:10.580
This is, I think, the third season in a row...

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.240
where you have referenced Tinder, despite 
being the one married person at the table.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.580
Yeah! The one who's safest to reference
it without any eyes swivelling on it.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:18.300
That's fair.

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.840
But the Love Boat is a giant cruise liner...

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.080
and you have guest stars every week and romantic things would happen, while at sea.

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:24.700
- Right.
- But because you're in international waters...

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.660
there's all manners of deviancy you could get up to.

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.280
This was the point. You could have a 
steady, regular cast for the crew...

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.300
and guest stars each week, 
for the passengers on the ferry.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:35.440
Superdeathtrain!

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.960
Supertrain.

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.340
Which was NBC going,

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:44.280
"Huh. They've got that, what can we do differently so it's not a complete ripoff? Let's put it on a train."

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.400
Wow!

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.400
"Let's put it on a nuclear powered train, that goes from New York to Los Angeles, in 36 hours."

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.440
"That's a great idea. That can't possibly fail."

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.500
Yes, when you do the math, that means 
the train is doing about 80 miles an hour.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.580
That's hardly impressive.

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.240
That's hardly impressive at all. No.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.260
In fact you can do that on the West Coast Main Line.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.920
You actually could.

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:07.940
Double width train, so you can get
some sets and things like that.

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:11.080
- Of course.
- Stupid, stupid idea from start to finish.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.880
But it was like, "this is the big series. This is what we're going to do."

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:15.280
Sounds expensive.

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.900
Yes, it was massively expensive... it did not work.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:21.060
Why did we talk about Supertrain?

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:23.580
- I don't know. We talked about nuclear powered...
- Big Bus.

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.620
- Nuclear powered bus. The Big Bus.
- Big bus.

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:26.760
Yep.

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.840
- And then where were we...
- And I said nuclear powered cars.

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:31.360
- Because it was an invention for the motor.
- Because he was working in Dayton...

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.440
Because Thomas Midgley Jr...

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.400
invented something about how cars were powered.

00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.220
God, I watched Inception last night. 
And this is more difficult.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.220
That's not surprising, I've seen Inception.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.080
What was the invention in the 1920s?

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.600
That would reduce the...

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.600
- That would make engines more effective.
- Was it an electric car?

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.280
No it wasn't.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.680
No, it was definitely petrol. In fact this
was something to do with the petrol.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.760
Leaded petrol?

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.340
Point! [DING]

00:06:57.700 --> 00:06:59.060
Absolutely spot on.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.720
Nice. Nice, harmonisation there.

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:02.940
Yeah, that was good.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:06.200
He added tetraethyl lead...

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.260
The scamp!

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.580
...to petrol and discovered it reduced 'knocking'.

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.700
On heaven's door?

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:12.220
Yes! Yes that's why...

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:15.100
"Do you need to cure Bob Dylan?
Use lead!"

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:17.620
(That worked for JFK.)

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:23.420
"What did he die of?"
"Lead poisoning."

00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:32.020
Do you know, when it got to unleaded cars,
in the early 90s, when it started coming in?

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.700
They stopped selling four star. 
Four star petrol used to be leaded petrol.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:36.780
-And two star.
-And two star, they stopped selling it.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.980
A relative of mine, who shall remain nameless,
he's an older gentleman, shall we say

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:45.660
Decided he wanted to convert his car to use unleaded petrol. It was quite an expensive procedure.

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:50.860
So what he did was, he got unleaded petrol. Put it in the tank, and then bought, through a magazine

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.940
today it would have been off a dodgy web site, 
but in those days it was a magazine

00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:59.340
some 'thing' you could put in your tank,
to make your car unleaded.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:02.240
When they came, it was effectively lead shot.

00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:07.920
So he put unleaded petrol in... lead shot in,
which re-adds lead. Let's face it.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.560
And he was convinced that his car was running on unleaded petrol, with all the benefits thereof.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.120
Genius!

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:20.320
So this was the problem. Lead in petrol does
reduce 'knocking'. What's the problem there?

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:21.380
- It adds lead.
- It adds lead!

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:23.360
Yes, absolutely. Have a point [DING]

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.600
It adds extremely toxic lead.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.740
Which then gets sprayed out,
in the exhaust, over everyone nearby.

00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.480
Which is why we went to unleaded petrol. 
Which is why we had all that.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:33.880
Because lead is bad!

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.820
If you didn't know that.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:40.740
What happened in 1923, just two years later,
with Midgley? What did he do?

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:42.160
[CHORUS] Die of lead poisoning!

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:47.720
I mean not quite, I'm not actually giving 
anyone a point there, because, between the...

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:51.360
no one was a third of a
point close enough, to get that word.

00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:56.500
But he did take a prolonged vacation, 
to cure himself of lead poisoning.

00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.440
What did they call the addition?

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.160
Lead.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:01.440
No!

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:07.760
No. They knew that would not work well for marketing, so with tetra, ethyl and lead, They picked?

00:09:07.760 --> 00:09:08.920
-Plumbum.
-Plumbum!

00:09:08.920 --> 00:09:11.640
Pumbum, ooh! Latin joke!

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:12.740
'Tis indeed.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:15.560
Yeah, but you can't say 'Putting bum in your petrol tank'!

00:09:15.560 --> 00:09:16.540
No, they went with ethyl

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:17.580
Plumbum petrol.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.760
"Plumbum petrol, good for you and your car!"

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:21.980
So they had a prototype plant...

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:23.380
They started making the stuff...

00:09:23.380 --> 00:09:24.740
You don't make lead form plants.

00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:26.500
Isn't a prototype plant a seed?

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.060
They had a prototype factory.
Where they were making the stuff.

00:09:31.060 --> 00:09:32.780
What happened to the people who worked there?

00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:34.340
[CHORUS] They all got lead poisoning!

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:36.060
Point. [DING] Yes.

00:09:37.520 --> 00:09:39.860
So this is clearly quite dangerous stuff.

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:43.760
Midgley called a press conference,
to demonstrate its safety.

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.140
What did he do to demonstrate?

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.320
Sprayed it onto some kids!

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.200
He ate a sandwich made of lead.

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.420
Killed the journalist, through lead poisoning.

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:54.840
He produced a song and dance number 'Lead! It's Great!'

00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:56.800
He had a lead lolly.

00:09:57.460 --> 00:09:58.960
Lead lolly, yellow lolly!

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.700
He turned up on a set, 
made entirely of lead, and produced a sitcom.

00:10:06.700 --> 00:10:08.520
-You're all...
-Right?

00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:12.560
-Dancing around...
-Did he writhe around in lead shot?

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.140
-You know like...
-What a great age Victoriana was!

00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.720
You know like mud wrestling, but lead wrestling.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:20.420
You know what Matt? You're bloody 
close enough. No one else is going to get it

00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.520
[DING] He wrestled in lead?

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.100
No, he poured the stuff all over his hands...

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.600
Yeah?

00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:29.400
and then just put the bottle under his nose,
for sixty seconds, just sniffed it... for a while.

00:10:30.020 --> 00:10:31.440
And then died of lead poisoning.

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.680
He claimed...

00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:36.480
He's already got the first signs of lead poisoning,
of madness, already. Let's face it.

00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:38.700
Well he claimed, that...

00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:40.720
Hang on! Lead? He poured lead

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:42.260
Not liquid?

00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:44.700
Poured... the stuff with lead in it

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:46.400
The stuff they were putting in the petrol

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.120
Molten lead over his hands.

00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:49.340
Argh!

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.080
"This is fine, really!"

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:56.660
He said he could do this every day, without succumbing to any problems whatsoever. What then happened?

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.360
He died?

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.480
-He succumbed to lead poisoning? 
-Lead poisoning?

00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.740
No, he managed to survive.

00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:00.660
His hands fell off?

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:02.200
There and then.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.420
"Well this is embarrassing!"

00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:11.160
I'll give Chris the point [DING]. 
He retired, because of lead poisoning.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:12.540
'Cause of lead.

00:11:12.540 --> 00:11:13.640
Did I even say that?

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.280
I mean I'll take it.

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:19.540
To be honest, I kinda kept track, 
all amidst the ridiculous suggestions

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:21.880
of what you could do with lead at a press conference .

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.680
-I kind of...
-Are you saying you couldn't writhe around in lead?

00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.900
At a press conference?

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.080
-I mean that...
-Call a press conference!

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.880
You'd get quite severe burns.

00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.160
He's in a lead suit

00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:34.520
-It's rather...
-"Hello? Bring me the lead..."

00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.920
"Also, tell me what accent this is."

00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.120
"I don't know..."

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:39.880
"And why I'm speaking in to my hand?"

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.160
"Sir! That is lead."

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:44.980
"Fantastic!"

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.840
So needless to say, he didn't have 
a great effect on the environment.

00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:52.620
Well, I mean he had a great 
effect on the environment. It wasn't a...

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:54.920
-Good one.
-A 'great'... effect...

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:56.020
on the environment.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.420
So he moved on to somewhere else, in General Motors.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:58.920
Yes?

00:11:58.920 --> 00:12:04.380
He moved out of that division. Obviously lead went
on to be quite successful... as a thing, in petrol.

00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:06.900
Did he move on to drinkable arsenic? 
Or something like that?

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.300
Well, you say that!

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.480
He did.

00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:12.540
Did he put lead in the windows? Or lead in the...

00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:15.900
Leaded windows on cars. All little hexagons

00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:18.200
Stained glass cars.

00:12:18.540 --> 00:12:22.120
Beautiful image of St. Christopher
on the rear window. It really, really is.

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:22.740
Admit it...

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.120
It needs thousands of pounds now 
to replace it now. It really does.

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.820
Admit it. You want it though don't you?

00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:28.420
Of course I ****ing want it.

00:12:29.380 --> 00:12:31.540
Why doesn't the Popemobile have that?

00:12:32.340 --> 00:12:34.820
Very difficult to make that bullet proof, I imagine.

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.400
Oh, that's fair. That's fair.

00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:39.380
Stained polycarbonate, doesn't 
really have the same ring about it.

00:12:39.380 --> 00:12:40.360
You just need the lead then.

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:41.640
Forget the window.

00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:44.180
It's an actual leaded window.

00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.240
It's lead lined lead.

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.640
You might be being a bit
generous with window there, Matt.

00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:49.260
It's safe from...

00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:50.580
Just a shield.

00:12:50.580 --> 00:12:51.700
It's safe from Superman though.

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:54.020
Superman can no longer see the Pope. That's fine.

00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:57.480
Oh yeah, 'cause that's how Superman gets his kicks.

00:12:58.020 --> 00:13:00.880
We technically have two popes, which is quire rare.

00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:02.240
-I don't have any popes.
-Well...

00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:04.940
I mean you guys have been in my house.
If you can find one pope!

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:08.040
You've got a pope infestation.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.200
"Oh, I'll tell you what mate, it'll take a while to get..."

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:14.320
I've tried spraying in Anglicanism. It's not shifting 'em.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.180
The weirdest thing is, they don't breed. But you know.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.800
The thing is, you could bring in your Anglicanism, 
but you just end up with an infestation

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.640
of bishops and archbishops, which are even
harder to get rid of, because they...

00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:26.700
Because they can only move diagonally!

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:33.140
Thomas Midgley Junior, meanwhile

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.240
Meanwhile, back at the Popemobile.

00:13:35.640 --> 00:13:37.220
Having retired from that...

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.020
This is a day of sound effects for you.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.100
Having...

00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:45.300
Can we have a goose please?

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:48.400
Go back to the old standards.

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:49.620
And let's go for train.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:51.520
And both together.

00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.020
Thank you.

00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:54.980
That was a good one. A good combo one.

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:56.480
That's one of the better ones in recent years.

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:57.300
Old school! Old school.

00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:04.380
He moved on from the cars divisions of 
General Motors and he moved to Frigidaire.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:07.540
Oh for ****s sake he put loads 
of CFCs in the atmosphere!

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.460
Point! [DING]

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.920
Absolutely right!

00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:12.360
What a ****!

00:14:14.320 --> 00:14:17.580
I think on a list of people who shouldn't have bothered...

00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:19.280
He's on it!

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.440
Can you imagine, wherever one might end up,
beyond the icy veil of the hereafter

00:14:23.660 --> 00:14:27.080
He's sat there. 'So what did you do in life?'.
'Well I invented leaded petrol...'

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:31.400
'Right and ...'
'But then I moved on to putting lots of more dangerous

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:33.420
chemicals in the atmosphere, after that.'

00:14:33.420 --> 00:14:35.880
All of our problems now, are his fault!

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.740
Are his fault.

00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:42.740
This is the thing. What did CFCs, and what did
all the new stuff, the Freon and things he put in fridges...

00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:43.940
...fix?

00:14:43.940 --> 00:14:45.300
What was there before?

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:47.600
What's more dangerous than that?

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.940
What's more immediate. If you didn't know,
because to be fair, they didn't know...

00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:52.420
what would happen with CFCs.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.540
If you don't know that. 
What are they a safe alternative to?

00:14:57.840 --> 00:14:59.660
Some other kind of gas that's cooling

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:00.540
Ammonia.

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.220
[CHORUS] Ah!

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:08.480
Ammonia is very good at being compressed.
And as a heat exchanger, it's pretty much unparalleled.

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:12.480
But it is extremely toxic and 
extremely unsafe and a little bit...

00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:15.820
There are some alternatives.
I've got chloromethane or propane.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.960
Ooh! Propane powered fridge!

00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:19.000
Yes! That's...

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:20.220
It's not ideal.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.420
Electrical fault...

00:15:21.660 --> 00:15:24.080
Yes. That was one of the problems with it.

00:15:24.080 --> 00:15:27.100
You are just coming back to lots of houses with holes in their roofs, where the fridges went upwards.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:28.100
That kind of thing.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.180
If it's good enough for Indiana Jones...

00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:38.800
Yes. He basically invented the idea of using CFCs as refrigerants, and then into aerosol spray cans.

00:15:38.800 --> 00:15:40.680
And... things like that.

00:15:40.680 --> 00:15:43.000
-And he won medals for this, because, to be fair...
-Oh, he would have.

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.260
-They did...
-Better than the alternative.

00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:48.500
Better than the alternative, but the 
long term consequences weren't known

00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:51.220
The King's Medal for Environmental ****ery, I think.

00:15:51.220 --> 00:15:54.460
He's actually on an interesting list, in Wikipedia.

00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:56.800
because the manner of his death

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.740
is also somewhat unusual.

00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:01.660
Is he on the list of unusual deaths on Wikipedia?

00:16:01.660 --> 00:16:02.320
He is.

00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:03.700
Auto-erotic asphyxiation?

00:16:03.700 --> 00:16:06.620
You're right on two words there. Auto and asphyxiation.

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:08.200
He didn't do an Isadora Duncan, did he?

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:10.120
You are going to have to explain that reference.

00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:15.420
Isadora Duncan, Nineteen, twentieth century actress, was killed by her scarf becoming entangled in

00:16:15.420 --> 00:16:19.500
the back wheel. Her long scarf in an open top car, becoming entangled in the back wheel.

00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:20.780
I thought you said Wizadora.

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:22.600
Very different.

00:16:23.060 --> 00:16:25.160
He contracted polio, at 51.

00:16:25.900 --> 00:16:29.220
Which left him quite severely disabled.
So he's an inventor.

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:30.680
He's bed ridden.

00:16:30.680 --> 00:16:32.340
He didn't invent the iron lung did he?

00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.860
No, the motorised bed.

00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:37.060
He's got a grabby system of 
a series of ropes and pulleys.

00:16:37.060 --> 00:16:37.720
Point. [DING]

00:16:37.720 --> 00:16:38.900
And he accidentally roped and pulley'd himself.

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:39.780
Point again [DING]

00:16:39.780 --> 00:16:43.260
Absolutely right. He invented an 
elaborate system of strings and pulleys...

00:16:43.820 --> 00:16:47.760
and he got entangled in it, 
and there was nothing he could do about that.

00:16:48.560 --> 00:16:50.420
That is a heck of a way to go!

00:16:51.140 --> 00:16:53.100
Did he end up getting buried in lead?

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:55.480
Lead casket, yeah.

00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.900
I doubt it?

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:58.620
With a lot of coolant.

00:16:58.620 --> 00:16:59.480
They buried him in a fridge.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:01.940
-Lead fridge.
-A lead fridge.

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:05.640
So at the end of the show. Congratulations Matt.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.600
I'm giving you the win here.

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.980
You win a hellbound Ford Transit,

00:17:09.980 --> 00:17:14.260
previously owned by a Belgian action star, 
that's had a genetic copy made of its mandible.

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:17.640
Van Damme's... van...?

00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.020
Van Damme's damned van...

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:20.580
and...

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.440
something.

00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:24.460
It's Jean Claude van Damme's 
damned clone-jawed van.

00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:26.560
I tried!

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.220
So congratulations there.

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:32.000
With that, we say goodbye to Chris Joel.

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:32.980
To Gary Brannan.

00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:34.440
To Matt Gray.

00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:35.140
Bye bye YouTube.

00:17:35.140 --> 00:17:37.120
I've been Tom Scott and we'll see you next time.

00:17:37.580 --> 00:17:39.580
