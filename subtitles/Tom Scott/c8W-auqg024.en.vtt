00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
 This will not be a normal video 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.900
 We're going to send garlic bread to the edge of the room! 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.900
 Many people have sent objects into space with balloons. 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.200
 usually as advertising stunt. 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.750
 But contrary to what many press releases say 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.420
 these objects have not been in space. 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.630
 Most standards organizations agree 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.110
 that the space starts on the completely arbitrary, 100 km high, Kármán line. 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.720
 And these balloons only come to about 1/3 of this height. 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.510
 And we certainly do not put it in orbit around the earth 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.020
 A job around the earth requires a speed of tens of thousands of kilometers per hour 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.820
 That's what these rockets are for. 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.500
 - We use a weather balloon today. 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.560
 Quite a big one, actually. 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.420
 We go as high as we can with this cargo. 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.540
 It is very cold on the way up. 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.960
 It gets warmer when you reach this kind of altitude. 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.650
 So it is the coldest just above the jet stream 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.580
 and then it gets a little warmer again. 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.690
 Then the temperature drops again to about 0 ° C at the spot where the balloon bursts. 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.220
 - The idea that all those publicity stunts really made it to space 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.440
 is helped by using a fish eye lens (fisheye lens). 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.130
 it ensures that the roundness of the earth seems a lot more dramatic 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.910
 then he really is at that height 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.940
 We use cameras that correct for that 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.290
 so what you see on your screen is more or less what you would see up there. 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.530
 So we do not say "space" but "the edge of space", 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.960
 which is actually a kind of marketing term, but the atmosphere is so thin above it, 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.930
 about 1% of the air pressure down here, that it is good enough. 

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:39.470
 Why garlic bread? 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.140
 Because it is very tasty, 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.400
 and because someone has already sent pizza up with a balloon a few years ago. 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.600
 - This garlic bread is delicious. 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.680
 It is home-made. Well, except for the baguette. 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.310
 I put homemade garlic butter on it, with some really good Parmesan cheese. 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.440
 Although I made it at 5 o'clock this morning. 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.930
 So it's going to be in a near-vacuum. 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.760
 It could be that it is frozen. I mean... 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.950
 We send half the air in the balloon 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.810
 and the other half we leave on earth for a real comparative test. 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.660
 - The higher it goes, the thinner the atmosphere becomes 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.560
 and the less air it pushes in. 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.140
 The balloon will then become larger and larger 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.200
 and will eventually burst 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.250
 and the equipment goes down on a parachute 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.354
 and we're going to pick it up. 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.720
 Usually we predict the landing site with a precision of about eight kilometers 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.563
 when we release the balloon. 

00:02:44.563 --> 00:02:48.180
 We trace the balloon with radio tracers. 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.620
 They send a signal with a GPS position to the ground 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.860
 and it is shown on a map and we chase the expected landing place of the balloon. 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.410
 I have done a lot of hot balloon trips. 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.810
 I've been doing it for about ten years now. 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.560
 Have never lost one. Have sent a few to their damnation. 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.103
 - All types of food have been sent into the stratosphere. 

00:03:08.103 --> 00:03:10.670
 The BBC once sent a wedding cake up for a children's program 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.970
 but the bottom line was that nobody really ate it. 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.700
 I have never found balloon-launched food that was actually eaten after landing. 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.809
 The main reason for this is that you have no idea 

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:21.970
 from where it's going to land, where it's going to land, 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.410
 or what kind of animals are there before you. 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.310
 - The box that I designed has a small servomotor, 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.830
 and a piece of rope and some (jumping) feathers. 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.683
 As it comes down, the servomotor closes at 1000 meters (1km) from the ground. 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.963
 - So now we have to put our cars in and behind the load. 

00:03:46.962 --> 00:03:50.000
 It's going to land about a kilometer for us 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.960
 so, Barry, keep an eye on the sky, 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.610
 because I have to keep my eyes on the road. 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.890
 Do you think we can park here? 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:00.213
 Okay, let's go. 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.320
 - It's there at the end of that row. 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.420
 - Okay, there we go. 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:12.860
 - O man! - I think it's up there. 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:16.580
 Well, we have at least two cameras. 

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.783
 Yes, I think they are both still filming. 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.424
 - Okay, then we go. - Lift it up. 

00:04:25.424 --> 00:04:26.803
 - Ah yes! - Yeah. 

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.620
 - Okay, so this is your original right? 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.160
 - Yes Yes. 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.230
 - That's very tasty. 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:33.750
 - Not bad, is it? 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:34.793
 - Space bread ... 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.760
 - Is it cold? 

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.320
 - It's not so ... Oh! 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.680
 No, that was completely different. 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.900
 So it ripped; he did [tear noise]. 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.720
 This did "click". 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.360
 - The middle is absolutely frozen. 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.233
 - Oh, wow. 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:53.460
 - I do not know, I mean ... - That's frozen. 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.350
 That is frozen in the stratosphere. 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.654
 - You can see some of the color in the middle. 

00:04:56.654 --> 00:04:57.580
 It's whiter, is not it? 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.080
 - This has been in the stratosphere and I am eating it. 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.860
 Kind of. 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.360
 Thank you, Steve Randall from Random Aerospace 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.040
 and Barry Lewis from My Virgin Kitchen. 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.610
 I do not really know what I did in this process. 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.600
 I'm actually just playing the DJ Khaled here. 

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.360
 - Yeah, yeah. 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.570
 DJ Garl-ed? No, that wordgrap does not work. 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.170
 - Okay, yes, it's okay, we're done. - Yes. Sorry. 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.033
 Thanks everyone!
