 He sat there with his phone and waited but was very afraid to say anything 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:46.230
 His very soon started crying and I try to calm her because 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:50.790
 I did not want them to bother the dog but they would not stop there I remember 

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:56.100
 This actually very soon gets on and walks on as he started running his hands 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:07:00.330
 Through her hair I asked what was wrong and I answered it maybe 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:04.320
 Hungry or something like that so Pierce put down his phone picked up 

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:13.200
 My knees and his shirt lift he breast feeding her there in the middle 

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.360
