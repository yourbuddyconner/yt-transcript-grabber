00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:08.160
 Can you not look at me or do anything to me? It would be great. 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.820
 Thank you 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.820

喔* Beating sound* 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.120
 Ok 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.940
 Why is there a sound of tapping? 

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.560
 Not allowed to run in the corridor 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:16.420

 When did you understand? 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.760
 Oh 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:23.520
 "When do you know when?" 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.900

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.780
 What is this game? 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.790
 Ok, two seconds. 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.479
 Why do everyone make a chicken* face? Seriously..?

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.560

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.280
 I got a coin! 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.740
 Ok, this is usually a good thing. 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.340
 Ok. We are at school 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.180
 It's like an ordinary school game 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:02.400
 Hey, we got a piece of chocolate now. 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.020
 Wow! What a great game. What a great game, everyone. 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.900

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.100
 Oh no 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.840
 No 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.085
 Damn 

00:03:10.085 --> 00:03:11.020
 God 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.020
 *You left me * 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.180
 *You should be very clear* 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:15.660
 I am certain 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.100
 He is right 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.260
 Ok, we haven't been spanked yet. So, I think we will be fine. 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.580
 I am a little scared 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:24.720
 Some things... some things in this game are not quite right 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.620
 What is this? 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.020
 Ok, I think we just need to find more notebooks. 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:30.680
 Ok.. 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.940
 I just want to... 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.043
 I just have to answer them all. 

00:03:35.043 --> 00:03:36.180
 Who is angry? And why is it angry? 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.960
 I am that angry. 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:40.140
 I am the one that should be angry (゚皿゚メ) 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.500
 Another notebook 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.160
 Does it make any sense to do these things? Oh my god 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.900
 (7+6=12??) 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.900
 Wait. 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.600
 Cut that paragraph off 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.640
 That's right. 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.240
 I used to study mathematics at university. 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.849
 Ok, we found the student restaurant. Cool. Can I use these things? 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:58.680
 Ok, no. 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.020
 God, it’s him. 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.520
 SH * T 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.620
 Do not beat me 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.300
 Do not beat me 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.300
 God. 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.880
 God 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.440
 No! 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.260
 No!!!!! 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.400
 I use the same as running and running. 

00:04:11.472 --> 00:04:11.972
 Damn 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:17.709
 (Funny) 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.769
 Ok, I don't think so. I don't think we will go in Tian A!!! 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:29.620
 This is a beautiful picture. You know, I don't want to say that, but I think we are watching a game of the year. 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.700
 What else do I have to do? Oh, wait, I am an idiot. 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.700
 (Swedish swear words) No!!!!... 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.800
 *Not allowed to run in the corridor* 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.200
 I don't care about Le. 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.740
 damn it. Stay in school and see. I will tell your parents. 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.549
 Please don't tell my parents. What exactly is this? 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.680
 A fingertip gyro. A fingertip gyro!!!!! 

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.580
 Let's play 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.740
 it's not good 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:12.610

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.110
 Ok, I put music. Oh, God, he came, he came. 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.750
 he came. Oh 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.850

 The principal's key. Ah, very good. We may need these. Yes. We are doing very well. What is this soda? well. I am excited 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:44.260
 Why do we have this? Ok. Ok, our fourth notebook. What we do... 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.240
 Really great 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.280
 How do I know that I am fine. That phone can't hurt me. 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.040
 it is good. Hello, Mr. Phone. Oh, I have a message. 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.180
 * Let's play it* 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.160
 No, don't 

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.100
 Ah! You are doing numb... 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.800
 Come play~ Come play again... 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:17.100
 One day will go deep into your heart 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:24.219
 Ok, that's great, great, great, dear. Ok, let's see how you did it. 

00:06:24.219 --> 00:06:29.199
 This is a bully. Ok. I will not be close to the bully. This is for sure. 

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:36.968
 No, this is not the cleaning time, it has never been cleaned, and there is no cleaning time. 

00:06:39.349 --> 00:06:41.349
 No 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:50.588
 You can hear him close here. It’s finally mine. 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:59.220
 Ok, cool, oh, is this the place where we were born again? Shit, oh, this is a bit bad, he is the real bad guy. 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:05.340
 Do not!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.539
 What are you doing!? 

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:10.500
 This game is very annoying. 

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:12.980
 More annoying than PewDiePie. 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:14.120
 am I right? 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:20.700
 I am very ridiculously focused on defeating this stupid game. I know he is a stupid guy. 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:24.130
 I know this is a bit stupid for me. He is very good. It's ok 

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.400
 (cleaning time) 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:27.500
 Oh, Tiana. 

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:30.189
 Do not sweep. I don't want to sweep 

00:07:30.189 --> 00:07:31.820
 (GOTTA SWEEP SWEEP SWEEP0) 

00:07:31.820 --> 00:07:38.320
 God, what is that? I know this. So we still have to continue 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:43.300
 (GOTTA SWEEP SWEEP SWEEP) 

00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:46.880
 what the hell! 

00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:50.800
 Oh oh oh 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.100
 Come on! There are only two left! 

00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:04.360
 come on! 

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.060
 Oh, Tian, ​​he is super fast now. 

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:13.389
 I am doing very well, I know where the last one is. Why can't I hear him here? God 

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:17.800
 Oh~~ 

00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:21.600
 I am really scared. This is the room with the big broom! 

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:24.880
 Let's play, no, no. 

00:08:25.500 --> 00:08:26.300

00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:28.900
 3! 

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.900
 Come on, I am only one. 

00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.160
 Give me away. I know where it is. I know where it is. I know where it is. 

00:08:35.169 --> 00:08:36.860
 I know where it is. I know where it is. 

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:40.750
 It's somewhere here. It's somewhere here. No, no, here. right here. right here 

00:08:42.349 --> 00:08:43.100
 There 

00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:45.100

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:55.970
 Oh! 

00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:01.000
 Yeah! Thank you! (Congratulations! You found all seven notebooks!) 

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.200
 (What you need to do now is...) What is it talking about? ! 

00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.200
 Do you! You! Yes! Fast! Roll! 

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:08.380
 what should I do? ! 

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.950
 I did it 

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:16.059
 Ladies and gentlemen, I did it, right here. Ladies and gentlemen, we did it, everyone. 

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.000
 This is absolutely an illusion, I have nothing to do! 

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:27.300
 no no. No, no, no, no, no (no), no (no) 

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.960
 We definitely don't give up easily, Tian A. I don't know where the exit is.
