00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.300
 If you were in the 1970s during the Cold War, they wanted to know if someone had sent you 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:08.970
 intercontinental ballistic missile on your country, you had two choices: to send the satellite to space 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.660
 which at that time was very expensive, impractical, and you probably would not even have 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:16.179
 or build a radar system 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:21.210
 But the radar only sees the horizon, it will show you a rocket in flight, but at that moment 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.710
 whatever you notice, it may be too late. Do you need to know, 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.909
 that the rocket flies to you as soon as it's launched. You need a radar strong enough to get its signal from the ionosphere 

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:36.450
 it would be extended to thousands of miles, and still strong enough to be detected after it bounces back. 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.950
 You need a huge amount of energy and one of the largest radar systems ever built. 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.010
 You need something like this. 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.420
 Welcome - Duga-3 Radar System, Chernobyl 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.920
 This was known in the West as a Russian Woodpecker. After more than a decade accidentally 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.640
 jumped into shortwave radio bands, trying to find the best one to receive the received signal by transmitting 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.259
 repeating: rat-ttttt, which sounded like a bitch. It was so strong that 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:09.799
 countries around the world have filed official complaints about the Soviet Union, and 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:14.049
 there were also small groups called "The Russian Dating Club Love Club" or "Moscow Shock Absorbers" which displaced this signal 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:14.689
 from your radio 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.039
 There is another one, about sixty miles away. They work together in co-operation: one single sends and one accepts. 

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:24.530
 And it was necessary for it to be so big to get any result, so you could roughly - very 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.799
 roughly estimate where the rocket is headed. But the really brilliant thing is that every radar system 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.859
 similar to this one can see the difference between rocket and terrain. Because it is not 

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:38.420
 as you point the radar into the air: if you want to bounce the signal, then ground this signal 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.829
 will reflect the same as the rocket flying over it does. 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:43.979
 How do you know the difference? 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.049
 Doppler phenomenon. Just like the police siren approaching you is a few tones above, 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.909
 the radar signal reflected from the rocket will be at a higher frequency. And the missiles are 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:59.090
 they move at speeds measured in miles per second. So Duga did not get the signal at the same frequency, 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.549
 as his counterpart sent. He got a little higher. If it received such a received frequency so .. 

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:09.910
 Well, nothing like that happened. Fortunately. All this energy 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:16.310
 all this disturbance was useless. Surprisingly. No one ever fired a rocket. 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.500
 And somehow, in spite of all that was happening at the time, mankind went to health in the cold war.
