00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.689
 It’s really easy to do a whole bad website. 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:05.060
 Just need to write Code to write Infinite Loop 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.310
 One page will be endless 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.280
 The only reason why no one is arrogant, it’s really innocent. 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.700
 After many years, there are web pages. 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.789
 Intentionally or unintentionally 

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:17.960
 Crash B a Browser 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.490
 But today, today, the Web, I want to know more about Like and Share. 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.800
 Crash, a Browser, stirs you up. 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.429
 You are sharing 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.269
 It’s smart to be buried with the family. 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:33.780
 If you are doing Chrome, each tab is running independently. 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.329
 If someone writes an Infinite Loop, it will ring a page. 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.449
 There is only one Tab left dead. 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:41.670
 Everything else is as usual. Firefox is about the system, 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.989
 But the system will know that it is correct, after a few seconds. 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.750
 The canal will ask you that the system will stop the problem. 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.480
 You can avoid it. 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.510
 If you really have a bad heart, of course you have to 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.500
 But if you have a few lines, you can get bored with a few people, and when you follow a website, you will disappear silently. 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.570
 Mandatory is doing a good job, written in April 2015, 咗crashsafari.com 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.720
 But after a few months, no one went 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.830
 Someone posted Post a week ago on Hacker News 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.400
 Returning to my generous record, after a few days, 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.369
 It’s spread out to the Internet, and it’s finally smashed. 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.439
 I also talk about Click rate. 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.070
 Because as long as someone reports 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.740
 Others will think that the channel may be because of the story and someone clicks 嚟睇

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.920
 So I’ll pick up a title and add a few hundred words. 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.590
 No one will return to a source 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.140
 There are 啲 or even new words 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.500
 News! 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.220
 Do you know that a website will succeed? 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.020
 Because you will make Click to know what to do. It is a solution. 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.240
 Crash Safari, dot com. 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.409
 Crash Chrome dot com with Crash Firefox dot com 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.240
 Do the same thing 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.280
 I really want to break into it, is it a microphone? 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.689
 You can simply tweet Tweeter 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.560
 Send 俾 others. 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.000
 But there is another reason for this: iPhone, 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.049
佢唔 止 系 系 整 你 你 个 个 个 个 个 个

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:01.909
 Re-start your machine. 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.289
 In fact, you should be nervous. Safari, a ringing iPhone on the generous Browser 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:07.610
 Have the ability to defend against this web page 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.040
 If the channel sees too much memory, or has an Infinite Loop 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:13.090
 The channel is only Reload at most, or the Tab is extinguished. 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.640
 So you can write an Infinite Loop and make a page. 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.820
 You have to go out of a protection network 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.160
 Let the Browser itself have an accident 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.540
 A glimpse of the power of writing a software. 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.960
 So Crash Safari dot com is the Infinite Loop. 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.580
 I am scared by Code 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:39.540
 The first line has a Total string. Use to save a piece of text 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.730
 Just follow a line and click on a loop. 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:46.670
 That is to say, let’s talk about the block and make 100,000 times. 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.510
 Use i 嚟 as a Counter 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:51.730
 Then enter Loop 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.790
 Start with 0, then 1 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.650
 Always count to 100,000 - express with words 喎

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.090
 Reverberating to the back of total 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.690
 The number will increase 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.030
 Follow each time 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.510
 Will put a paragraph of text into the Browser history. 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.270
 Haiku’s push 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.610
 Because changing the history of Browser is a new story. 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.570
 A lot of it’s new 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.280
 Have not really considered the security issue 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.000
 Previously, if you went to only one Web App, it would be like Gmail 咁

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.830
 Back 掣 will have an accident 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.310
 You Click this email 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.370
 Email content appears on the same page 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.060
 Then logically, 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.460
 You can click Back to go back and forth. 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.430
 But the URL has not changed (repeating the same Page degree) 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.020
 Follow it and become a Gmail. 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.230
 Return to the previous website 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.610
 Haiku "pushState" - I want to solve this problem 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:47.070
 Web page words: "Hey 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.880
 The user only sounds the page, and the page is tight. 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.320
 When the channel Click Back 掣

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.040
 In fact, I want to go back to the previous page. 

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.290
 I will know if I return, I will stir up the channel. " 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.190
 But unlike the normal website, 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.390
啲pushState can be long 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.120
 And there is no problem with the system. 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.530
 A Browser will remember all the flaws. 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.470
 The canal will record the generous instructions of each page 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:12.210
 Join a history record. Remember a loop? 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:16.670
 Pages will lose 100,000 data into a historical record 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.370
 And each one is getting longer and longer: to the end 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.410
 Each piece of data has a length of half MB 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.220
 I have no good plans, but a rough estimate, 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.050
 All the difference is 25GB. 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.550
 But the iPhone has 1GB of RAM left. 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.430
 So die soon. 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.900
 Know that it is correct 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.090
 Reboot 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.570
 Should the microphone be checked for scary problems? of course! 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.180
 Will it sound a version of iOS? possible. 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.370
 In the worst case, if the conditions are right, 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.110
 A loophole can make a computer or a phone. 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.050
 Do any code, do anything. 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:02.810
 But it is too likely. Reluctantly, the last dead phone call was mischievous. 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.510
 How many people will there be? 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.450
 But related news can help you add a few more Clicks 

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:13.850
 Or the YouTube movie is just the same. Sor9ry. 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.800
