00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.605
 Computers are not good at choosing random numbers. 

00:00:02.605 --> 00:00:04.882
 Everything in a computer has been made to be predictable 

00:00:04.882 --> 00:00:06.530
 and follow logical patterns. 

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:07.602
 You enter the same numbers 

00:00:07.602 --> 00:00:09.445
 and gets the same numbers back. 

00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:11.318
 However, that is a problem because all modern encryption, 

00:00:11.318 --> 00:00:13.488
 including that lock in your browser 

00:00:13.488 --> 00:00:14.851
 that says you're safe, 

00:00:14.851 --> 00:00:18.163
 depends on large, actually random numbers. 

00:00:18.163 --> 00:00:20.303
 If you can predict those numbers in one way or another, 

00:00:20.303 --> 00:00:22.544
 then you can break those locks. 

00:00:22.544 --> 00:00:23.516
 That's why I am here, 

00:00:23.516 --> 00:00:26.449
 at the headquarters of Cloudflare, in San Francisco. 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:29.800
 Cloudflase is a service that protects websites and web services 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.740
 and before she sits as a sort of guard. 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:36.860
 About 10% of the internet goes through the Cloudflare network. 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.655
 Cloudflare was one of the first companies 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
 that offered free SSL encryption for websites. 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.860
 This ensures that the connection between your computer and the website you visit 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.500
 fully encrypted and can not be listened to. 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.220
 In short, they deal here with a lot of encrypted internet traffic, 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.800
 that's why they need a lot of random songs. 

00:00:55.815 --> 00:00:58.948
 It is possible to write code that simulates randomness, 

00:00:58.948 --> 00:01:00.862
 and that's good enough for a lot of situations, 

00:01:00.862 --> 00:01:03.563
 but theoretically, those numbers can be predicted. 

00:01:03.563 --> 00:01:05.507
 They are still generated by code, 

00:01:05.507 --> 00:01:08.020
 therefore, the servers here must have their randomness 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.720
 fetching an external and completely unpredictable source. 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.700
 A large amount of personal computers take the user as a source of randomness, 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.440
 small variations in the movement of a mouse, 

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.769
 the exact time between pressing keys, 

00:01:18.769 --> 00:01:21.957
 or on a telephone, for example, the speedometer or other sensors. 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.660
 In all these cases the big parts are omitted, 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.600
 the parts that can be influenced by people, 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.520
 and they look at the small details, 

00:01:29.524 --> 00:01:31.745
 the details that you can not precisely control, 

00:01:31.745 --> 00:01:33.365
 even if you would like it. 

00:01:33.365 --> 00:01:35.535
 But that kind of human interaction is not 

00:01:35.535 --> 00:01:37.711
 enough for a system on this scale, 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.860
 for this are these lava lamps. 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.540
 We film these lava lamps and take the photos and videos, 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.700
 and change it into a stream of random unpredictable data. 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.000
 And this unpredictable data is what we use to generate the keys 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.460
 encrypt the traffic that passes through the Cloudflare network. 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.460
 ~ NO KEY, BUT RANDOM DATES ~ This data is then put in our data centers 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.060
 ~ NO KEY, BUT RANDOM DATA ~ and then in a Linux kernel 

00:02:01.066 --> 00:02:04.072
 it then used to seed the number generators 

00:02:04.072 --> 00:02:05.661
 that are used to generate the keys. 

00:02:05.661 --> 00:02:07.700
 Every time you take a photo with a camera 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.820
 there is a kind of noise. 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.900
 So it's not just where the bubbles are in the lava lamp, 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.959
 it is the status of the air, the light in the room, 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.080
 every small change has a big impact on the flow of data. 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.200
 A cryptographic hash function is something we use 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.940
 where if you have a photo and changed a single bit, 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.958
 the entire flow of data changes. 

00:02:31.958 --> 00:02:35.207
 So we use that for randomness 

00:02:35.207 --> 00:02:36.479
 make great possible. 

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.750
 We also collect randomness in other places, 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.829
 We have one thing in our London office 

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:42.234
 what is called a chaotic pendulum. 

00:02:42.234 --> 00:02:44.717
 It consists of three arms and is unpredictable in it 

00:02:44.717 --> 00:02:47.145
 the way they run together. 

00:02:47.145 --> 00:02:50.060
 We film and carry it in our randomness source. 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.834
 In our office in Singapore we have a radioactive source 

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:55.679
 which we also use in our randomness system. 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:58.178
 It is not a kind of stunt we have performed, 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.080
 it is actually used in our real systems. 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.334
 Whether something in the world is actually random 

00:03:03.334 --> 00:03:06.241
 is arguably a question for philosophy and not science. 

00:03:06.241 --> 00:03:08.848
 Maybe everything is a complex clockwork. 

00:03:08.848 --> 00:03:11.308
 But these lava lamps are so chaotic 

00:03:11.308 --> 00:03:14.700
 that simulating the image on the camera with pixel perfect accuracy 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.740
 far enough forward to be useful 

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:19.700
 and find out what editing is done on the images, 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.180
 is about the same difficulty as brutality forcing in the first place. 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.157
 And even if you can simulate all that 

00:03:26.157 --> 00:03:28.483
 you would only have a piece in the puzzle. 

00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:30.159
 The people here are not the first to do this. 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:34.320
 "Lavarand" was patented by a company called Silicon Graphics in 1996, 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.020
 but that only lasted a few years. 

00:03:37.025 --> 00:03:38.797
 And of course there are less special and 

00:03:38.797 --> 00:03:40.868
 more practical ways to generate random numbers, 

00:03:40.868 --> 00:03:43.069
 but then I would not be here now. 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:44.609
 I would then go to another company that 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.200
 I know a lot, a camera focused on a basket of pussies. 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.100
 That would actually cost more maintenance.
