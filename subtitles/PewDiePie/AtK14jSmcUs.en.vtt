00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.279
 Evan and Tim for 50 ... I still have not laughed 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.380
 This question is a thousand dollars. Here's your first question: someone whose last name is "Obama" 

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.910
 Bin Laden 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.910
 Ummmam 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.910
 Curse 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.010
 It was hard for me not to laugh at this, I love how the other person does not bother himself and tries to answer 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.140
 It was like: Is this really your answer? 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.140
 Bin Laden 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.140
 Haha hahaha see him 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.610
 You laugh - I did not laugh. I did not laugh 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.610
 Baroudi's work tries to make a famous song and ride it on the national anthem of the Soviet Union 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.610
 * This is my translation * 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.610
 * Please pray for me if you like the translation * 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.960
 That song is beautiful 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.040
 It still sings strongly 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.620
 She looked stupid with her toes 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:43.560
 * Felix sings with the man * 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.520
 # Long Formed Sola # 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.680
 Nice 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.219
 When the coffin is placed in the ground they filled this song and not the discasito 

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:00.060
 #clap# 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.060
 That's right, all of me 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:05.790
 I am rich 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.790
 $ 12,000 from this video 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:16.550
 They took all the money because they were saving and even gave me a block because of intellectual property rights 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:24.860
 Thanks a lot to Sony and I want to salute YouTube who said 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.809
 We've looked at it, your YouTube partner will communicate with you for more details 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.800
 The only thing that gets me in my inbox is youtube videos that are blocked by companies that exploit your system 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.800
 #Cry# 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.620

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.460

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.220
 Fortnight is the most famous game in the world today 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.960
 125 million players worldwide and Oooo 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.520
 Thanks to the popularity of the game, EpicGames are busy making a game that follows Fortnight's success 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.550
 Okay 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.000
 They call it a sexual relationship (a heavy choy rip) 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.600
 It's part of the emotional relationship ... (Felix is ​​slow to read) 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.480
 And you can have a baby 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.480
 Well that's great 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.520
 Can a sexual relationship * Tackle his money meaning * Become famous as ..... 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.060
 Well okay this report is ridiculous 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:36.180

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.460
 What will replace the original image? * Mexican music in the background * 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.520
 Have not you got any ads, Dolan? Go away 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.880
 # They speak Mexican # * sorry I do not speak Mexican * 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:03.120
 * Beautiful Guitar Music * 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:17.820
 I know this sexual abnormality is nothing wrong but this is a sexual anomaly 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.160
 And we have our x3 diamond 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.960
 Why does Mainkraft play Kimstar: Why does everyone say stop? 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:34.070
 You stop using stone stones that can not extract diamonds. What do you mean by stopping? 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.900
 You need iron solutions Look at all .... * 

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.320

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.280
 La Lama Kimstar 

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.020
 Do not do this to me. You do not know how to play Minkraft? What? 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.560
 Everyone knows that it must be ironic 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:51.620
 You need stone solutions !!!!!! # Strong crying in the background # 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.260
 Hey guys, do you joke with me? 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:59.980
 * Mixed words * 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:02.560
 Because I weep real tears 

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:04.600
 And then hit a dog (I think metaphor I did not understand meaning) 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:11.060

 This is very sad Alexa does not do anything 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:29.060
 I do not have Alexa, but it's a good thing. 

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.840
 You can tell Alexa all the time that she 's so hilarious 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.380
 Can you bring milk and make sure to bring it from the last refrigerator 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.560
 Okay! 

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.020
 What is that!?!? * Warning and fold the speaker sound * 

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:49.780

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:53.080

 Nothing wrong Well nothing wrong * Avoiding angering his audience and the Western media * 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:34.680
 Nothing wrong I'm not saying that there is a mistake there are many (male members) in this anime 

00:06:34.929 --> 00:06:40.869

 We have finally been able to bring the shepherds it's the truth if you're a journalist and you had curiosity 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:25.380
 To see if this is real, go to Taco and ask them 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.920
 The sponsor is also McDonald's 

00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:37.380

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:39.480

00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.940
 this thing 

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:09.020
 What to get Why good sections in this week's episode of Felix! * I'm not sure it's just that 

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:15.520
 Sometimes we are lucky to this degree (I do not work, I just want to hit my head with a high-quality box), the man says in the video 

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:22.779
 This is the most video I can mention to myself in my whole life 

00:08:24.229 --> 00:08:31.779
 Why can not I hit my head with a chopper? It starts to stutter. What's happening to me? I am worried! 

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:34.740
 I'm nervous I can not speak 

00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:40.900
 Help me hate saying this but I feel like I was a ninja but I hate how (a famous Strimer named Ninja) 

00:08:41.599 --> 00:08:43.599
 He made me hate all the ninja 

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:48.430
 I thought the ninja were wonderful but I saw them not so good now 

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:57.060
 I just think I'm a guy who tries to look like a boy at the age of 12, was the ninja basically wonderful? 

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.840
 It is an existing property to be overridden by updates 

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.060
 It's a bug or a property I suspect .. 

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.380
 Servers restart themselves and your death is a property 

00:09:14.990 --> 00:09:19.689
 Looks great game, what a wonderful property This section has made me laugh hard What do you want? 

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:25.540
 I laughed, supposed to lose if I laughed at something supposed to just laugh at it! 

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:29.259
 Do not you understand this condition? Security Difficult you understand this condition? 

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.280
 Maybe I know it's a good thing that most of us died 

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:37.140
 Do you understand what i mean ? Will 

00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:40.180
 There will be no problem there is no ... 

00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:46.800
 There is no problem if you use a car that consumes a lot of fuel there are many people who do 

00:09:46.810 --> 00:09:49.989
 You must discover a way out of the herd before the time is late 

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.569
 It is not as difficult to take Bill Burr as one of the comedians 

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.380
 Very few 

00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:01.990
 Blessed be the Lord. Well, this was our theme for today 's episode. Who are you laughing? You are losing
