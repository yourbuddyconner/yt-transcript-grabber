00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.350
 Parents: The video mentions a very loud language. 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.950
 You would like to look at it before deciding if it is right for you and your children. 

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:12.139
 This is the beautiful South Yorkshire village of Penstone. 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:13.809
 "Pennystone" 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.289
 Probably before was the "village near the hill", but now it is ... 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:21.469
 e, is now an unfortunate name. And they know that. 

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:23.019
 Pennystone. 

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:24.529
 And yes, it sometimes causes problems, 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.230
 when a programmer decides to directly ban certain words 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.619
 without thinking where else they will come. Suddenly, 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.029
 you're not talking about Pennystone, 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.880
 you are talking about "P **** ton". 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.840
 And you might think no programmer will be so casual, 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.350
 but it has happened many times. There have been many incidents, 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.010
 through the history of the network, 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.590
 for people and towns with all sorts of strange names filtered or rejected. 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:50.890
 Best known as the Scandhrop problem, 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.539
 but I thought it was a better idea to shoot this in Penstone because, first, 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.399
 the joke is less rough and second, 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.119
 It makes no sense for someone to go to Scandhrop. 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.080
 No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.340
 These days, programmers usually use a more lenient approach. 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.200
 We have learned that people are creative. Endlessly creative. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.280
 Block words? We'll just add spaces or replace a letter with something that sounds almost the same. 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.630
 Try and block these and you will have problems when talking about duckweed. 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.240
 Try and scan them based on statistical methods 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.780
 and we will change and change through them. 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.450
 To block photos and videos ... well, luck. 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.520
 If you want to go through a web filter, 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.930
 just ask every classroom in each school. 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:49.730
 It takes only one person to know how to avoid it 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.530
 and suddenly each of their friends knows how. 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.060
 And all their friends. 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.110
 We are not just talking about wailing and adult content: 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.990
 Internet users in China often use euphemisms and tricks 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.930
 to shift social media censorship, 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.390
 calling it the highly censored anniversary of Tiananmen Square protests 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.600
 "Day of Internet Support" as everything around them is turned off. 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.700
 China's firewall works well, to some extent - 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.480
 but there is a great deal of damage. Unblocked. 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.990
 Other sites and words are swept and blocked as well 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.010
 And it takes a huge amount of human support to work. 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.900
 If you want to make an automatic system near the human level - 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.980
 and let's not forget that people tend to be wrong - 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.450
 the system must understand not only language but also context. 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.370
 You must understand every cultural reference, 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.530
 any insinuation that one can notice and block 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.240
 and you have to figure out what's safe, 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:49.740
 slightly overturning, or completely above the line. 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.380
 You need at least a simple theory of mind: 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.450
 the ability to judge what a person's reaction to a word or situation would be. 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.910
 To make an effective internet filter, you need a person, 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.690
 or computer equivalent to a person. 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.070
 I do not think it's impossible - 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.240
 but I think it's a long way. 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.100
 And if you have something that can understand people, 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.790
 to predict reactions and behavior, 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.249
 you have more than a web filter. 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:19.872
 Maybe you have something to some standards - 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.160
 like the old Turing test - counts as a man 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.140
