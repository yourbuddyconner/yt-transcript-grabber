00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
 I am at the Eurovision Song Festival final. 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.760
 That is the stage behind me. 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.200
 This is the huge B &amp; W Hallerne 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.760
 which is simply absolutely phenomenal. 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.600
 Photos, even on television, even with everything they have here 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.660
 can not describe the enormous size of this place. 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.300
 The final will take place in less than two hours 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.980
 on that stage here. 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.340
 My heart is with the UK, but let's be honest, 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.240
 it is likely to be Sweden or Austria. 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.240
 What is interesting. 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.300
 Because it will not care much this year. 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.100
 The odds of the gambling agencies go in all directions. 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.600
 There are many possible winners. 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.200
 And yes, it is possible that it becomes a draw. 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.200
 So how does Eurovision decide on a draw? 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.360
 The first line, if the number of points is the same, 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.300
 then it is about how many countries the two, or three 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.660
 or four people at the top gave a number of points. 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.900
 If that's the same, it's about how many gave them twelve points, 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:54.460
 the maximum. 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.300
 If that matches, then it goes to ten. 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.620
 And that happened once, in 1991. 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.500
 But if it keeps going, when it goes after eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, to the end, as 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.500
 two countries have exactly the same voice pattern, 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.160
 it goes to the first in the show. 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.620
 And there is a reason for that. 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.360
 It is 10 years since a song in the first half of the Eurovision Song Festival 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.700
 has actually won. 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.460
 Ten years. 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:25.260
 And in these years, the 16th, 17th and 18th place have won six times. 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.400
 This is partly because it is not a random draw. 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.220
 They draw for the first or second half. 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.440
 But then it's up to the producers: they put the good songs there. 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.320
 But it is also because, 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.900
 more people watch the later parts of the show, so more people will vote for these songs. 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.700
 As for Molly, of the United Kingdom, she is 26th today, 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.600
 could not be a good place, but, you can hope. 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.940
 Meanwhile, from the Eurovision Song Festival, and I can not believe I say so, 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.260
 that is something that you may not have known. See you on television in a few hours. 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.340
