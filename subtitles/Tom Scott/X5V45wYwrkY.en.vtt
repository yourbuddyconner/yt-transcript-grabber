00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.040
 I'm going to cross this street, 

00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:04.120
 and this is something you may not know: 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.780
 In England there are special crossing point for horses. 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.940
 Not surprising, because what I'm technical about is called 'bridleway'. 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.620
 It is a footpath that horse can use. 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.620
 So here we have a special button 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.620
 and there too 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:19.840
 so if you are already on your horse 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.840
 and special gathering place 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.140
 that I'm in this moment, 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.700
 where horses can wait 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.460
 before the lights change 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.840
 and cross the road in that direction. 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.100
 and here is the best: 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.540
 the best is the name, 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.280
 because in Great Britain we have Pelican crossings, "Pedestrian Light Controlled", 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.460
 the normal, 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.460
 And then they came with Toucan crossing, 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.460
 because they are for pedestrians and cyclists 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.180
 so "two-can" (two can) cross. 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.780
 Then you came with Puffin crossings 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.480
 And I do not know how to 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.480
 but those are those with special cameras in lights, 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.460
 like that 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.460
 that pedestrians follow when they cross, 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.460
 so that the traffic light can turn green, as quickly as possible. 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.280
 And then, because everything is named after occurring things: 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.640
 do we have this, 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.280
 a Pagasus crossing. 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.120
 And that is something that you may not know. 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.780
