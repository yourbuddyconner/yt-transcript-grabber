 He knows what you did five minutes ago. Ignite London, applause for Mr. Tom Scott! 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.350
 [APPLAUSE] Thank you. 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:16.350
 So, hello, I'm Tom. Short poll: who is not active here, does not have an account, on Facebook, Twitter, 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:17.659
 on LinkedIn, on any other social network. Somebody? 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:21.329
 There's a few hands up, OK. 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:26.369
 Who has everything on public? You have your medical information on Twitter and you 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.909
 post everything. Somebody? 

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:30.349
 A couple there. Everyone who falls into those categories: enjoy the ride! 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.940
 All others, little warning. This retrieves live data from the internet. It can contain offensive things, 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.980
 sorry if that is the case. 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.550
 Also, if people show their personal information, do not take photos or videos of it, I will 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.390
 hide everything in the video before it appears. 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.559
 So, let's start with Twitter. It is Social Media Week, so let's start here. 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.370
 Twitter has binary privacy settings, which is very interesting, because the Press Complaints 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.570
 Commission has said this morning that if you put your Twitter account on public, all 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.320
 tweets may be used by journalists. 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:05.320
 So if you've tweeted that you hate your boss, like all these people in the last hour ... 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.890
 You might ... it does not basically take the bitter ex-test. Can someone you 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.620
 do you hate to confront this information? 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.940
 Let's talk about Foursquare. Most people here will have read PleaseRobMe.com, which keeps track of 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.930
 when people leave their home. But you can find out when people are at home and 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.540
 where that is 'at home'? Well, yes, if they made two mistakes: one, link Twitter to Foursquare, 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.130
 and two, check in at your own home. 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.200
 [GELACH] Almost all of these locations have Google Street View information, so in 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.360
 In this case you can even inspect the place before you get there, and to make that worse: you know all these people 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.120
 smartphones. 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.250
 So, let's talk about Youtube. Youtube has privacy settings, but no one uses them. There is "private" 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.180
 and "hidden". But what people usually do is upload their video with no tags and name. 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:58.510
 However, it is still tagged with the filename, so if you search for, say, DSC_2432.MOV, then 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:01:59.500
 do you think this kind of thing. 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.180
 I have no idea what is behind me on the screen. These are nine completely random videos 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.229
 without context. People their children and talking people. That's a bit of the internet, 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.780
 or at least a piece of the world that has broadband internet access and video cameras. 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.830
 Wikipedia is interesting. Anonymous users leave traces behind. You know this - if you edit Wikipedia, 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.670
 then your IP address will appear. Interestingly enough, so is your proxy address. So here are 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.610
 the four most recent interesting changes from the Houses of Parliament. 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.610
 [GELACH] Anne Main and Mark Harper are both members of parliament ... [APPLAUSE] ... but it is convenient to mention 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.940
 that because these are from the Houses of Parliament it does not mean that the 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:43.450
 MPs have made the changes. May everyone have been. 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.790
 Now you will notice that I have avoided the hot hangar so far, namely Facebook. Facebook has 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.650
 actually fine privacy setting, regardless of what everyone thinks of it. And security: they 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.680
 SMS a one-time password, in case you do not trust the computer you log into. 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.120
 Unless you have him on public. And many people do not realize what 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.459
 "public" means. Example: Here are 200 people who have everything on public 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:09.100
 their Facebook profile. Do they know this? Some of them. Many do not. So this is 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:14.200
 where it can go very wrong. Let's choose one of these people. 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.310
 And it has gone very wrong. [CENSORED] here. His profile photo is a photograph of a ... tree, 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.069
 I think. That is interesting. I never met him, I have no idea who he is, he is chosen 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.260
 through the computer. Well, let's look at his profile. 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.459
 Facebook is blocking my automatic program from obtaining more information, but that stops 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.400
 I do not just log in and look at his profile. So, let's take a quick look 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.550
 He is a tree carer, that explains the photos, he studied at the [CENSORED] College, he comes from [CENSORED], 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:45.040
 he was born on 14 December 19 [CENSORED], which means that it was a ... Friday. [LAUGHTER] 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:46.230
 His father looks terrifying. Oh! And Jane [CENSORED] is his aunt, which means [CENSORED] 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.599
 probably his mother's maiden name is. 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:53.239
 Do you already feel a bit weird about this? Here are a few of his recent thoughts. "Fernando Torres", he is 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:04:00.239
 probably a Chelsea fan. Well, here is a thing, the system would 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.430
 have to have removed one message from its timeline and placed it here. 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.430
 [PUBLIC: OOH!] 075 [CENSORED] 0, this almost certainly goes directly to the voicemail, but let's 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.280
 call him ... [APPLAUSE] 

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:18.280
 "Welcome to the O2 messaging service ... the number you are trying to reach is not available ..." 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:36.509
 Hey! I leave a message for [CENSORED]. I am currently on the podium in London 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:48.400
 a few hundred people, give us an applause ... 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.169
 [LOUD APPLAUSE] 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:53.789
 I check it for a moment, this is [CENSORED], who is a tree caretaker, Chelsea fan, and [CENSORED]. 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:56.779
 That you know, you may need to secure your Facebook profile and check your security settings. 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:02.589
 And you're probably born on a Friday and I think your mother's maiden name is [CENSORED]. 

00:05:02.589 --> 00:05:02.849
 [APPLAUSE AND GEJUICH] 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.150
 I hope you had a nice evening. My name is Tom Scott, good evening. 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.640
