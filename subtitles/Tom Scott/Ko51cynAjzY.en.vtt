00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.320
 This is the Camberwell Submarine. 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.580
 It is not really a submarine, it is a heat boiler and exhaust for most houses here, 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.980
 but it is the closest I can find to a 'submarine' to which I have access. 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.200
 So here, I would like to tell you something about something you may not have known. 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.260
 which is 'the letter of the last resort'. 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.440
 The United Kingdom has four Trident-Class Nuclear 'submarines'. 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.340
 They are our most important nuclear deterrent. 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.760
 We are one of the few countries that have Nuclear Capability. The thing with nuclear war is, 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.120
 is that it is monumental stupid. It involves the death of everyone involved, 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.880
 and inexplicably many deaths from civilians. So the thing is ... 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.260
 if you were the Prime Minister, and you knew that missiles would be launched to the United Kingdom 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.700
 and you have four minutes to respond - as was possible during the 80's. 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.680
 What would you do? 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.940
 Are you launching them? Send you your own response, 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.880
 knowing that the only thing it yields, knowing that it can not stop the incoming missiles, 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.860
 the only thing that delivers it is killing more innocent civilians. 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.540
 Do you launch them, do you take a vengeful blow that you have always threatened with? Or... 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.140
 do you accept that all this you can do at this point is kill more people and not launch them? 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.860
 And more important... 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.060
 What if the Prime Minister is already dead? 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.880
 What if the sub-commander is already dead? 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.600
 What if the attack has already hit, and nothing has gone to the British Nuclear 'submarines'? 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.040
 Different armies around the world have different ways to deal with this, and the British way of dealing with it 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.720
 is just ... almost a Poetic way of doing it. 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.360
 In every British 'submarine', in a safe, 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:44.600
 in another safe, is one of the four letters, all identical and handwritten by the Prime Minister. 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.840
 And every Prime Minister who comes to power now, even David Cameron, 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.880
 one of their first tasks is to sit down and write these letters by hand. 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.120
 who say to the commander of every Nuclear 'submarine', if everything went wrong, if Great Britain is destroyed, 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.620
 if the minister president is dead, if everyone in the chain of command is dead, and you can not do anything else ... 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.920
 ... are you launching? 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.900
 And if ade 'submarine' moves on and finds that Great Britain is destroyed 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.460
 and one of the tests they use is whether Radio 4 is still broadcasting ... 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.000
 apparently ... 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.600
 they look in the safe. 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.820
 They open the envelope, they look at the letter, and they tell them 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.180
 countless people have to kill as a last resort. 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.680
 or that they go to the nearest friendly port, and do what they can to rebuild. 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.700
 And that is the case with nuclear war, once it starts, the situation is no longer predictable. 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.780
 You can give up so well, because the idea was never to launch ... 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.820
 ... it was always to be scared. 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.880
 And that is something you may not have known.
