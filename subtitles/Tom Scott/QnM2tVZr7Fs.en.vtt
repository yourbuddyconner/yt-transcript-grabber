00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:03.480
 Up there is the bridge at Kapitan Kebnikov, 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.991
 the Russian icebreaker taking me 

00:00:04.991 --> 00:00:08.640
 and the rest of Chris Hadfield's expedition around the Arctic 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.310
 Nowadays, navigation is up there and on, well, 

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.070
 most ships are largely automatic 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.090
 It is handled by GPS and computer driven charts 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:19.300
 But tucked away on the bridge is an additional safety device 

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.730
 which is pretty much the same as the adventurer has used for centuries. 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.160
 It is a sextant and it is used for astronomical navigation. 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.820
 You get the angle between the horizon and a known star, even the sun, 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.000
 at least when it is not overcast 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.010
 consult a lookup table and use a bit of math, 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.030
 and you have your latitude. 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.220
 Now a hundred years ago when a sexist was the only way to navigate 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.700
 the claims of the adventurer had to be taken from the records they held. 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.440
 or just on faith. 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.440
 Even to today 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.940
 is no one sure who came first to the North Pole 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.340
 Frederick Cook claimed to have reached it in 1908, 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.760
 but his records are not entirely up, 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.462
 and his evidence was questioned, especially by a man 

00:00:58.462 --> 00:01:03.860
 who claimed to have reached the North Pole a year later: Robert Peary. 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.330
 By most stories, Peary was a very unpleasant man, 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.570
 but for many years he was commonly considered to have led 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.980
 the first expedition that actually reached the geographic North Pole in 1909. 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.080
 There is a memorial for him on a ridge at Cape York in Greenland, 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.799
 though, it was, of course, placed by his widow. 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:23.840
 But he was the only one 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.920
 on the last part of his expedition trained in navigation, 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.380
 the only one who knew how to use a sextant 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.560
 and all his claims are false in the light of the hindsight 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.200
 He reached with garenti - whoa - not the North Pole 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.670
 And then there was US naval officer Richard Byrd and his pilot, Floyd Bennett, 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.420
 who posted to have flown over the North Pole 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.549
 but there were also some gaps in his data 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.220
 a lot of over precise sexually-based results that could not be right. 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.880
 Even the creators of their aircraft said they were unlikely to have done so. 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.080
 And it's not like any of them could leave a flag or a marker. 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.910
 The northern polar pakis, the thick ice, 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:58.560
 not the thin ice we go through right now, the thick ice, 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.909
 still flowing just around the Arctic Ocean 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.220
 and it drives back and forth. 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.640
 Roald Amundsen led the first expedition that provided compelling documentation 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.909
 that they reached the North Pole, with airship. 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.969
 But they didn't land there, they just flew over it: 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:17.329
 It was after World War II, in 1948, when a Soviet expedition 

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:23.219
 finally set foot on the exact geographic North Pole, after being flown there. 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:26.110
 Other explorers reached the North Pole over the pack ice, with air support, 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.099
 but the first confirmed surface expedition to the North Pole without new supplies: 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.340
 It took until 1986 when Will Steger after several trials, 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.359
 Finally, something that most people considered was achieved 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:42.549
 something some Edwardian explorers had accomplished decades earlier. 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.829
 Today, if you have enough money, you can fly to the North Pole, 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:47.959
 or you can take a nuclear powered icebreaker, 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.949
 you can check your GPS to confirm it 

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:52.730
 And you can send a selfie back via satellite phone. 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.150
 We do not want so far north aboard this ship, 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.090
 And we don't have a nuclear reactor to give us enough power 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.189
 to get through the thick ice up at the North Pole. 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.359
 But if all the smart technology on that bridge fails, 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:08.980
 We can still use the same technique as all the adventurers used centuries ago 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.010
 and track our position with the stars. 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:13.099
 At least where we can see them. 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:16.139
 I'm on this trip because of Chris Hadfield's Generator Arctic, 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.139
 and this man is as well! 

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:21.620
 My name is Ben Brown and I'm lucky to be here right now! 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.620
 Check out his videos 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.252
 he provided the amazing drone pictures for this, 

00:03:24.252 --> 00:03:26.950

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.819
 -- Thanks! -- It is okay!
