00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.960
 In the mid-nineteenth century, London faced a problem: 

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.180
 There were too many deaths, 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.520
 but not enough places to bury it. 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:11.760
 Seems of recently deceased persons had to be dug up and scattered ... 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:15.120
 so that more people could be put into the ground. 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.220
 And that was of course a huge health risk, 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.380
 that contributed to cholera epidemics ... 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.540
 and this caused more deaths. 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.220
 That is why two industrialists came up with a daring plan: 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.860
 They lay about forty kilometers outside of London, at Brookwood, the largest cemetery in Europe. 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.760
 And they let trains run from there to here ... 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.520
 to this end point in Waterloo ... 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.440
 and it became the London Necropolis Railway. 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.760
 There were funerals of the first class, 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.120
 second class, and of the third class ... 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.680
 which at least guaranteed you a cemetery, 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.840
 much better than the mass graves that London was using at the time ... 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.020
 for the dead who could not afford anything better. 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.600
 And here is the amazing part, the thing you might not know: 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.660
 It worked! 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.440
 The London Necropolis Railway continued to exist for almost a century. 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.700
 The first train drove in 1854, 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.040
 and although the car became more popular and this train was running less 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:12.180
 in the twentieth century, 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.020
 he continued to ride until the Second World War. 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.320
 The only obstacle that stopped the railway was the bombing 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.940
 on this railway line and the entire area during the Blitz. 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.840
 If those rails had not been inflated, we would, theoretically speaking, 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.700
 still see twenty-first-century death trains to Brookwood. 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.700
 And that is something you may not have known. 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.840
