00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
 The reason why I am "sexy vegan" on my face and chest 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.860
 Because both are good things 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.280
 I want the public to know who I am when I see him. 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:09.280
 Wait... wait... wait... wait a minute 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.540
 As far as your logic is concerned, you may also have a "crazy" on your face. 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.720
 Because you are a madman 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:20.260
 Hello everyone, my name is... 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.420
 We are going to talk about the best YouTuber in history today. 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.780
 No, I am not saying that I am talking about 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.440
 Sexy Vegan (Sexy Vegan) 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.840
 He has a blue hair 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.960
 Blue eyebrows because blue is my favorite color 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.020
 My mom... she doesn't like the tattoos on my face. 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.100
 He tattooed his face 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.480
 My mom... she doesn't like the tattoos on my face. 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.700
 Looks like a freak 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.000
 He is ready 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.320
 The reason why I am "sexy vegan" on my face and chest 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.020
 Because both are good things 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:52.620
 I want the public to know who I am when I see him. 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.760
 The tears here represent that I am suffering 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.660
 The Avengers "sexy vegan" 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.520
 First of all, that is the worst and most asymmetrical star I have ever seen. 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.880
 It seems that a 5-year-old child is better than him. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.120
 Are those tattoos his own?? Like... 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.500
 The stars represent the superstars I want to be and for fun. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.140
 And for fun 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.920
 That represents the superstar I want to be 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.000
 And also for fun 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.020
 My mom... she doesn't like the tattoo on my face because it looks like a freak 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.140
 what?! 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.440
 How dare you dare to say that? 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.380
 Please allow me to say that you are very good with blue and I also love blue. 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.760
 Obviously, that is the best color 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.460
 Finally, someone is brave enough to talk about these issues, stupid mother. 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.860
 Don't let me dance naked in the street 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.000
 There are some movie stars like Tom Cruise but I now have tattoos on my face. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.480
 I am more unique, I want to be myself. 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.000
 People must like me like this 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.140
 That's the way it is 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.320
 I don't want to follow them. 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.300
 My God, he is me at all. 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.520
 He is simply an exaggerated version of my existence. 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.540
 Raquel says her brother is "sexy" 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:13.880
 It is forbidden to upload things on YouTube and Craigslist for life (Note: Craigslist Craig List: for advertising sites) 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.200
 And he thinks his existence is equal to God. 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.900
 Wait... Dr. Phil is talking about me now? What is going on?? This is... 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.200
 OK, so "Sexy vegan" has a YouTube channel 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.880
 Obviously, if you upload a video to YouTube, you can be considered a YouTuber. 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.720
 I just got super-level angry 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.080
 Because I was just a little embarrassed but not very exaggerated, so... 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.800
 Hey, welcome to see my newly uploaded Vlog. 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.560
 I just just got super-level angry. 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.960
 Obviously we have to learn how to use Youtube properly in the "sexy vegan" 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.780
 He chose to shoot the wrong ratio of videos 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.320
 People just don’t dare to do these bold things like him. 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.600
 He is not a person who conforms to the masses. 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.460
 He is the most typical youtuber ever. 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.080
 He even tattooed his face 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.020
 How can we not discuss his eyebrows!! 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.560
 Solemnly declare that I don’t call my brother "sexy", I call him "SV" 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:17.160
 Just like... 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:17.900
 and many more... 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:20.640
 What is "SV"?? 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.880
 A shorthand for "the vaginal vagina" (Note: Auntie in the South Park has sand in the vagina of a certain group) 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.280
 Damn! She is really jealous! 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.580
 Last year my brother looked like this guy. 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.260
 But when I saw his recent shift 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.220
 He is the dog's shape... 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.620
 I describe my brother as a lazy, unmotivated madman. 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.140
 He is a hazard to the public 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.700
 Damn! This clip is really stressful 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.220
 Have you heard of pewdiepie? 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:50.260
 He is a hazard to all races 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.000
 My mom has two rules for my brother. 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.560
 Don't be caught 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.560
 Don't take drugs 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.440
 He does not see any compliance with any regulations. 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.560
 I feel everyone knows that some people like this are to some extent 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.120
 This child is just spoiled, so I started to make problems. 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:08.060
 But no one wants to solve it, so just give him whatever he wants. 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.640
 Finally, let him become such a monster 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.980
 Awesome! 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:14.260
 I love this, I rely on this life. 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.900
 So... "Sexy vegan" or Hanz DeBartolo also wrote a book called... 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.320
 Before his transition 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.960
 Called... "Fargo Lefty's Adventure" 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.100
 Meeting Fargo Lefty...Fargo is a handsome young vegan writer about 25 years old 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:33.900
 From a wealthy family, he still lives in the house his father bought for him. 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.720
 Fargo has some cool vegan friends 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.400
 One of them is a rich drug dealer... 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.480
 Honestly, I want to finish reading it a bit. 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.180
 My name is "Sexy vegan". I really changed my name to "Sexy vegan". 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.040
 The name Hanz is no longer suitable for me. 

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.960
 I think this is really a good move to change your name to "sexy vegan" 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:55.000
 Especially... stab it on your face 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.000
 Especially if you have not changed your identity 3 to 4 times in the past 3 years 

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.860
 From Hanz DeBartolo... 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.260
 To "vegan Hanz" 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:08.160
 Then go to "Sexy Authentic Little Justin Charlie Sheen Project" (Note: Charlie Sheen is an American actor) 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.000
 Seriously, you can find all the changes on the Internet, all there. 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.320
 That is the saddest thing I have ever seen. 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.560
 But also super funny 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.300
 But also... super funny XDDD 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.800
 Sorry... 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.220
 I used to lose only 1.3% body fat. 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:27.460
 "Beautiful vegan ~ Messiah ~~" 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.840
 Everyone stares at me when I am out. 

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.240
 Because I wear speedo style swimming trunks (speedo: swimwear brand) 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.580
 I am super exotic like a "Sapphire Kenney SV" 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:37.500
 I like to walk around in swimming trunks. 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.520
 Because wearing clothes on me is like putting a car cover on the sapphire 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.300
 This is totally illogical, so I am so angry every time. 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:47.820
 People don't want to see my nakedness. This is totally unreasonable. 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.470
 Because why people don’t see Sapphire Kenny... 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:52.460
 My logic is 100% flawless 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.340
 I am so angry every time 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.660
 When I went to the grocery store, I was very annoyed with the guards behind. 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:01.960
 What is this line?! 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.220
 I have seen many of his videos. 

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.000
 His speech is a lot worse than here. 

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.840
 (angry) I am so angry every time (angry) 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:12.940
 It’s like the producer called him "Hey! Can you speak more angry?" 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.020
 If I wear swimming trunks, the guard will say: Mr. You need to wear a little more. 

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.500
 I will be like: "But the hot girl can wear it like this" 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.840
 Hold apologize... sorry, sorry, sexy vegan 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.740
 Your logic is always flawless 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.740
 I am not interested in targeting you. 

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:31.380
 But I don’t think women can wear them like that. 

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:33.340
 That is what those "normal people" would say. 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.960
 Finally, there is a brave person like "sexy vegan" 

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.400
 Don't be afraid to tell some controversial issues like... 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.340
 ...sex discrimination and how much it is not good for women 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.680
 It is also not good for men, ok? 

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:50.260
 Why girls can go around 

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.640
 Let the teat out 

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.180
 But men can't?! 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:55.720
 This is completely in the ghost! 

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:58.660
 I was kicked out by too many stores. 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.000
 I was arrested 15 times. 

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.100
 15??!! 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:03.760
 Damn! 

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:06.800
 !@#$ damn! 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:08.440
 I have a lot of talents. 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:10.500
 I have several Youtube videos. 

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.520
 I was also kicked out by the Youtube channel. 

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.500
 Let the channel be terminated because of excessive pornography 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.900
 Do you want to know what he is eating? 

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:23.220
 He made a film, this is the most objectionable thing. 

00:07:23.220 --> 00:07:25.380
 He likes these fake fish cakes. 

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.380
 Plus vegan beauty (vegenaise) 

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.920
 But to be fair, vegan melon is actually delicious, ok? 

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:33.220
 If you haven't tried it, don't reject it, but, dude... 

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:35.640
 Vegan melon... vegan cannabis is very delicious 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.180
 Just as good as normal cannabis 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:40.000
 Damn, I actually agree with what he said. 

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:46.960
 All he eats is crispy chicken and fish fillets. 

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.680
 He didn't even cook them but just microwave 

00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.320
 Why do I have to care about other people's diets? 

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:55.820
 The main problem is self-mother 

00:07:55.820 --> 00:07:58.600
 She doesn't believe me, she is also very pessimistic 

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.440
 You get the focus, sexy vegan 

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.680
 He had problems with his mother and his family, so he went to Dr. Phil. 

00:08:03.820 --> 00:08:08.340
 He finally appeared in Dr. Phil and this is the result 

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:14.620
 "I am ~ beautiful vegan ~ Messiah ~~" 

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:19.700
 This is a song, I didn't say that I am... She also knows (silence) 

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.540
 I am like my dad, ok? 

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.320
 10 expensive cars, my dad told me 

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.500
 I have the same name as him until I change my name. 

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:30.360
 My mom doesn't bail me, even if she knows that I am innocent. 

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:33.920
 What is he saying??!! 

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.180
 Let me say... 

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.680
 This is not a song... 

00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.280
 My dad has the same name. 

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.520
 He has 10 cars 

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.500
 Then my mom didn’t bail me out of prison. 

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:48.240
 I am liberating more than 7 billion... pigs, their cages are so small that they can’t move for years. 

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.320
 Okay? 

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:53.860
 I work... my mom is an anti-social scum. 

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.680
 I have the highest record of Hot or Not (Note: a website that votes for photos) 

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.460
 After 327 women rated me, I got 9.9 out of 10 

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:04.000
 - Come see your talents, your talents? You are ugly and blame-3 hundred... Wow, that is a lot of women. 

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.420
 Ok, stop! Hey! Hey! Look at me! 

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.680
 What is he doing?! Shaking his ass to Dr. Phil?! 

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.720
 - After 327 women rated me, I got 9.9 points out of 10 - Hey! Stop! Hey! Hey! Look at me! 

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:15.500
 Come see your talents, your talents? 

00:09:15.500 --> 00:09:17.480
 What is your talent? Hey? Hey? 

00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:20.060
 What talent do you have, Dr. Phil? 

00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.160
 You are swearing in front of my audience, so I have to ask you to go out. 

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:24.840
 The audience, I apologize to you. 

00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:28.140
 - It was a naive and immature behavior - great!! 

00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:31.220
 - And... - So I have to go?? - Yes. 

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:34.360
 - I don't want - don't let the door hit your ass. 

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:36.880
 Oh my God!!!!!!!!! 

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:40.680
 Really! I don’t know that Dr. Phil is also very embarrassing. 

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.320
 Then a few months passed 

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:46.200
 He went back to apologize to Dr. Phil. 

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:47.740
 For his crimes... 

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:49.900
 That is, jumping on the stage 

00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.200
 My performance at Dr. Phil is totally a disaster. 

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:55.460
 I lost a chance that my performance was wrong. 

00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:58.300
 My mom is an anti-social scum. 

00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.900
 My biggest regret is yelling at Dr. Phil. 

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.300
 - You look at me! - Yes, I agree. 

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.520
 If I have those face tattoos... 

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:12.860
 My biggest regret is definitely yelling at Dr. Phil. 

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.800
 That will... I fully understand why that is your biggest regret 

00:10:17.020 --> 00:10:19.540
 100% understand not because your face is tattooed 

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:23.180
 It’s definitely 100 times worse for Dr. Phil’s yelling. 

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:23.980
 Ok? 

00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:25.920
 So I am very happy that we have a consensus. 

00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.100
 I am worried that he did not realize this. 

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.980
 I hate to see my own voice to my mom. 

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.600
 I let my mom down 

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.320
 I don't respect anyone, I used to be a (mute) 

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:36.320
 "I~~~It was a (muffler)~~" 

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.120
 "I said different strokes for different folks" (probably meaning: different people have different behavior patterns) 

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:44.080
 One of my songs was inspired by Dr. Phil's "different strokes for different folks" 

00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.180
 "different strokes for different folks" 

00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:47.620
 He said on the show... 

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:50.100
 Oh, really? It’s an original song. 

00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:51.580
 He is really me, right? 

00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:52.680
 He is just plagiarizing 

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:56.300
 "The answer is that everyone is different" 

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.680
 "Do what you want, as long as you don't hurt anyone." 

00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.940
 "There are animals and insects" 

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:04.540
 - I am really sorry - how recently, dude 

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:07.780
 - I really appreciate it, you are so good, can forgive me, invite me back - it doesn't matter 

00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:10.220
 - Please sit down - thank you, sir - I am very glad that you are back. 

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:12.980
 So we don’t need to look at other clips to know 

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:17.440
 Dr. Phil is like "If you care about animal issues, I also love animals." 

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.860
 "So this means you are actually not that bad" 

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.260
 With this intention, it means that you are a good person. 

00:11:22.620 --> 00:11:24.580
 At the center of your soul 

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:26.860
 So I said... you know absolutely... 

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.000
 You should check out the "Sexy vegan" Youtube channel. 

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.420
 He definitely needs more subscribers 

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.880
 Because I think he is not arrogant enough 

00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:38.260
 Allow him to profit from followers on more social networking sites 

00:11:38.380 --> 00:11:40.980
 I think it is definitely the best thing for him now. 

00:11:40.980 --> 00:11:44.040
 Instead of seeking psychiatric assistance 

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:47.340
 From an "expert" for example, like Dr. Phil 

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:48.540
 Anyway, it’s like this to me. 

00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:49.900
 If you like this movie, please like it. 

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.200
 Then remember to... 

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.400
 Be a sexy vegan 

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:54.860
 Just like me 

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:57.460
 What the end of this fuck?! 

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:58.680
 Oh my god... 

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.040
