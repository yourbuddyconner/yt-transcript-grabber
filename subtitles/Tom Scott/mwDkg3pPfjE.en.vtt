00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.070
 I am in Morocco! 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:07.359
 Well, not really. I'm actually in Disney's version of Morocco, in EPCOT - 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:13.500
 - the reason why this specific alley has an emergency exit. 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.160
 And here's something you might not know, and it has to do with ... 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.779
 ice. 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:23.439
 Look, I'm in America. And in America, this ice must contain milk. 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.220
 Real milk. To be precise, a certain percentage of milk fat. 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.939
 But if I was in Great Britain, it is not always the case 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.270
 Look, British ice cream, unless it has the sense "dairy" on it, 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.730
 it can also be made of something called "Bleached deodorized, hydrogenated vegetable oil". 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.829
 Which means the stuff you get from ice cream trucks 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.260
 and the cheap stuff that you get in the supermarkets 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.610
 should not contain milk. 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.520
 This, on the other hand, is American ice cream, 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.359
 which means that I can be sure - or at least reasonably certain - 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:53.590
 that it is made with milk. 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.880
 And that is something that you may not have known yet. 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.720
