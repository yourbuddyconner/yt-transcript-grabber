00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.530
 The guest video of today is from Grady of Practical Engineering 

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.540
 He talks about a tragedy 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.250
 and the lesson we learned from it, and the reason why it is fascinating that it happened 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.660
 In addition, he has also made his own model. 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.950
 Grady. Go ahead! 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.710
 In the summer of 1981, the Hyatt Regency Hotel in Kansas City, Missouri, [United States], 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.450
 a big party in an atrium space of several floors. 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:22.450
 During this event 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.640
 collapsed the hanging walkways on the second and fourth floor. 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.550
 where more than 100 people died, and another 200 people were injured. 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.280
 When it happened, it was the worst structural accident in US history. 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.600
 In the aftermath of the disaster 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.980
 researchers discovered a change in the original design of the walkways 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.480
 it had been proposed by the manufacturer and had been accepted by mistake by the structural engineer. 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.870
 What at first glance seems to be a subtle adaptation to the design, 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.379
 turned out to be the cause of the collapse. 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.879
 Two hanging walkways hung in the atrium of the Hyatt Regency 

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.539
 with the suspension bridge on the second floor directly under the suspension bridge on the fourth floor. 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.260
 Both were supported by a set of box girders 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.580
 held up by wire rods, and secured with nuts and washers. 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.950
 The original design required a single pair of wire rods 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.830
 that went through the box girder of the fourth floor to the box girder of the second. 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.810
 The manufacturer responsible for making the walkways did not agree with the plan 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.369
 because there was then need of thread thread along the entire length of the wire rods, 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:29.930
 something that could easily be damaged during construction. 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:34.220
 So, he suggested dividing the wire rods into two sets. 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.979
 One to connect the walkway on the fourth floor with the roof, 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:42.110
 and one to connect the walkway on the second floor to the box girders of the fourth floor. 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.820
 If you do not notice the significance of this change, then you are not the only one. 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.380
 It was assumed by the engineer, without proper checking, or calculations, 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.189
 something that would have revealed its inherent error. 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.110
 In this arrangement, what the original design must represent, 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.110
 the weight of the walkways is transferred independently to the wire rods. 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.490
 Notice how I can move both box beams without influencing the others 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.680
 Now look at the changed design. 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.510
 In this arrangement, 

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:13.520
 see that the entire weight of the walkway is carried on the second floor 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.780
 not through the wire rods 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.640
 but instead, through the box bar above it. 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.860
 If I raise the bridge of the fourth floor, the walkway of the second floor is also lifted. 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.270
 The threaded rods at the top still carry the same weight, 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.830
 but the nuts of the upper box beam, lifting the weight of both walkways. 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:38.020
 This simple adjustment has effectively doubled the load on the nuts. 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.150
 Imagine that you and your friend both hang on a rope. 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.220
 The original design would be equal to that you both, independently, hold the rope 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.760
 while in the changed design it would be the same as your friend who is holding on to your ankles. 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.160
 The total weight dar is borne by the rope is the same in both cases, 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.300
 but the chance that you can keep your grip is not. 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:04.480
 This subtle change was identified by researchers as the main reason for the collapse. 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.970
 With so many men on the walkway that evening 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.710
 the burden on the connections was too much 

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:13.570
 The box girders tore open and slid over the nuts and washers 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.950
 Which caused both walkways to collapse. 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.020
 There is an implicit handshake between a society and its engineers. 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.150
 We have virtually no choice but to trust that the environment in which we live 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.420
 is safe 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.080
 When an engineer accepts a design, 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:36.120
 he or she assumes responsibility for accuracy and safety for the general public. 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.090
 But making mistakes is human, and that includes engineers. 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.320
 So we try to develop similarities and processes 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:46.730
 that can correct and correct mistakes before they go too far. 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.660
 And that includes studying and learning mistakes made in the past. 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.820
 The failure of the Hyatt Regency walkways is an important case 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:56.980
 which is taught to virtually every engineer. 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.640
 with the aim that such a tragedy will never take place again. 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.760
 Practical Engineering is full of great videos, so go subscribe! 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.340
 I would advise you to start with Grady's videos about hydrostatics. 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.340
 Next time 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.780
 A guest video with an object that has been to the moon.
