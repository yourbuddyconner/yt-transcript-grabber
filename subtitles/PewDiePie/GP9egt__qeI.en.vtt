00:00:00.015 --> 00:00:01.015
 Michael 

00:00:01.145 --> 00:00:02.145
 son of a@# # 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.880
 MacDonald is known as the deity of truth 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.120
 Michael MacDonald 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.980
 Make Another Video About Me Thank you 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.560
 Thank you 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.200
 His first video was made (before he became famous) and he got 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.240
 Every fact 

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:24.175
 A hundred percent right Michael 

00:00:24.175 --> 00:00:27.095
 Never make mistakes and of course there is one about me 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.740
 Let's see it together 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.940
 Before he began to win 4 million a year 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.020
 4 million a year, this is funny 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.160
 Felix Kilberg Hahaha 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.620
 Felix Kilberg, what nonsense 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.580
 Excuse me!!! What ? 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:45.800
 Felix Kilberg 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.720
 Michael made a video about me, named (pewdipie rich life) 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.700
 Will he say my name correctly 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.700
 I'm very excited, to watch 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.980
 The era of the long pewdiepie ... Do you deceive me, I have cheated, Michael 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.700
 Michael, I know you're watching this, I've been cheated 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:00.960
 You are 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.000
 Heck, I've disappointed 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.400
 The owner of YouTube, the owner of the heavy load, but he has nothing to worry about 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.360
 Because it makes ** billions ** and millions of dollars - what! 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.880
 Has he just said ** billions ** and millions 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.560
 ** billions ** and millions 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.880
 Sure he said billions 

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.580
 Billions and millions of dollars 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.300
 YouTube, Michael says I make billions 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.600
 YouTube: How dare you Felix, cancel your channel, we will block you ads%% @ @%, your video content is not suitable for advertisers 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.720
 No, do not block video ads, 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.380
 I'm sorry 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.500
 No harm, Rajokm 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.860
 May be billions 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.740
 pewdiepie does not like spending his fortune on material things 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.880
 Money entered in @ $% $ Oh oh great 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.060
 In fact on the intigram 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:44.180
 Publish that luxury whiskey is the only luxury 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.900
 Will allow himself to spend money on them 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.660
 Heck, this will be the most boring episode in this series 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.740
 Will be the most boring 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.740
 Because I'm so boring 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.340
 I do not spend money on anything, I have my computer, I have whiskey 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.840
 But to see what he will say I have 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.240
 He acquired several pets including his dogs (Edgar and Mia) 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:09.580
 Hahaha 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.260
 Maya, apologize, O God, finding Michael 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.960
 Maya has become your name now 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.780
 Your name Mia is OK now 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.920
 And did not meet that amount - Maya: What! 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.540
 Maya is an economic dog because she has one eye 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.660
 For this it was cheap 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.760
 We bought her when we did not have hopes 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.380
 I bought it from my parents' money in Christmas 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.120
 But she was a blessing because she is a wonderful dog 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.740
 These are cheap 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.500
 This has been well spelled out 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.720
 Perfect dog 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.060
 But he is a blind eye 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.180
 The worst thing happened to me 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.180
 So the money is not worth it 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.180
 Is it worth it? 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.340
 Answer: No (German) 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.520
 He also has a frog named Slippy or Sippy 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.460
 I'm not sure 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.740
 What do you mean, Michael? 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.900
 What 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.620
 Michael McCroden 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:14.900
 What do you mean .... what a frog name pewdipie 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:16.460
 Sleepy 

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.700
 What do you mean? 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.860
 We went well for more and it turned out that pewdiepie owned at least two cars 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.700
 I am not talking about these scraps - this is an insult, man 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.720
 I still own that car, I do not know how to operate it but ....... 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:37.820
 In fact pewdiepie owns a Volvo (xc90) 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.360
 Heck, how they learned about them 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:41.380
 excuse me 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.340
 Michael did a good search 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.760
 How he learned, did not publish it 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.280
 And even the small Sarra model also knew what was happening, Michael 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.600
 Michael, are you out? Michael you bastard 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.020
 He bought a Honda bike model (1982) 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.340
 I've posted this on the intrama la la la laissez-faire last zero 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:11.140
 I did not spend that much money - and lived by the sea in England 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.360
 Rent in this area is not cheap 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.520
 Why did you live here? 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.480
 I do not know 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.980
 pewdiepie is still a tenant for his house and this is a shocking thing 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.720
 Why do everyone think I rented my house? 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.120
 I do not hire, okay 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.560
 You have to invest in real estate 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:33.340
 You have to protect your wealth from inflation 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.440
 I will not end up in thirty years 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.260
 "How are you, it's me 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.060
 Make pewdiepie season 24 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.260
 Who is with him damned prisoners? 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:49.580
 Money nation.com estimated the fortune of pewdiepie at 90 million 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.380
 Damn, they're very generous 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.620
 Wow 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.100
 Fortune pewdiepie its exporters YouTube 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:02.820
 Minus taxes 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.240
 What do you smoke? 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.180
 Do not know that my tax limit of 45% 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:11.600
 Why do I live in Britain? 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:13.780
 Everyone says I am humble 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.320
 If he did not spend money 

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:18.060
 Will not be taxed 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:23.500
 If I end up in Anguilla suddenly, "I'm living in Anguilla now" 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:27.020
 This is because I love Anguilla 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.360
 And not for any other reason 

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.140
 What do we also have in this list 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.720
 Cayman Islands 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.860
 Looks like a good place to live 

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.700
 Or Ghana, Ghana is my favorite place now 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:44.260
 Ghana 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:50.920
 I usually do not care about physical income 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.640
 But seeing this put a smile on my face 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.780
 There is realitystarsnetwork.com 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.940
 Who concluded that his fortune was $ 50 million 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:05.580
 But in fact no one knows the balance pewdiepie the other banker 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.660
 But based on the 15 billion views on his channel and branch projects 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.640
 We expect his wealth to reach me ......... 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.760
 50 million 

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.800
 Pure guess from Michael MacDoudin 

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.640
 Well, if Michael McDroen said it 

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.160
 If you have to be ..... 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:24.200
 correct 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.080
 A fixed fact exists in the memos 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:28.340
 Found in the dictionary 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.000
 Found in the gospel 

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.200
 In this video I will show you his financial situation and what he spent from his wealth 

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:38.380
 I'm Michael MacDoudin, and I have a question 

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:41.860
 Wait a moment, did you name Michael wrong 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.040
 Shut up 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.000
 Am I guilty? 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.640
 Same ..... 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.260
 Crimes 

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.800
 I'm Michael MacDoudin and I have Michael Critton. What happened to the (Mac) 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:53.840
 You can not skip the mac 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:56.640
 What is the name of a pewdiepie photographer? 

00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:59.320
 He is a young man who works hard and does not get enough praise 

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.420
 It has a very nice name 

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:06.240
 Guess his name and the answer will be at the end of the video, and now let's start our ring 

00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:08.760
 Well, what is the name of my photographers Michael? 

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.400
 Anyway to hope he shared some of his whiskey photographer, Michael 

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.920
 His name is Brad 

00:07:14.140 --> 00:07:16.460
 What, I know to learn, sorry, sorry 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.900
 A fixed fact, his name is Michael 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.200
 In June 2014 his friends at that time 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.480
 In the Wall Street Journal 

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:31.000
 They stated that Pewdiepie earned $ 4 million in 2013 

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:33.420
 When things were between them just fine 

00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.580
 wsj? You mean sw ...... 

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:38.260
 s 

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:40.380
 jw? is not it 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:45.780
 I do not know why it is difficult for people to calculate total wealth, 

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.720
 How many thousand views on YouTube? 

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.180
 well good 

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:54.560
 Let's make it two dollars because this is a bad account 

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.000
 Minus taxes 

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.280
 I had to calculate well before I made the last episode 

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:10.860
 I made the mistake 

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:12.620
 Michael 

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:16.440
 You do not miss the facts, do not forget it 

00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.060
 The start of pewdiepie received a small blow in 2017 

00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.300
 When she described the Wall Street as anti-Semitic 

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:26.160
 When they collected comedies from several videos 

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.960
 Including a clear joke 

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:30.500
 Hmm how clear they were thank you Michael 

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.860
 May God bless you 

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:33.320
 Michael his finding 

00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:35.040
 Macrodine 

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:39.160
 And make several young people carry a painting written on it ..... 

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.640
 Well you know what is written in it 

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:43.880
 Yes we do not have to talk about that topic, right Michael? 

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:47.120
 Thanks Michael, may God bless you, love you, call me 

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:51.920
 In any case, it was the most expensive five dollars Felix spent in his lifetime 

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.400
 Yes probably 

00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.020
 Pewdiepie lost several decades care 

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.620
 His entertainment network was closed 

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.460
 YouTube canceled the second season of its program 

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:07.260
 scare pewdiepie Canceled 

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.500
 But they paid me anyway 

00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:17.680
 Can we be friends? Can we be friends? 

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:19.740
 Dance of the Koran 

00:09:20.180 --> 00:09:22.700
 I can not guess the size of the losses 

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.440
 But it can be assumed to be in the millions 

00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:28.460
 But they paid me anyway 

00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:33.740
 More money 

00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:37.720
 Pewdiepie still has other income sources 

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:41.560
 Take a look at his sales line on his site 

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:44.060
 You can buy Spencer at $ 13.49 

00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:50.080
 This is the only thing you can buy on my site now, Spencer's sample 

00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.560
 Trade correctly 

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:57.940
 Shirt for $ 30.99 or a jacket for $ 60 

00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:02.100
 Well first, Michael, your God 

00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.480
 It is clearly written that the quantity is over, so you can not buy it 

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:10.160
 Second, is it really $ 60? No way 

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:12.380
 It's 34 pounds 

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:14.000
 How much this in dollars 

00:10:14.380 --> 00:10:15.700
 It's $ 44 

00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:16.980
 What do you smoke, Michael? 

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.240
 Michael is the truth, man 

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.560
 Inflation will destroy me I'm 100% sure in the coming years I will say 

00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:27.980
 "I'm Pewdiepie Exotic Season 89" 

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.320
 "Hi" 

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.320
 "I'm afraid, afraid of all these things" 

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:38.800
 His new line of content, "Content Gets the Difference," supports his stance against the Wall Street Journal 

00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.320
 I think it's wonderful and most aware I'm not alone who thinks so 

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:44.780
 Awesome, give me your address 

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:48.340
 I will send all the spunner you need 

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.660
 If you bought just one out of 5,000 scenes from the pewdiepie website 

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:55.920
 He will earn nearly $ 40 million 

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:57.920
 You heard the truths 

00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.440
 All of you have bought Spencer from the link 

00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:04.000
 And heal .... 

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:10.260
 My depression 

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.700
 Well Felix, I'm sorry I'm not done yet 

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:15.740
 Of course there is his book "This book loves you" 

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:17.700
 Which was a bestseller in New York 

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:20.700
 "Pewdiepie's tuber simulator" 

00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.720
 They have succeeded brilliantly 

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:26.840
 Believe it or not, I made these things for you to enjoy 

00:11:27.080 --> 00:11:30.060
 I know that not everyone can buy them 

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:32.740
 Everyone has a special financial situation 

00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.880
 But the fact that you supported me 

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.040
 In the things I did myself and put a lot of effort into it 

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.920
 It embarrasses me 

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:44.380
 There are people who do these things for me 

00:11:44.620 --> 00:11:45.860
 This really means a lot to me 

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.800
 It's not that I want you to buy my business to get more money 

00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.040
 Just seeing you in our gatherings is great 

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.600
 I appreciate you 

00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:59.500
 I do not know what he might do, that's what I'm trying to say 

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:01.780
 To see where he spends his money 

00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:03.320
 Let's start with real estate 

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:06.780
 pewdiepie expelled from his apartment east of Brighton by the owner of the apartment 

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.560
 Because of noise during the visualization of his videos 

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:11.380
 Where he lived with his girlfriend 

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:13.040
 how did you find her 

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:16.040
 This was a middle house residential place 

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:18.960
 Second floor of the top, what this nonsense 

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:22.260
 I was surprised that we needed money from the apartment 

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.980
 Edgar destroyed the whole place 

00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:25.780
 Damn 

00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:26.840
 I will never forget 

00:12:27.020 --> 00:12:32.920
 Two-bedroom apartment costs between 1500 - this is very cheap in Brighton 

00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.700
 This is a cheap price 

00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:35.820
 My God 

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:37.300
 Michael his finding 

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:38.600
 He was right 

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.460
 I mean, it's always right, what I'm talking about! 

00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:43.060
 I have to thank my fans for pewdiepie for helping me 

00:12:43.340 --> 00:12:51.480
 I found two pictures of my car pewdiepie on the inside of the intger and they knew what kind of car they were 

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:54.640
 So Michael was not, you're out of order 

00:12:54.760 --> 00:12:55.260
 Damn 

00:12:55.500 --> 00:12:56.560
 You evil ones 

00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:02.720
 I am of course so odd that I got a Swedish car for a Swedish man 

00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:05.140
 The company is full of Chinese, but let's pretend that is not true 

00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:08.240
 So this is the life of a rich pewdiepie 

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:11.180
 I'm Michael McCreden and I'll see you later 

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.560
 This is a Boom video 

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:19.640
 Despite the end of the video Michael kept the ending for me to finish the 10 minutes thanks Michael 

00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.580
 Screw you
