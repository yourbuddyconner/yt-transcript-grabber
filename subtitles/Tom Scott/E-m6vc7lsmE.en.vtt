00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.860
 The road behind me has been closed. There has been a landslide ... 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.140
 ... and that is a problem because this is pretty much the only way that the village of Kelston ... 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.180
 ... and in addition, a dozen others connects with the picturesque ... 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:12.420
 ... town of Bath. There is a detour, but that is more than 22 kilometers, 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.580
 and the municipality can not re-open this road for a few months. 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.660
 There is a solution, an amazing one. 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.380
 This is the Kelston toll road, 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.460
 and this one has not been placed here by the church, but by, well ... this man. 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.600
 MIKE: We were in the local pub one night and the road was closed for about three months. 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.480
 We spoke to a local farmer who owns land here. 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.680
 My wife thought he just had to throw some vowels and maybe ... 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.620
 ... a toll gate so that he could collect toll from people who drove over it. 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.340
 We were enthusiastic. We prepared the ground and laid the road. Without a zoning plan. 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.800
 TOM: As you already expected, the municipality was not very happy at first, 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.440
 but this is the fun: Mike did not break any law. 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:59.320
 In the United Kingdom -in America you would violate the zoning laws-, 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.500
 but in the United Kingdom building without a zoning plan is not a crime in itself. 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.540
 You only violate the law if the government notices it, imposes an ultimatum ... 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.940
 ... and you then refuse to undo your actions. 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.800
 MIKE: We thought they would say, "All right, go on, 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.740
 this is fine, you have our support. " 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.200
 They did not, however. We even had to apply for permission with retroactive effect. 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.620
 TOM: And there were good reasons for that. 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.200
 The municipality stated that they were not sure whether the construction ... 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.280
 ... of the road and driving over it might have an impact on the landslide. 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.360
 It seems that they have taken the risk and it has paid off. 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.860
 Note: they are not the only ones who have taken a reasonable risk with this route. 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.760
 MIKE: My wife and I have a little house in Kelston near the river. 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.280
 We built our house there to convince the road builders that we wanted to build the road, 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.800
 and if it did not work, we would sell the house and pay them with the money. That was the only way. 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.260
 They are from a local company, they agreed. 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:04.340
 We shook hands and sent three men who have laid the road in ten days. 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.600
 150,000 passing cars are needed before we have recovered our investment, but we are ... 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.080
 ... well on the way, we are already at 100,000. The reaction of the people is ... 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.820
 ... was amazing. 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.220
 TOM: The road has even reached Google Maps. 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.700
 Please, the Kelston toll road. 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.560
 Something you might not have known, not only because of its existence, 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.840
 but also because it is still in use. It seems that this will remain the same for several months. 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.360
