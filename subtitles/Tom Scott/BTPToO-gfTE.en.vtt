00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.430
 Here speaks the wartime channel. 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.109
 This country has been attacked with nuclear weapons. 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.160
 The number of victims and the damage is not yet known. 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.370
 Keep listening on this wavelength, stay calm and stay inside. 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.710
 This is the core bunker at Kelvedon Hatch in Essex, and that is Greg of the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.590
 BBC's BritLab reading the actual script that a BBC newsreader would have broadcast from 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.390
 somewhere if the cold war had become hot. In that case, this would be 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.550
 one of the 25 regional seats of the government have been: This is where volunteers would have tried 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.920
 to get out of the nuclear war and lead the country through .. Well, what follows. 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.280
 Their work was not to save lives immediately: if you were in the blast of a 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.350
 nuclear bomb did not survive long. But in the days and weeks after that would be one of them 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.770
 goals have been to predict the fallout. The radioactive material and debris that had been blown into the atmosphere 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.860
 by nuclear bombs. They would determine when survivors left their house - or what 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.190
 about leaving their home - could leave without too much risk of radiation sickness and 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.619
 what civil defense still existed. 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.659
 But how would they have determined that, down here in a bunker while the world was literally ending? 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:12.659
 above their heads? 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.639
 Mainly they had special peephole cameras above the ground: a tin can 

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:22.749
 with a few holes in it and a photographic film on the inside. The blinding flash of one 

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:27.259
 nuclear weapon would leave a mark on the photographic film. It would get a print with the outline 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.759
 and the height. The plan was that a poor wretch would leave the bunker, 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.439
 the film would pick up, and then they would do triangulation with other bunkers and find out: A blast close to the ground 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:41.770
 that produces local fallout, an explosion in the air that spreads much wider, where, when? They could 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.270
 measure the pressure waves, the shock wave when it came through with the help of relatively simple ones 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.420
 instruments, and then they could figure out what the power of the bomb was. They would all merge them 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.999
 on this big board, and then they would be using that, weather reports and reports 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:02.880
 other small, remote bunkers start making terrible calculations. 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.889
 In some bunkers, like this one, they had AWDREY, an electronic system. AWDREY 

00:02:07.889 --> 00:02:12.540
 means the Nuclear Weapon Detection Recognition and Estimation of Strength, and someone must 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.269
 very proud of that acronym. 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.709
 It was all relatively optimistic, however strange that sounds. It would be a disaster, they said, 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.549
 but we will help people through it, we will have weather reports and we will 

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:30.360
 local government centers have to keep everything together. But Great Britain is a small, densely populated one 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.400
 country. Our national archive has a list of what our government thought Soviet 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.349
 goals would be: Every big city, every military base. It can be said that not many people 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:43.610
 could only survive for two days, and very few would have lasted for a month, 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.159
 let alone a year. And there was nothing anyone on the planet could have done in the case 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:53.069
 of a global nuclear war - it would change the climate and be a mass extinction like event. 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.379
 But in what was called a limited exchange there would be places in Britain that could have 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.159
 survive outside the blasting area, such as remote areas, and perhaps a few coastal towns like Brighton 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:08.540
 and Aberystwyth which are far from strategic goals. And maybe some of us, 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:11.409
 using here, have survived. 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.040
 I do some videos together with BBC BritLab. 

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.790
 If you want to see what this mess is about, you can click on the link on the screen or in the description. 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.620
 I almost had you. 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.749
 We repeat this broadcast in two hours. 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:29.620
 Stay tuned to this wavelength and do your radio for now 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.670
 to save the batteries until we broadcast again. 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.330
 This is the end of the broadcast.
