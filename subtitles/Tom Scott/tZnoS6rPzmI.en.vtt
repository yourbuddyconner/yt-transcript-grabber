00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.969
I got an email that said:
"do you want to come and see

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:04.520
an amphibious weed-cutting boat?"

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.779
Yes!

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.320
DEBBIE McNAMARA: It's an amphibian boat,

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.860
so it can work in shallow waters,
because it's tracked.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.140
JAMES DILNOT: On the front
it has scissor cutters,

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.980
and as it goes along,
the T-cutter on the front

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.939
cuts the bottom of the river
and the weed lifts up

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:24.749
and flows down stream.

00:00:24.749 --> 00:00:29.319
JD: We've got a tree in the river,
we're just going to

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:31.939
pull it up onto the bank with the tractor
winch in a minute.

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.859
There's probably in excess
of 15 tonne of weed

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:35.920
actually matted up and behind it.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.100
When that tree gets released,

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.129
and the weed starts to flow down,

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.680
he can break the weed up, and then

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.899
take it out at the weed tie
further downstream.

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.649
DM: The weed will then carry on
down the watercourse,

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.090
and it'll get caught at
what we call a weed tie.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.379
So we put in two deflectors in the water,

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.280
they're like two barriers, and then we've
got an excavator

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.789
that will lift the weed
out of the watercourse

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.320
and put it on the bank.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:06.509
(LAUGHS)
Eels are a protected species,

00:01:06.509 --> 00:01:09.130
and we do our best
to not harm them.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.329
And we have to make sure that
when we remove the weed,

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:12.759
we do it very carefully.

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.810
And we have a set method
of removing the weed

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.670
so as to allow the eels
to carry on going down the watercourse.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.920
JD: Along here it's what we call a W2A cut,

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.159
it's an 80-20.
80% comes out, 20% gets left in.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.600
Where the water flow goes through,
it rips the weed

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.700
out the bottom of the river,
and that'll take it down

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.939
through the centre of Canterbury,
into the sluice gates there.

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.990
And it could potentially
cause an obstruction there

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.270
and take out quite a few houses.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.110
DM: Because if tunnels and culverts
block completely,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:43.909
then the water will back up,
flood properties,

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.229
flood businesses,
and we'll have huge problems.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.060
TOM SCOTT: Thank you very much to the
Environment Agency for showing me around.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.030
If you've got something
similarly odd in your company

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.560
or your organisation, let me know!

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.950
I want to film it and I'm fairly sure
my audience want to see it.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.409
And now, GoPro footage of
chainsawing a log,

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.310
and raking some weed
to make sure it's free of eels.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.829
That is a really weird sentence.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.140
