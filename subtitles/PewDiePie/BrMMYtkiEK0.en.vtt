00:00:00.375 --> 00:00:01.200
 I hope I can help 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:09.560
 Life may be evoked legally in Cyrdale, but few of them will explicitly admit to practicing it now that it has been banned by the Guild of Masons 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.320
 Good-bye 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:23.460
 You may rest in peace 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.740
 Olyfy 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.380
 Play Video Games 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.720
 See someone else playing video games 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.220
 That's right! We will join you now, you guys 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.200
 Leiser 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.080
 Here it is 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.620
 Do you have an idiot, to what degree of folly can it become? 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.700
 Come on, you guys are doing this for years, why do not I appreciate it 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.000
 Opelphion is a double point 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 This game is God's gift to us 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.740
 Thanks Todd Howard, thank you 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.640
 Funny fact! Todd Howard was at the chess club 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.420
 Nothing laughs like this 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.960
 So 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.560
 Let's start now 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.960
 The second video was deleted if anyone wondered what happened to it 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.220
 But we have tons of Olimpin Mims 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:23.300
 Thanks to Becky he seems to have taken it himself without his help to revive this game 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.420
 what happens? 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:35.920
 Stop! If you break the law you have to pay a fine or face your current stolen crime 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.780
 If I push your blood !! 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.280
 This is awesome 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.060
 This game is very good I have not played this game 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.460
 But I know I love her 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.780
 That's all I know 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.360
 Todd Howard, God bless your soul 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.560
 Obviously they were very ambitious with this title and that's what makes them so beautiful 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.940
 I've been writing games since I was 12 years old 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.940
 And 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.400
 The rest of the kids were saying they would play in the middle of the cowboy club 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:13.660
 and I say 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.560
 I will make video games and everyone will play them 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.280
 Hey idiot! Go back to the chess club 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.400
 Who is laughing now? 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.180
 Yes I was in the chess club 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.500
 Hhahahahahahaha 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:30.760
 Who is laughing now? 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.700
 I like how confident it seems and then do not trust it for a moment 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.540
 "Who's laughing now?" 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.440
 "Yes, I was in the chess club" (with a faint voice) 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.040
 May God bless you 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.800
 I'm Rana Bryant, I love dogs! Does not everyone love them? 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.740
 Biodes: Everyone loves them 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.260
 EBay 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:49.700
 * Kills the dog * 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.620
 Hahahaha 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.623
 How to get this perfect timing 

00:02:53.623 --> 00:02:55.500
 Only in Opelvin 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.600
 "I'm Rana Burnett one thing you need to know about me I love dogs" 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.660
 "Does not everyone love them?" 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.580
 How this happened! 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.680
 In most of the games these days all of the curvature and hide 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.180
 Wait for the enemy to come and then wait for the right moves 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.600
 So much patience he is very bored 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.420
 Nothing is described as a real action movie 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.900
 Nothing like the Matrix movie for hundreds of thousands of millions 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.080
 Such as the Battle of Oplevin 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.280
 you are pathetic 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:44.900
 Take this! 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.480
 Damn, when they fail in the long run 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.200
 But you have to go to the nearby distances 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.460
 "you are pathetic" 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.780
 Beware of this fire 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.380
 Now is not this surprising! 

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.400
 There is no sign of them 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.600
 They do it a lot at SkyMar to be honest, but they do it a lot 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.580
 Just kill someone right away. There is no sign of it. I think he went 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.880
 "Scythian anger" 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.640
 Oh My God 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:38.920
 what happens! 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:49.100
 Do everyone have a shoulder dislocation? What is going on? 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.880
 what the hell 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.000
 Todd Howard and Iguick in the shower at the Fleetwood Mac concert 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.800
 "It's true that I am!" 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.800
 "Bethesda Todd Howard" 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.600
 "Hurry, I know you told me not to come" 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.600
 "After we bought SkyMax for NexBOX, I said you concluded" 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.500
 "At least let me defend my case" 

00:05:16.895 --> 00:05:17.895
 "Did you know?" 

00:05:18.475 --> 00:05:19.615
 "The Fall Out 4 is a great game!" 

00:05:21.235 --> 00:05:22.605
 "It does not bear time lobe" 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.040
 "Do you like this?" 

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:29.000
 No, I can not be sorry 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.200
 I will save this for later. 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.300
 "Yes, really, great hero!" 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.300
 "Is there anything you need?" 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.400
 "I can carry your weapon, polish your shoes!" 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.400
 You might shoot in the air. Oh, is it classic? 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.160
 "Oh Gee, are you sure?" 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.100
 "Well, I'll be hanging around arena yards if you need someone to share the land you walk on" 

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.900
 Absolutely beautiful, certainly wonderful! 

00:05:54.665 --> 00:05:55.665
 Oh my God 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:05:59.600
 *Laughter* 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.940
 I've just broken his back, he's okay, he's fine, he's going all the time, he's doing it all the time! 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.480
 what happens ? 

00:06:18.495 --> 00:06:22.800
 This game is very confusing, I think that's why it's fun 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.700
 "You see someone who walked in the past only now" 

00:06:26.715 --> 00:06:32.500
 "Well, if I catch him scream bastard stole from me" 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.500
 *Laughter* 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:43.100
 Are these Americans trying to do like the Northern Accent? , Is this how you see us? , Huh? 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.200
 Racism! (Mimics), have you seen anyone in the sight of everyone do you see this guy there? 

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.775
 Health 

00:06:50.775 --> 00:06:54.900
 You know that the action is very exciting in Opelvin and Skirm, of course 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:07:01.305
 But nothing tempts me and engulfs me like a dialogue that makes me feel like part of the world 

00:07:01.305 --> 00:07:05.100
 It seems like real dialogues, real people, true communication! 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:06.935
 "How are you doing?" 

00:07:07.305 --> 00:07:10.745
 "I've been better, I hope things get better." 

00:07:10.745 --> 00:07:11.700
 Oh 

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:13.700
 EBay 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:16.100
 "Welcome" 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.800
 "How are you today?" 

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:20.400
 "IAM fine what about you?" 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.895
 "I'm fine, what other parts of Timrell's news" 

00:07:26.495 --> 00:07:28.375
 "Nothing, I love to talk about it" 

00:07:29.685 --> 00:07:31.685
 "good bye" 

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.200
 At first, I thought he was the same guy just talking to himself 

00:07:36.200 --> 00:07:43.225
 But it is clear that the same voice actor of these two people interact, "I have been better how are you better?" 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.100
 It's as long as the same person or something like that, it's incredible! I have already offered this shot, but it is very funny 

00:07:52.155 --> 00:07:56.900
 This man absolute absolute risk to society 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.500
 "I do not know you and do not care to know you" 

00:08:07.785 --> 00:08:10.685
 Are they testing this game at all? 

00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:16.600
 "I do not know you and do not care to know you" 

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:22.100
 Well, thank you, this is I'm literally in school with everyone 

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:28.175
 I do not know you and I do not care about your knowledge, thank you Pat, the voice of acting is just to make mistakes 

00:08:28.175 --> 00:08:33.300
 "Lady Embernox hired a new captain, Lady Embernox hired a new captain of the" 

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:35.300
 *Laughter* 

00:08:36.015 --> 00:08:37.200
 He really looks like him 

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.700
 Would like to do this I know he did 

00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:42.400
 "Nature guards under my feet!" 

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:47.900
 "I mean things that will curse you or they may call you a bear to rip you down!" 

00:08:48.455 --> 00:08:50.725
 "Nature guards under my feet!" 

00:08:51.095 --> 00:08:53.895
 "I mean things that will curse you or they may call you a bear to rip you down!" 

00:08:55.615 --> 00:08:58.345
 Wow it's great to see a game .. 

00:08:58.345 --> 00:09:01.005
 Speak clearly! 

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.095
 I feel like I'm talking to a real person! 

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:04.620
 Do not you feel it too !? 

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.260
 Press IK if you feel it too! 

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.380
 Thanks! 

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.740
 It's something .. 

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:10.460
 An innovative video game 

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.980
 The characters will remember their interactions with you 

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.360
 Such as "Lord of the Rings" 

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:19.340
 This really does not include the O'Levian 

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.420
 Opilivan actually lives for his name 

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:23.940
 Because all the characters were really losing their memory 

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:26.080
 "I'm the captain in the castle" 

00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.160
 "The Dion is the captain of the village" 

00:09:28.680 --> 00:09:33.040
 "It's simple, I do not care what happens to the village, it's a debt business" 

00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.200
 "Bai" 

00:09:37.580 --> 00:09:38.860
 "You gray fox!" 

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:47.180
 "You are under arrest for ... for all kinds of crimes, you are dead or alive! 

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:51.855
 "I'll make a captain for this!" 

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.160
 Awh wonderful! 

00:09:56.780 --> 00:09:57.480
 "A man fell!" 

00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:00.440
 He's just a captain who wants to become captain! 

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.360
 very sad 

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.360
 "I just ask enough to feed my children" 

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.900
 "Thank you, dear man!" 

00:10:10.335 --> 00:10:13.265
 "Thank you, dear man!" 

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.445
 "Thank you, dear man!" 

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:25.160
 Bless you because you pressed for the video! 

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:26.480
 Thank you, dear man! 

00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:35.500
 *Fight* 

00:10:35.640 --> 00:10:36.800
 "I was here just a second ago!" 

00:10:41.860 --> 00:10:47.520
 "You, I have seen you before, you have blood in your hand!" 

00:10:47.555 --> 00:10:50.635
 "Keep your blade, you bastard bastard!" 

00:10:50.635 --> 00:10:52.765
 "And I will not throw you down myself!" 

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:59.120
 "Stay safe, citizen !, It's scary times!" 

00:11:00.995 --> 00:11:03.915
 You just killed someone! How do you do this! 

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.780
 "Keep distance" 

00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.000
 *Explosion* 

00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:18.560
 Damn, you will get such games 

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:19.800
 I doubt it! 

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:21.680
 Owner or your life! 

00:11:24.540 --> 00:11:26.980
 "You're smarter than you look" 

00:11:27.100 --> 00:11:29.580
 He seems fair, does he have braids in his hair? 

00:11:32.215 --> 00:11:35.625
 "Take it, it's nothing to me anyway" 

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.760
 All the video is about me and I say (damn, I'm laughing)! 

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.400
 how did that happen! 

00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:46.400
 Do you see, this person is exposed to existential necessity after being stolen from him 

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.740
 He earns money from stealing others and is just being robbed! 

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:54.340
 He can not say you're wrong because he did worse 

00:11:54.345 --> 00:11:57.315
 I mean yes he calls us useless, is not it? 

00:11:57.315 --> 00:11:59.775
 Because he compares our lives with money 

00:12:02.495 --> 00:12:05.735
 "Take it, it's nothing to me anyway" 

00:12:05.735 --> 00:12:08.745
 Yes, he is a little sad 

00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:12.185
 But of course the top cake 

00:12:12.185 --> 00:12:13.440
 Cake of cake 

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.720
 The cake inside the cake 

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:15.960
 Guardians of course! 

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.960
 Nothing beats artificial intelligence everywhere 

00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.300
 Opelivan is truly a king of artificial intelligence, he can not be smarter than that 

00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:25.940
 "What is that" 

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:34.820
 *Laughter* 

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.640
 "Stop" 

00:12:38.400 --> 00:12:39.400
 Very skillful 

00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:42.480
 "Stop you, you criminal!" 

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.845
 "No one breaks the law in my presence" 

00:12:44.845 --> 00:12:46.600
 "I will confiscate the things you stole!" 

00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:48.720
 "Now pay the fine or you will be jailed!" 

00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:53.440
 "Then pay with your blood!" 

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.580
 Do you wear mascara? 

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:02.280
 .... 

00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:09.480
 It's the damn game 

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:11.680
 My God 

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.800
 I can not distinguish 

00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:17.820
 It continues! 

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:20.380
 One has to stand! 

00:13:20.380 --> 00:13:22.560
 "Live emperor" 

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:23.960
 "what happens!" 

00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:30.600
 "It's over, you broke laws!" 

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:32.160
 "Your enjoyment is nearing completion!" 

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.940
 "You will take all the stolen goods that you have" 

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:37.000
 "Next step for you" 

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000
 "Pay your love or drag you away!" 

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:44.740
 "Then pay with your blood!" 

00:13:46.540 --> 00:13:47.920
 I'm done! 

00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:49.960
 I have highland! 

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:50.720
 * Plating * 

00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:51.740
 We improved this all 

00:13:51.740 --> 00:13:53.520
 Subscribe to Bacon Channel 

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.920
 I will put his channel link under 

00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:58.300
 He is still uploading such videos 

00:13:58.320 --> 00:13:59.780
 I could not lift this video without him 

00:13:59.780 --> 00:14:01.040
 And frankly 

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:01.980
 It's so funny 

00:14:02.140 --> 00:14:03.420
 I.. 

00:14:03.420 --> 00:14:05.960
 It 's kind of weird because I feel that I do not have to play the game 

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:09.180
 Because I have a prediction that all the interactions will be like this 

00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.460
 It's all I've ever seen about the game 

00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:15.280
 But if you want me to play the game, I'll be excited and be fun 

00:14:15.285 --> 00:14:17.905
 I do not know, but if you liked the video press 

00:14:17.905 --> 00:14:19.640
 And I'll see you tomorrow 

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.340
 I wish this video was fun I'm sure it was already 

00:14:22.340 --> 00:14:25.820
 Thank you very much for your safety (ProFest) 

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:40.820
 :)
