 We like to have fun on this channel. We just laugh that it is not something dangerous, so there is no reason for distress.

 If I were my mother, I would send that boy directly to rehabilitation 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.939
 Rehab is what I'm trying to say, 'Cause there's no way 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.900
 My son's flesh and blood will choose my favorite Natsuki girl, disgusting

 From 2012 to 2018, it took me 6 years to develop beard cubes 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:10.500
 Koz Poopie is the god of swistian Viking, and that is why his beard grows so effortlessly.
