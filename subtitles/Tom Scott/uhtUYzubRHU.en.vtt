 How to make something that can last for a thousand years? 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.380
 Because it is a long time - man-made things can rarely last for a thousand years. 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.660
 The building behind me is not designed to last that long. 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.700
 Perhaps for about a century, they were razed and rebuilt. 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.980
 The Goff pyramid has been maintained for an extremely long time. 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.880
 Some universities can be traced back to nearly a thousand years ago. 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:27.540
 There is a construction company in Japan that started in 578 AD and closed down a few years ago. 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.940
 But if you have a project that will last for so long, you won't have a long life to see the day of completion. 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:35.920
 I mean, we hope that life extension technology will appear - but now, 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.980
 At the very least, human beings have lived for more than a hundred years. 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.620
 So what if your project needs to last for a thousand years? 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.080
 Behind me is Longplayer, located in the Trinity Buoy Wharf lighthouse in London. 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.780
 Longplayer is a music making with 磬, 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:57.300
 Designed to sustain a thousand years - from the beginning of 2000 to the end of 2999. 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.240
 This is a very long time. therefore, 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.100
 It cannot be done by an individual, it must be a company. 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.400
 Here, a non-profit charity called Longplayer Trust 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.320
 His job is to maintain the operation of the composition. 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.260
 It is now synthesized by a computer. 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.600
 There is a large instrument that is being completed there. 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.600
 The work of the trust is as follows: 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.920
 • Update your computer when needed, 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.100
 • Translate software into another language when needed, 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.620
 • Find someone to take over for the Longplayer Trust Committee 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.800
 In this way, in 980 years, 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.580
 Whether here, or elsewhere, or rising sea level: completely in another city or country, 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.320
 You can still hear Longplayer music somewhere in the world. 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.920
 This is how to make something that lasts for a thousand years. 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.200
 It takes a lot of people to participate and design an entity that lasts for so long - a company. 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.200
 This is something you may not know. 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.040
