00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 There is a dialogue in Cinderella: "Dream is your inner wish." 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.660
 That is the castle of Cinderella. 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.920
 This is certainly not true. Dreams are just random movements that the brain tries to translate. 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.320
 But this sentence is really interesting. 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.580
 Some people’s professions are "dream scientists." 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.840
 This is the collective name for the dream explorer. 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.420
 Their dream is "lucid dream" 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.620
 That means you can stay awake in your dreams. 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.840
 Know that you are dreaming and control what you want 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.560
 Fly, chat with others, overcome fear, all the things you want to do 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.680
 I also tried to do this, but it was not very successful. 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:37.700
 But I also learned the same skills that you may not understand: discriminate dreams 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.280
 That is a test, starting from a few times a day. 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.020
 This is obviously a good way to learn to clear your dreams. 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.080
 The simple test is: read some text 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.720
 Any text, such as on a sign, in a newspaper, in any text 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.720
 These words not only have nothing to say, but also change as your eyes move away and move back to them. 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.820
 They are just words that your brain suddenly associates with 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.780
 Any word that can be found in the dictionary, there is no logic at all. 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:09.000
 Any words that your brain suddenly thinks of, or any nerves that suddenly become active in your brain's language area 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.840
 Will be the text you read 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.220
 Now look down at the things in front of you. 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.020
 Maybe the computer in the dream can't be used, it's also a good sign. 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.900
 If you are dreaming, if you are using Windows 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.040
 In short, see if the text has changed. 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.280
 If not, don't wake up too early. 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.920
 Let’s play in the dream first. 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:31.840
 This is a lucid dream that you may not understand. 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.520
 I guess this is Donald Duck!
