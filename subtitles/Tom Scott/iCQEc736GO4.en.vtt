00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:01.630
 TOM: Are you ready? 

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:03.020
 PAUL: Yes. 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.410
 TOM: Pedal. 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:05.109
 [squeaking] 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:06.499
 PAUL: Return. 

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:07.899
 TOM: Ok. 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:12.290
 I am at the foot of the Dolomites, 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.400
 An hour's drive north of Venice, Italy. 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.660
 This place is called Ai Pioppi, The Poplars. 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.849
 40 years ago, a man named Bruno opened the restaurant. 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.599
 Then he learned to solder, 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:29.509
 He thought: Ok, I am doing some simple rides. 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.240
 For those who come to my restaurant. 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:39.090
 Today, after 40 years, Bruno's work looks like this. 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.880
 Is this a terrible wheel of the dead? Bicycle death? 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.110
 I don't know how to translate it at Ai Pioppi. 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.110
 Just think of all the strange powerplants here, playgrounds, theme parks...!! 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.210
 Totally dependent on manpower, 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.259
 Everything here won't generate energy out of thin air. 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:06.539
 In this case, use your foot. 

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:11.219
 There are all sorts of weird things here, and - 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:12.270
 Ah! 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.380
 carry on! 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.499
 [shouting] 

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:19.670
 it has started! 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.780
 pedal! pedal! 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.890
 [screaming out loud] 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.179
 carry on! carry on! Yes! 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.289
 [More loudly yelling] 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:38.289
 This is amazing. It only exists in - come on! 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.920
 Continue to pedal! 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.119
 That is... oh no, that is my phone! 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:52.999
 That is my mobile phone. That is my mobile phone 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:58.389
 Nothing, we continue - hey, let's go again 

00:01:58.389 --> 00:01:59.200
 broken? 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.639
 PAUL: I am fine. 

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:06.979
 TOM: Well, um, I might have broken my phone. 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.160
 good news! I didn't break my phone. 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.890
 Bad news: I broke my face. 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.030
 About five minutes after the video was taken. 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.500
 It’s all my pot, not theirs. 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.040
 I am running on some metal, I shouldn’t do that. 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.690
 I fell and my face touched the ground. Then I met a lovely Italian doctor. 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.690
 Stitched 7 stitches on my face 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.820
 Obviously if you do something like this, the degree of risk is acceptable. 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.700
 If you don't want to take the risk, don't go, but 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.620
 I really recommend you to go. This is really great, 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.850
 Everyone there is great, and the first aid they provide is also in place. 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.530
 But if you go: please don't be too reckless, don't be like me. 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.530
 Don't think that you are invincible, just because you have stepped on a few laps. 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.950
 Obey the safety warnings, be absolutely cautious, I will look at you around you. 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.740
 Then if there is no video next week 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.569
 That means I went to remove the 7 stitches that were stitched on my face. 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.080
