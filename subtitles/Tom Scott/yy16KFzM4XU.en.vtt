00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.920
 I am thirty miles (48.28 km) exactly 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.720
 From the intersection of Beverly Avenue and North La Senga Avenue 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.589
 In downtown Los Angeles 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.230
 This is part of the area of ​​the studios, 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.660
 A thirty-mile circle includes Southern California, 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.570
 Which explains why many planets in science fiction films look alike. 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.500
 Look, if I was shooting when I asked my crew 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.759
 To meet me here, outside the region 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:26.699
 I will have to pay them for their time and for their visits to the site. 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.189
 But if I walk a few steps in this direction, into the studio area. 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.320
 He pays the crew since they arrive here. 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.570
 Imaging inside the area is considerably cheaper. 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.500
 Most studios are located within the area, 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.080
 As well as many places you will see in movies and television. 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.010
 Griffith Park and Brunson Valley are within the area, 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.690
 Near the center of Hollywood, so here was the Adam West Cave, 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.580
 To the place where the walls of Captain Picard fell, and with them, (almost), 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.140
 Any US television program needs such terrain. 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.399
 And Vasquez Heights, which have been used in many television programs, movies and music videos 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.140
 There is even a special Wikipedia page to enumerate them, 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.960
 It is conveniently located twenty-nine miles (46.67 km) from the center of the area 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.900
 If these rocks were a little farther, who would have known what would have happened? 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.560
 Perhaps Bill and Ted Kana had been killed by twins, the evil Allyn, elsewhere. 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.969
 Why thirty miles? 

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:22.969
 Rules of the Union. 

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:25.950
 Hollywood town follows the union, and since ancient time has been negotiated 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.750
 The 30 miles was "local" and everything outside was not. 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.720
 Assume that after many, many differences 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.080
 Between ITU representatives and studios. 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.950
 Now, exceptions have been added over time, the rules are now complex, 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.210
 And I can not explain them all even if I try. 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.509
 Production coordinators usually have that work. 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.429
 Now, in short, this 30-mile region, the TMZ 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:48.380
 And yes, this is where the site of controversy and gossip and gossip, 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.219
 This is the reason why the crew of the entreprise seems to be behind him 

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.739
 They will go to a place where many have gone before.
