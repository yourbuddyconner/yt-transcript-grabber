00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.070
 The world's most dangerous path. 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.370
 The world's most unreliable, the world's deadliest. 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.530
 That and much more is this. 

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.769
 This is El Caminito Del Rey, near Malaga, 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.160
 south of Spain. 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.039
 And this was once the world's most dangerous path 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:16.780
 or something in that direction. 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.920
 It was built between 1901 and 1905 by sailors and prisoners, 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.869
 who were accustomed to the high work, 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:24.630
 or had no choice. 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.789
 It was used to move between two hydro-electric power stations, 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.430
 which apparently already existed in Spain in 1900. 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.050
 I was also surprised. 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.829
 They called it El Caminito Del Rey, the path of the king, 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.239
 after King Alfonso XIII walked about it 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.560
 But that was not how it looked at that time. 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.230
 It was only a bit of metal in stones at 45 degrees 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.640
 with some concrete on it. 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.010
 And maybe a safety thread with it, 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.810
 but for today it was not safe. 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.289
 And later the path was no longer used 

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:55.609
 and expired 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:58.260
 and eventually it fell apart. 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.440
 But thrill seekers continued. 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.760
 When the internet announced the path, 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.980
 people came from here and there 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.080
 to walk this tapped, but just safe, path. 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.590
 The web is full of photos from 2005 or 2006 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.840
 in which people hold on to safety threads and walk on narrow metal chunks 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.680
 to go to the next piece. 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.500
 But it does not look like that anymore. 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.670
 People died again and again, 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.509
 with one person per so many years. 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.549
 And eventually the local government decided it was enough. 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:31.549
 And eventually the local government decided it was enough. 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.659
 They closed it. 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.220
 But that worsened it. 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.390
 Because now thrill seekers wanted to walk the most dangerous path 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.799
 what was forbidden. 

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.840
 Finally, a solution was found: building a new path, 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.119
 on the old path, 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:47.450
 so that the contemporary public would be safe. 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.299
 There are now safety helmets, 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:51.000
 handrails, wires, 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.830
 a guard who checks on tickets 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.710
 and wi-fi and toilets. 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:58.060
 And you know what? It's working. 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.060
 And you know what? It's working. 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.619
 It is still sensational, but also safe. 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.909
 Now many more people can experience this beautiful place and view. 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:06.909
 Now many more people can experience this beautiful place and view. 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:07.939
 But online? 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:10.380
 There it is still the most dangerous path. 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.730
 There are still those blog posts from 2000 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:18.520
 and those old photos and old YouTube videos that say: 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.270
 "This is still dangerous and frightening." 

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:21.270
 "This is still dangerous and frightening." 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.440
 And nobody on the internet checks that for a while, 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.850
 so everyone is still sharing it. 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.420
 But it is no longer that dangerous. 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.390
 It used to be like base jumping, 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:31.890
 only for the real daredevils, 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.140
 the adrenalin addicts ... but now? 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.670
 Now there are tourists who are not afraid of heights. 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.040
 That seems better to me. 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.590
 Even though the clickbait is no longer true, 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.040
 a lot of people can now enjoy a great place. 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:55.100
