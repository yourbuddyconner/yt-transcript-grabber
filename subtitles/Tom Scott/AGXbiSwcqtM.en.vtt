00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.100
 In Richmond Park, a huge royal park and nature reserve in west London 

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.559
 is this strange path of trees. 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:13.360
 And in central London there is this: The Cheesegrater, a strange, wedge-shaped tower block. why would 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.700
 you build in this form, if you can also build it up straight, and the double number 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.210
 can build spaces to rent out? 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.910
 Well, to explain it, I went here: This is the New London Model, in the NLA gallery 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.580
 in The Building Center. It is a huge, interactive scale model of London, which is all kinds 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.739
 information from the city shows - including this. 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.859
 These are projected views, or sightlines. In the 1930s, London started what 

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:43.190
 to get high buildings at that time, such as Unilever House. Now they seem small, but a few floors 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:49.309
 high, but it was enough to block some views of St Paul's Cathedral. 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:53.510
 The tallest building in the city, and that had been for a very long time. It had just been overtaken 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.969
 by the Post Office Tower in 1962. There was a public outrage about this and that's why the locale 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.469
 authorities protected certain views of the cathedral and the parliament building. 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.670
 That weird path of trees in Richmond Park points straight to St Paul's Cathedral - despite that 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.070
 you could only see St Paul's through a telescope, you will always have the opportunity to 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.480
 St Paul's, through a telescope, to see from here. There will never be a large building around the view 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.540
 to block. And besides, it is also not allowed to build anything behind St Paul's, 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.280
 because that would obstruct the view just as much. You can not even go high at St Paul's 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:32.210
 in the neighborhood, because that would spoil the view from the river side: the One New Change shopping center, 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.770
 next to St Paul's, has been carefully designed to circumvent all these restrictions. 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.030
 Look at the Shard, London's tallest building: it is bounded to the left and right by this one 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.200
 protected sightlines, but is just built outside. 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.780
 And all that explains the Cheesegrater's weird form: the view of St Paul's from Fleet Street 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.070
 had to be protected and leaning to the left of the tower was enough for the approval of the welfare committee 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.170
 So the question remains: How long would these rules remain? London is rising, gradually, now the housing market 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.950
 and putting foreign investments under pressure. In a hundred years, 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.280
 if this model has been replaced by some futuristic hologram: would we still be able to stand 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.170
 in Richmond Park and then see St Paul's? 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:19.959
 Or will money have won from history? 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.200
