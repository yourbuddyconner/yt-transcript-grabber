00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.880
 Let me quickly adjust the current situation. 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.200
 A few days ago, a live master named Alinity decided to copyright. 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.740
 Complaint c( 0 〰 0 )੭ 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.120
 One of my videos... Is this stalk still funny? I don't think so 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:10.960
 Because I used the word "Twitch Thots" 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.600
 For me, I use this word without any malicious 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.640
 Even the word is not directly directed at Alinity 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:19.800
 Instead, it refers to the films I was watching at the time. 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.880
 Then she expresses her anger by capturing the income of my film. 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.660
 Although this kind of thing (copyright complaints) happens very often, it is obvious that she just complained about my copyright in the film. 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.600
 How can it be super annoying everywhere? 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.320
 87Twitch 淫女

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.420
 Really, true and false... Did he really talk about it? 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.920
 I want to sue this guy’s film copyright, just for this word (Thots), I want to sue his copyright. 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.460
 YOOO 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.420
 Can we sue the copyright of the latest Pewdiepie film? 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.040
 Can it be right now? 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.960
 He called us Twitch 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.080
 If she feels offended 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.700
 And because I am angry with this word 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.160
 At least I can understand her point of anger but you can’t be angry 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.620
 You can do this 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.560
 "I want to sue this person's film copyright because I don't like what he said." 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.820
 You do this, there are big problems in the law. 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.420
 Because you abuse the copyright law 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.340
 I don't know why she (laughs) has been getting worse 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.400
 This whole thing 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.260
 But then she publicly announced that she made a lot of money for doing something similar. 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.460
 Company 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.760
 Collab 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.140
 Then they made me a profit 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.180
 They made a profit of 700 mg last month by relying on the copyright of the film accusing others. 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.380
 Good money 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.260
 Good der money [̲̅$̲̅(̲̅ ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°̲̅)̲̅$̲̅] 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.360
 Stealing someone else’s income 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.140
 At this time, I haven't said a word in the whole sentence that the whole network is very black. Alinity is based on her mistakes. 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.660
 And her disgusting words. 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.980
 I didn't have to respond to this. 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:44.020
 Believe it or not, but I don't like to make gossip, but a statement after her stepped on my line. 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.560
 Push all the questions to me 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.960
 Then I feel that I have to respond at least... I did the same 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.280
 But at the same time, I also 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.620
 I apologized to her. In fact, I apologized twice. Many people told me, "You are so boring." 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.780
 "You should not apologize to her because her actions are wrong." But this is not my point. 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.100
 Because of the way she handles the problem 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.040
 Super super bad 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.140
 Push all the mistakes to someone other than her 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.480
 Let me say that at least I can admit that I said something wrong and she can confess her fault. 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.760
 Then we can end this whole thing and everyone is not owed each other. 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.600
 These have not happened at all! After I apologized, she also sent a film to respond. 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.000
 I want to say that Collab really did a really bad thing. 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.240
 Then I think.... 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.160
 The main problem with the whole thing is that Collab is going to sue for copyright. 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.480
 Thank you 喔Alinity ヽ〳՞ ᗜ ՞ 〵ง 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.360
 Let everyone focus on how bad Collab is. 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:36.160
 Really the perfect saint, the company you signed the contract. 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.900
 You also show off their help to get you money by complaining about someone else’s copyright. 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.300
 It turns out that they are bad people. Are you really talking about the key points? 

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.320
 So she not only did not admit that she complained about the copyright of my film, but it was her fault about her current situation. 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.920
 Instead, she just blames Collab 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.840
 In this case, I have not seen that she is actually responsible for her own actions. Why is she still being black? 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.000
 And why am I still being hated? ? ?乁| ・ 〰 ・ |ㄏ 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.520
 Later, the film was removed from the fake copyright complaint. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.060
 I have been talking about copyright complaints (copy strike is Alinity misuse is actually a copy claim) 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.520
 And the post says that I am accusing her of the copyright of the film. 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.680
 I don't know how this might happen, but I can assure you that this is not what I did. 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.740
 This is not irony, I mean really 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.540
 Then this is her reaction to this episode. 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.460
 Youtube didn't ask me about copyright issues at all. 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.540
 It was directly removed from the shelves. 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:20.340
 Really silly 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.220
 He has a video about me but I can't make a film about him. 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.300
 Can we sue Pewdiepie's latest video copyright? ⋌༼ •̀ ⌂ •́ ༽⋋ 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.760
 You are right, Alinity is really bad when it is taken off the shelf. 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:31.080
 I am very glad that you finally realized this. 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.800
 (laugh) 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.060
 The result... she still didn’t learn anything. 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.160
 I went directly to Youtube and asked them to take the copyright complaint. 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:43.680
 There are no problems that I can't see now. As I said, I don't know how this might happen but someone does use my name to sue her movie copyright. 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.240
 But this is totally wrong, so now the film is on the shelves. 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.020
 But it is not a trivial matter to abuse copyright. This is why you should not do this. 

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.880
 (laugh) 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.380
 Then in this video, she said so. 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.620
 The message I want to convey is, for example, content creators 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.020
 Should not 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.220
 Calling a girl slut or kinky woman 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.140
 Or any nicknames based on their appearance 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.380
 I won't call you a slut, I never called you a slut. 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.420
 Why are you so insinuated? 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.540
 Do you want the situation to be more disadvantageous for me? Do you have to use these things to get yourself back? 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:18.600
 HMMMM ? (╭ರ_•́) 

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:19.960
 Let me remind you: this is your expression 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.400
 This is the expression when you watch the movie. 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.680
 She even tweeted that she was unwilling to accept my apology. 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.340
 This is the point that makes me angry. In his film, I don’t want a personal apology when I take apologize to me. 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.660
 I want him to know that it is not interesting to talk about a kinky woman because it is "a factor that is a very fascinating factor." 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:39.880
 Here she used what I said in the previous film, so she did see my video. 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.240
 But she is very deliberately ignoring the part of my apologizing to her. "Alinity, I am sorry for calling you Twitch." 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.480
 "I will definitely be very careful when I use this word in the future." 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.480
 I said this in the film and there is no ridicule for her. 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.620
 If you can't accept my apology, what do you want me to do? That is, what else can I do? QQ 

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:07.380
 This is simply that she is used to things in her way, and her way is to constantly pretend that she is a poor victim. 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:10.800
 It’s like if I look like a victim, maybe they will finally come to me. 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:16.160
 She is constantly pretending to be a victim, but there is a newsletter from Pew News to give Alinity 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.880
 No one buys your account. •̀۝•́ ༽╯ 

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:20.440
 I know that I don’t act like a smart person. 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:24.200
 But I know that you are not stupid, you don’t know what you are doing. 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.940
 You reveal your personal clothing in the live. 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.280
 This is our fault, right? Then I will open the full screen and continue watching. 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.520
 When I bend over, my butt is facing the camera. 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.900
 This is also our fault, right? 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.340
 In the movie, you just want to see your ass. You know that she didn’t do anything. 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.880
 Deliberately eating deep when eating a popsicle against the camera 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.820
 This, this is our fault, right? Because you have pain in your mouth, you need to use a popsicle to ice, right? 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:49.720
 Oh, you are just playing a game in the invincible short skirt of the century. 

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.560
 This is our fault. We shouldn’t look at it with color. Right? 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:56.400
 "Oh everyone, I am just adjusting my camera." 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.160
 "I don't know what the camera is all about." 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.040
 "If you have any non-participation"...is our fault 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.740
 "Oh, sorry, I just pushed the underwear in the middle to let everyone see what it is like to concentrate on the underwear." 

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.120
 "If you have any sexual associations, it is your fault." 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.460
 "How do you think so?" 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.600
 "Oh, I am sorry, I just fed the adult actress to eat." 

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.920
 "There is no sexual meaning at all, you want to be your fault." 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.300
 Seems to see what formula is it? 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:25.600
 You may want to say: Oh, these are all specially selected by you. Her type of film is easy to find. 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.040
 It’s really a dazzling endless 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:31.040
 I don’t really have any opinion on this type of film when I say it in my video. 

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:31.800
 87Twitch 淫女

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.560
 I am not yelling at the words that seem to be known all over the world. 

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.460
 So you did these things yourself and then I refused to accept my apology when I apologized. 

00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:42.800
 I still apologize twice. 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:45.040
 What do you want? 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.920
 You have been afflicting your situation more and more embarrassed and I have not even done anything. 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.220
 But by the way, I found this film, in this... 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.760
 This channel on the channel called "L of the day" has some pretty movies for this event. 

00:06:56.060 --> 00:07:00.340
 And his channel also has experience in original film that has been accused of copyright by Collab DRM. 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.020
 Just because Alinity is asked to come out 

00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:04.260
 And now my Twitter has long been... 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.640
 Fully overwhelmed by Alinity's message like retweet 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:14.400
 And those who still yell at me and stand on her side are very rare. 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:16.600
 I sincerely recommend that you must go and see 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:17.280
ヽ〳՞ ᗜ ՞ 〵ง 

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:22.720
 She didn’t have any problems with retweeting those messages... But you know, if today I am doing this, it’s really the worst demonstration. 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:29.560
 There is a film that she publicly admits, her marriage scams her move to Colombia. 

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.720
 Marry a man 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.480
 Then she can immigrate to Canada 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.500
 "You didn't make any money, but you have a lot of work." 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:43.880
 "I wanted to say "No, I don't want to die like this" and then I marry a Canadian... I moved to Canada together, then I divorced him." 

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.200
 She has a whole film that is talking about it because you know that the wrong ones are all of us. 

00:07:53.640 --> 00:07:55.180
 Even if she herself publicly admits, the fault is still us. 

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:59.980
 Many people... a lot of his little fans, a lot of nine-year-old children let me block them on Instagram. 

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.540
 And I want to tell you that the fans are really nine-year-olds, they are very young children. 

00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.740
九All nine children who are watching this film 

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.160
 I know that you are united like the army, just wait for me to order 

00:08:10.320 --> 00:08:13.320
 "Who are we going to attack next! Nine-year-olds! Let's go together!" 

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:13.960
 "哈哈!"╰༼ ⋋ ‸ ⋌ ༽╯ 

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:18.920
 And they all mistakenly report my situation to the Canadian government. It’s really illegal to do so. 

00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.340
 Oh... so 4 illegal counters? 

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:25.000
 Thank you for your encouragement from the legal expert Alinity. 

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.600
 Yes, we think that she is wrong in marriage scams. 

00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:31.280
 Even if she is very openly speaking, she clearly stated it. 

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:32.380
 How do you have a face to think that she has committed a marriage fraud? 

00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:34.300
 She did not personally speak these four words. 

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.040
 Everyone has to know what to say for themselves. 

00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:39.720
 I know that this sentence is very strange for me. 

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.680
 But all this is really getting ridiculous 

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:44.620
 And she later ran out to say 

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.400
 I am not the first person to have been attacked by the community like him (Pewds). 

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:52.080
 She seems to imply that I have been waiting for the next person to attack but it is obviously her own. 

00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:53.900
 One hand caused such a situation 

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:55.700
 I don't know how many times I have to reiterate this. 

00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:00.020
 I don't know what to do but everything doesn't stop. 

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.200
 But...you, when you as a content creator 

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.760
 You have to... 

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.760
 Take responsibility for your community 

00:09:06.820 --> 00:09:12.060
 So you use your community to call me out and face it is completely okay, but because you are a relatively small channel 

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:17.740
 So I am not allowed to defend myself, right? She has been suggesting that I seem to be ban or what. 

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.700
 I think 

00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.260
 As a content creator, you have to take responsibility 

00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:28.260
 For those who follow you, and what you said when you have followers 

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:29.600
 I don't think this is right. 

00:09:29.780 --> 00:09:32.220
 Just let your community 

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.280
 To bully others, just like the way I was bullied 

00:09:35.340 --> 00:09:39.320
 I didn't say anything until I had to be forced to come out and defend myself. 

00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:44.680
 It’s the netizens who’ve left a message based on the bad way of handling and the wrong wording. 

00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:49.240
 Then you blame me on my fans, it’s really dumbfounded. 

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.160
 You have to turn the situation into this 

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:55.860
 I also tried to solve this, but guess what? The flame is still burning! 

00:09:55.940 --> 00:10:02.840
 Still burning, she then publicly admitted that she has been privileged on Twitch. 

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:06.220
 But... still our fault, let’s see it directly. 

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:10.080
 You all imagine that you have lived for five years or a full-time live master. 

00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:11.620
 I used to be drunk 

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:18.480
 I used to fall and my ass was exposed, but Twitch always supported me behind my back. 

00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.779
 It’s like "Oh, everything is fine, you just have to delete that clip, we are very good, it won't be like me." I worked very well with Twitch. 

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:27.240
 My channel has never been banned for 24 hours and has never been banned. 

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:29.040
 Maybe this is the problem 

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:36.760
 She never had to be forced to bear the consequences for her behavior. Twitch gave her a gold medal as she said. 

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:37.860
 "噢天,Alinity" 

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.300
 "You have violated the Terms of Service, but as long as the film is deleted, we will not ban you." 

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:47.540
 When the rules on Twitch are super strict, many people are often banned because of these regulations. 

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:50.240
 But you know, it’s our fault Chad has a response to this 

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:03.340
 why? Why do you directly ban me when I have naked in my desk? You are jealous - 

00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:10.620
 Do you understand what I am talking about? She obviously has a death-free gold medal. 

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:16.840
 The gold medal has been hanging on her. That's why she has been playing the victim because she relied on this trick to get rid of many things and you know? 

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:23.420
 In that reality, this thing is not over yet. I swear to God that she is completely showing that no one can move to her. 

00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:25.100
 She said n-word 

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:25.680
 Why? ? ? 

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.380
 Black friends call each other 

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:30.340
 It’s like 

00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:32.260
 It’s a bit like calling your friend’s nephew 

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.340
 You know, Twitch has very strict rules. Many people often get ban because of these regulations. 

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.320
 You shouldn't do this or at least Twitch shouldn't be as harsh as a male reality master. 

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:46.680
 One of her audience told her to face this word and she responded 

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.660
 "You can't talk about this word again in the future." 

00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.760
 Good~喔~ 

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:57.180
 Ok, I have some black blood, so I don't understand why... Why do you want to tell me this? 

00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:00.180
 Ok, I don't know that I actually have 10% black blood, so I don't think I... 

00:12:01.380 --> 00:12:02.140
 whatever 

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:06.760
 I obviously don't know the right person to comment on this thing but say n-word in this content. 

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:13.460
 It doesn't seem to be very serious, but she then said, "I can say n-word because I have 10% black blood." 

00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:15.980
 Still speaking 

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:20.320
 The platform of Twitch has long been obviously biased towards female reality. 

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:27.300
 There is a guy responsible for the live broadcast, because this is expelled and Twitch also publicly stated 

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:30.000
 "Please pay attention to us and believe that we are very responsible" 

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.320
 I am not saying that I want Alinity to be ban, but the more I think about it. 

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.120
 The more I think this might be a good idea for her. 

00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.720
 If she does not want to apologize 

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:44.040
 If she keeps on keeping the situation worse, let her pause for a few days, at least 

00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:47.580
 Don't do anything you have done, because it won't improve the situation. 

00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:49.960
 I think this is also a good opportunity for Twitch. 

00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:55.700
 Show that they have no bias on this platform and are fair to anyone 

00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:00.380
 If this is the case, it will be best to let the whole thing come to a successful conclusion. 

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:05.060
 Then everyone can let go of this because I believe it or not, but I don’t want to let this happen again. 

00:13:05.140 --> 00:13:09.280
 I haven’t tried to bring any wind, just like this, goodbye. 

00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:12.240
