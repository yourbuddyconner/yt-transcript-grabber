00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.010
 This video is in 3D. 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.429
 Yes really. 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:08.060
 If you only cover your right eye with sunglasses, 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:09.589
 you can see a 3D effect. 

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:12.712
 At least, if both your eyes work naturally. I'm sorry if that is not the case. 

00:00:12.712 --> 00:00:16.330
 The effect works best on a large, clear screen, 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.720
 in a bright environment, with dark sunglasses, 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.940
 and a device that plays in high frame rate. 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:26.270
 If you are lying in bed and looking at your phone at arm's length with your eyes half-closed, it probably will not work. 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.730
 That also looks ridiculous. 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.029
 Ordinary 3D video works by sending a different image to both eyes. 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.150
 These two simultaneous images, one for the left eye, one for the right, 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.790
 are called a stereo pair. 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.210
 This imitates what you would see with two eyes. 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:44.200
 You show two images at the same time on the same screen, 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.820
 and uses a filter to show one of the two to each eye. 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.020
 This can be done with a red and blue image and color filters, 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.000
 or exotic techno-glasses where every lens becomes opaque 60 times per second, 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.790
 or, in modern cinemas, with glasses that filter polarized light. 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.460
 But because there are two separate images on the screen at the same time, 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.470
 it is a confusing lot when you are not wearing glasses. 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.570
 But this video also works like a normal 2D video, 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.670
 because of the so-called Pulfrich effect, 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.450
 named after the German optician Carl Pulfrich who first described it at the beginning of the 20th century. 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.810
 Your eyes and your brain take a little longer to process dark images than light ones. 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.960
 How much longer exactly depends on the relative brightness of the images, 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.130
 but it is usually about the duration of one video image. 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:37.210
 It's quite useful for something that was first noticed almost a century ago. 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.979
 If you cover your right eye with dark glasses, the image is seen from that eye ... 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.640
 with about one frame delayed on the way to your brain. 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.950
 Eventually you see two different images, with one frame delay in between. 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.400
 However, that alone is not enough for creating a stereo pair. 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.350
 The second ingredient is the bizarre, nauseating moving camera. 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.720
 Because that camera has been constantly in motion, 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.300
 has your right eye delayed about one frame, 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.060
 just as if a second camera was just to the right of the first ... 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.840
 and sent a separate stereo image to your right eye. 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.970
 Now it is a stereo pair. 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.970
 If we stop the camera, the effect disappears ... 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.380
 and everyone can catch their breath. 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.810
 It also works by moving the objects in the frame. 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.670
 That is why the cutaways had a constantly moving background. 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:30.340
 Of course, the 3D effect is not perfect, 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.379
 but your brain fills in the rest. 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:35.800
 The Pulfrich effect works well enough to occasionally in TV programs ... 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.020
 and video games to be used. 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.580
 In the 1990s, the BBC broadcast a number of special 3D shows for a charity campaign, 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.200
 including one of the worst Dotor Who productions ever. 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.739
 - "Who is that horrible woman ?!" 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:48.810
 But if you look closely, you see that in every shot ... 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.310
 something in the foreground moves from left to right, 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.330
 and something in the background from right to left. 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.330
 All the time. 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.819
 Because every shot has to be carefully planned, and has to keep moving constantly ... 

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.200
 you will not soon see the Pulfrich effect applied in the cinema. 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:08.030
 It's just not practical for more than short gimmicks. 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.569
 Like this video. 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:12.180
 You can now take off the sunglasses. 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.540
 One take! One take! 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.160
 Wait, did I go in the right direction?
