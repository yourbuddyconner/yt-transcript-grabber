00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.909
 Sometimes I behave somewhat patriotically, sometimes pretending to be patriotic for comic reasons 

00:00:03.909 --> 00:00:04.930
 Sometimes I will be honest 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:05.730
 This is the honest time 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:09.920
 Because I strongly believe that the British socket is one of the best designs 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.530
 In the whole world 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:14.509
 For many reasons, I mean: there are safety features that most people, at least 

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:15.429
 In Britain they know it 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:19.939
 For example it is very difficult for a child to take a screwdriver 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.369
 Trying to get him into a hole 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.170
 For above, here is the earth (earth) or (karonde) among the Americans, this is for security 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.769
 The holes here are warm and cool, where the danger lies. But there is a fault 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.670
 On them. I can not "do not try to imitate me here" I can not insert the screwdriver in them 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.050
 right Now 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.000
 What I have to do is plug the ground pin - a bit longer - pin earth, here 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.110
 Firstly. When it enters, the gullies rise, allowing the remaining pins to enter 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.719
 Because this connection is poorly designed, I can 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.930
 Put the socket inverted and therefore when you look at these blocks while inserting the ground pin 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.469
 In this way you can now see open points for other pins 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.460
 Thus you need a very genius child capable of doing so 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.850
 And is subjected to electric shock .. So it is excellent security 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.520
 What if we inserted the socket completely? 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.540
 Because the US and European plugs when they are not fully inserted will have open electricity 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.640
 Which can be touched if you put your finger in that area 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.140
 Well .. not here 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.710
 Because hot (neutral) and cold pins are found at the bottom, insulators extend to the middle 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.530
 If the socket is inserted enough to connect the electricity 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.180
 So 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.240
 All you can touch is condoms 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.570
 Well ... so this is clearly a security feature 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.400
 What about inside? 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:43.680
 It must be remembered that until 1992 the British government did not require the existence of plugs 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.939
 In electrical appliances .. If you bought a toaster or washing machine 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.840
 You will get a bare wire just behind the machine 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.560
 You are asked to connect the plug yourself 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.420
 So we learned in school how to plug plugs because it was a skill required to learn at the time 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.979
 When open the socket 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.390
 First there is a fuse (fuse) and this is an old thing that goes back to after the Second World War 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:14.170
 There was a shortage of copper and it was much cheaper to install a fuse in each socket and it was built 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.770
 The circuit in one loop rotates on the entire house 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.050
 Instead of a lot of copper wires spin everywhere and fuse for each wire 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:27.930
 Therefore, it was approved to build a huge circle in each house and put a fuse in the socket itself and thus more increase in safety 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.470
 Then we come to the three wires 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.099
 Blue (cool or neutral) to the left 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.940
 Brown (hot or alive) to the right 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.819
 You can also remember that warm is brown because this will be the color of your coat 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.750
 When exposed to electric shock of this wire 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.660
 Finally, this wire is green and yellow, which is the earth (ground) 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.700
 In normal cases it is not used but it is essentially a back-line if an error occurs 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.200
 If Shi got my electric plug inside the socket or inside the device ... this wire 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.409
 Electricity will be kept away from people 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:05.040
 Because if this ground wire was cut off and there was a problem ... well ... you could touch the iron surface 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.250
 For the toaster the electricity will pass to earth on your way and through your heart 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.640
 This is bad 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.879
 So we have this wire and here we have very clever design 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:15.900
 Most people do not know anything about it 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.440
 Do you notice that the wire is slightly longer than the other wires? In case of wire tightening 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.790
 The pins were extracted from their places. Hot and cold wires 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.569
 They are the wires where the danger lies first 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.730
 Followed by the ground wire 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.099
 If the earth wire is damaged, it will be security 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.409
 No one will be hurt 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:43.819
 Here, the British Socket is truly one of the best designs I have ever had 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:47.879
 With one exception which is when you throw it to the ground 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.090
 If not in use 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.360
 Pins are mostly going to be up and that means 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:59.959
 At midnight when you step in it will be very painful 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.409
 You can also remember that warm is brown because that is the color of your coat 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:08.409
 When exposed to an electric shock of this wire, green wire and ... 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:10.720
 Are you fine?? 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.360
 (Laughs) I did not expect to say it 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.540
 No one can expect that 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.060
