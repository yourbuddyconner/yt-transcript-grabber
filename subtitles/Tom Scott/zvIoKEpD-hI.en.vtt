00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.399
 I'm in Iceland. She is here as beautifully beautiful, 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:07.149
 so cold, but it's also a good place to go 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:10.240
 you can learn something new about the names. In particular, 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.580
 as many world names, perhaps even most, 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.539
 does not fit into the English system of names that your parents will give you 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:21.560
 and then the names you inherit from your parents. Here in Iceland, 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.859
 for example, our idea of ​​a family name, 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:28.420
 which is inherited from generation to generation, is completely out of the question. 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:31.470
 It's rare at best. Instead, kids 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.700
 receive the first name of their parents, to which the "daughter" or "son" is added. 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.100
 Which, of course, makes the Icelandic phone list a bit complicated: you have to 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.719
 sort by the first name and the occupation, because it exists as a whole 

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.120
 so few surnames. And if it sounds weird, try to remember everyone 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.010
 your acquaintances, whose surnames are 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.309
 Thomson or Davidson or Peterson or Jameson. 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.800
 Each is created by the Icelandic system, which used to be the English system, 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.910
 it just turned into a surname. 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.420
 And then all people who do not use their official name. Technically I do not use it, my official name is 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.410
 Thomas Scott, 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.640
 but I use Tom. Add people who use your second first name, 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:15.460
 or who use a nickname or who simply use a different name 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.390
 for some other reason. Then you have cultures that give your surname 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.610
 to the first place, which is always confusing in translation 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.200
 into English. Which reminds me of one advice. 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.500
 If you ask for people's names, either in hard copy or online, 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.320
 do not ask for the first [= first name] and surname. Do not put there - this is the worst- 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.579
 first name and surname. Just make a check box, 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.720
 where to write, and ask what their names are. 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.299
 And for bonus points, then ask them how they want to be addressed, 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:51.300
 because, well, if you want to be friends, it is good to know their name. 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.400
