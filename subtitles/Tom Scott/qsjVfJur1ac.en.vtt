00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:03.489
 Welcome back to the "Battle of War" finals 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:07.350
 Unbeaten Myth - Game Designer Hannah Nicklin 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.240
 Queen of the resurrection of the defeated division - game player Emma Blackery (continued to win after the first round lost) 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.749
 (The first round lost and continued to win back) 

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:16.730
 The winner will get a cheap trophy, and the loser will go back empty-handed. 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.490
 Who is the final winner? Let our game continue... What is it today? 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.740
 Law and chaos 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.820
 This is an interesting strategy game, pure strategy game 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.960
 David: Simple strategy game Tom: This test is wisdom, not character. 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.820
 So who is the first attack? 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.640
 Ok, uh... I choose the orderly camp. 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.880
 If I am, I will also choose the order. 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.840
 Emma: I understand what you understand! Hannah: You know what I understand! 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.149
 Since Emma chose to be orderly, she would use five pieces of the same color to form a line. 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:48.520
 Red or blue can be used 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.170
 Just connect a line on the board 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.600
 And Hannah naturally became a chaotic camp. 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.620
 What she has to do is stop Emma from winning. 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.550
 She can try to fill the board 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.200
 Let Emma not connect smoothly into a line 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.869
 Tom: Ok~ David: Emma put a blue piece 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:08.020
 So Hannah would never want to put the red pieces there. 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.549
 Because that means no matter what the next round 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.710
 Will cause two blue or two red connections 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.760
 That's right. And when even three or four and both ends are unblocked 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.310
 The situation becomes very dangerous 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.400
 That's right. In fact, when the four and the two ends are unblocked, the game is over. 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.200
 As a part of the chaotic camp, when you see the connected ends 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.650
 Don't hesitate~ Block it right! 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.310
 Even when it’s even two, it’s very dangerous. 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.110
 Slowly, it will become dangerous slowly 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.900
 Although this is my first step, but 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.409
 I have been wondering if there is any way to occupy the edge in the early stage. 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:45.070
 If you want to do that, put a different colored piece next to the other side. 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.259
 Although this trick is not bad, it seems a bit dysfunctional. 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.659
 But at least not directly on the diagonal 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:59.650
 There is a chance to even five, but she... 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.479
 Oh, she went to plug it up. 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.090
 If I am Emma, ​​I will put it here, I feel more likely. 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.820
 Create a connection 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.400
 Tom: And she did it like David: Yes. 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.170
 This game is hard to understand! 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.099
 You have to remember that you can use two colors. 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.459
 Yes, unlike most games, one is red, the other is blue. 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.030
 This is a lot harder than I thought. 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.220
 After playing, I found out that this game is not easy. 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.280
 I now feel that the lawful side is more difficult. 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.790
 My biggest mistake is just that I accidentally helped you connect a red line. 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.230
 But I don't think it matters. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.200
 So hard 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.669
 so hard! 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.120
 I just wanted to say that Hannah must stop here, but 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.900
 There are many possible connections in other places. 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.410
 If she put it there, she will become a red line. 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:56.140
 That's right, it's very interesting that you might create another line after you blocked this line. 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.420
 This step is very stable 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.860
 Would it be beneficial to keep the same color all the time? 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.040
 No, Steven is not good. 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.640
 Is there a bright spot in that step? 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.390
 Just Hannah doesn’t need to stop it. 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.599
 Yes, because even if Emma is connected in the middle four (oblique, top left and bottom right) 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:20.440
 Hannah can also be easily blocked, so... 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.819
 Not dangerous, because it is not the case on both sides. 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.620
 It’s still too late to go to the situation like this. 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.030
 Blocked in this line with the opportunity to connect four 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.480
 Or another battlefield to block other opportunities to develop into 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.540
 The connection is correct. 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.080
 This step is a big deal. 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.379
 I mean, the trophies are already engraved. 

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:41.090
 Emma: You are tempted to mix the water! Steven: Oh. 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.440
 Now is not the time to block the middle may be connected 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.470
 Because you look, it has not yet formed 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.030
 Putting it there is really a step, because it will 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.310
 Form the pressure source behind you on the other two sides 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.830
 This one of the horizontal one has a straight one. 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:56.260
 David: So don't, no! Tom: No! 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.569
 Tom: If you put it... David: Put the other side! 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.640
 If you put it there, it is equal to helping the red to open the soil. 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.540
 David: No... Ah! Tom: I don’t have a big husband. 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.769
 David: Ok, that... Tom: It’s dangerous, it’s dangerous. 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.709
 If Emma is here, I will get a live three, and Hannah will have to block it. 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.400
 But that also created another piece that is about to form a living four. 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.949
 Yes, this is mandatory passive* 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.559
 If, if Emma noticed 

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:28.219
 Have! She noticed, and it was there, so Hannah had to stop. 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.460
 Hannah: I have to stop here, wait, oh~ 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:36.999
 She has no choice! The trend has gone, it is Emma winning! 

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:39.770
 Tom: Because she must go to stop the live three. David: Yes. 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.490
 So Emma will have a live four, then the game is over! 

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:45.360
 (This is an important moment) 

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.780
 It’s really "scare scare" 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.820
 It’s over! It's over, the game is over! 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:05.369
 I am coming to the awards! 

00:05:05.369 --> 00:05:07.949
 Hey~ Where do I put it next? ! 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:10.779
 Oh my god, I actually won! 

00:05:10.779 --> 00:05:12.229
 You, where do you want me to put? 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:13.189
 Emma: Anyway, it's all right! Hannah: Are you sure? 

00:05:13.189 --> 00:05:14.889
 Feel free to let you go! 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.520
 It’s good to end this game! 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.220
 water! (Taiwanese) 

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.380
 The old lady finally stopped doing nothing! ! 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:27.580
 Tom: Congratulations, this is your trophy! Emma: I finally got a cheap trophy! 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.180
 Emma: I finally won! Tom: Emma Blackery Congratulations on your victory in the "war" 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.100
 I have never won anything to say! 

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.099
