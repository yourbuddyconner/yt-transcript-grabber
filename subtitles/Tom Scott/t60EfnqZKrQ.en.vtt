00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.139
 I'm here with Kate Oliver and Andy Collins 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:04.620
 from the Faculty of Functional Nanomaterials at the University of Bristol 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.790
 and they are going to show me how we see very, very, very small things. 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.049
 KATE: So, we are nanotechnologists, and for us an atom is a small thing. 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:13.910
 TOM: I agree, okay. 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.860
 So, we look at atoms in our way 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.330
 called 'scanning tunneling microscope'. 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.660
 and it uses the fact that, if you bring a point close enough to a surface, 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.699
 then there is a chance that due to quantum - 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.810
 TOM: I love that explanation. 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.320
 KATE: - the descriptions will end up on the tip via the surface. 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.070
 Actually, when you move the tip, 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.899
 and when you hit something, more electrons will be tunnelled through the tip. 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.660
 And that will give you an idea of ​​how close the surface is. 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.750
 TOM: But that means you need a point with a width of one atom. 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.800
 KATE: It means that the point must be very narrow. 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.859
 TOM: Okay, here you come into the story. 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.449
 ANDY: So, I'm going to show you how to make a point with a thickness of one atom. 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.039
 It must be as sharp as possible to obtain a good image. 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.039
 We have a secret nanoscience weapon: 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:55.579
 Pliers. And cutting pliers. 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:57.180
 TOM: I already thought that there was something 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.519
 terrible expensive equipment was needed, but ... 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.399
 ANDY: I have some platinum wire here. 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.309
 TOM: OK, that's terribly expensive. 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.340
 ANDY: It is a platinum iridium alloy. 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.570
 And we use platinum so that it does not conduct oxygen 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:10.990
 which would make the point thicker. 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.040
 Because we want a single, conductive atom on the surface of the point. 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.030
 So, if I hold this wire with my pliers 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.650
 and I cut the wire at a 45-degree angle ... 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.450
 ... voilà! 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.540
 That means you have something that is - in theory - atomic screen. 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.229
 TOM: That's fantastic! So what do if it is not conductive? 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.979
 Because quantum tunneling only works with something that is conductive. 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.640
 KATE: This is an atomic force microscope. 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.229
 TOM: That's really cool! And is it really scanning now? 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:44.229
 KATE: Indeed. You can see it here on the screen, that is - 20 micrometer diameter. 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.090
 That is a fifth of the width of your hair, Tom. 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.450
 But we would not be able to see anything here 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.290
 if it was not against a flat, high-contrast background. 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.680
 Fortunately, we have a number of minerals that are supplied in user-friendly flat sheets. 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.619
 One of these sheets is mica, which I have here. 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.689
 But we can not be sure that we only have a single layer on the surface. 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:09.170
 So that's why we have another high-tech, nanoscientific tool. 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.800
 TOM: Adhesive tape. 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.580
 KATE: Yes. 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.550
 Stick this. 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.530
 And it holds just one of these layers of mica, or a pair. 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.360
 TOM: Only the top layers? 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.090
 KATE: Yes. 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.690
 And then: peel it off, and can you see the vague outline? 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.340
 TOM: There it is. There is a vague outline of a square. 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.810
 Is that - is that a layer of mica of just one atom thick? 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.090
 KATE: Japanese. And that implies that what is left is also completely flat. 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.590
 This gives us a very good contrast for any atom, molecule, species - 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.340
 these are a few fibers on the top of this surface - 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.530
 what we will look at and see what use they can have for us. 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.530
 TOM: So here we have a million pounds of equipment in this lab. 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.860
 And then we have tongs and tape. 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.430
 ANDY: Yes. 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.780
 TOM: That's incredible. Kate Oliver, Andy Collins, 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.700
 from the Faculty of Functional Nanomaterials at the University of Bristol. 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.810
 Thank you very much!
