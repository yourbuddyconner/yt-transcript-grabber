00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.299
 This is the Temple's mouth. It's a busy business trip, 

00:00:03.299 --> 00:00:06.839
 which use both small and large cargo ships. 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.830
 It combines London docks and the Channel Channel. 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:12.969
 Above it is the approach zone for part of the London air traffic. 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.270
 But over there, two miles from the bank right in the middle of the mouth, 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.790
 is a thousand and four hundred tons of unexploded bombs. 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.710
 In 1944, SS Richard Montgomery was carrying ammunition for the US Air Force. 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.950
 Here she docked for the night. 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.010
 And then the combination of bad weather and bad decisions caused, 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.970
 she was stuck in the sandy shallow waters. 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.230
 The weight of the ship ripped it in half 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.480
 and so it is still there. 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.469
 The stream around it is a small crater. 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.620
 Part of the cargo has been removed, but that is not enough. 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.620
 If it gets worse, it would be one of the biggest non-nuclear explosions in history. 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.449
 And that's what I mean. For comparison: Russia has tried something, 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.199
 what is called the Bomb Father? 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.469
 Its explosion is equivalent to 40 TNTs. 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.390
 This ship would explode with thirty-fold strength. 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.620
 Of course, it's around a banned entrance zone, 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.159
 indicated in the maps and recorded at the office. 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:06.270
 Occasionally, a jerk decides to go to her and take a shot there. 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.420
 But hand to heart if the blast did not cause years of storms and soil movements, 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.910
 so one photo probably will not hurt. 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.030
 So what's the risk? Well, no one is completely sure. That is the problem. 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.380
 No one knows what the state of the ship is. 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.750
 And there is no study that would answer the question of what the seas will do with bombs in half a century. 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:26.790
 They should be fine. They are in clean, cold water. 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.530
 And although TNT itself does not disintegrate in time, 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.470
 its detonators yes. That would be completely safe, 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.590
 if there were not two and a half thousand cluster bombs on it, 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.390
 which could fall on it. 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.750
 This could unexpectedly explode, 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.100
 even if they are not triggered. 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.030
 Maybe. Depending on who you believe. 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.120
 Should we have something to do against it? 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.740
 The Coast Guard, together with the wreck manager, 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.070
 a beautifully named function of the British Government, 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.300
 report to the public on the condition of the ship, 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.130
 based on laser scanning and occasional dives to the ship. 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.340
 The overall view is that it is safe, 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.640
 but gradually the ship decomposes, because the flow of water and time take their toll. 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.379
 It is probably best not to do anything. Because trying to remove it 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.230
 all the dangerous material could 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.010
 to be a much bigger part of life. 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.870
 And it would be very expensive. But even if the explosion occurred, 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.269
 water would probably absorb most of the energy. But no one is sure. 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.620
 Of course, there are many voices, 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.209
 mostly from people living near the ship, 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.049
 who say the risk is too big to stay here. 

00:02:30.049 --> 00:02:32.549
 The worst possibility is that a sudden wave 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:35.349
 heading for the wrong place in the wrong time will hit the ship 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:40.599
 and the equivalent of a small atomic bomb will explode. The cities around it would be aligned with the ground 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:42.739
 together with a nearby liquefied gas stock. 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.849
 First, a pressure wave and then a direct wave of explosion energy. 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.980
 But this ship is not only interesting due to its cargo. 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.200
 It's interesting because of its inscrutability. 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.150
 There are many such risky objects around the world. 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.629
 But we can usually tell how dangerous they are. 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:55.780
 We can determine the degree of risk, perhaps one in a million. 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.529
 But this risk can not be quantified. 

00:02:59.529 --> 00:03:01.389
 We can not say anything but: 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.219
 "Yeah, that'll be fine." 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:05.760
 Doing nothing is probably the right thing to do. 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.790
 And that's the only thing our government will do. 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.209
 But we do not know for sure if this is the right thing. 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:15.590
 The only way to find out is simply to wait. 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.900
 And maybe get a good insurance. 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.860
 "Small, far! Small, far!" 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.639
 "Tet of Father Ted, check it out." 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.071
