00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.980
 MATT: My department is Matt Parker. 

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:01.940
 TOM: I am Tom Scott. 

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:03.780
 I am at home in King's Cross subway station. 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.600
 5:30, the busiest time to become a subway network 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.620
 MATT: I am going to go to the side. 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.060
 And the system is so loud that it’s a big talk on the London Underground. 

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.500
 TOM: Everyone knows that the London subway map is distorted reality. 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.850
 For a long time, it’s accurate, but the system is always 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.760
 I followed the map and took the subway from Lancaster Gate to Paddington. 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.340
 MATT: I just went to the destination on the ground. 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.000
 -- Go to hell! --- Oh! 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.460
 TOM: I have to talk first. 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.320
 Waiting for the moon 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.540
 Take two stops after getting on the bus 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:27.020
 Then drop the car 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.020
 Take a long road and go up the stairs 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.000
 Another bus waiting for another platform 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.020
 Get on the bus and take two stops 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.350
 Forced to pass the Paddington station 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.539
 Use 咗 15 minutes first 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:37.399
 MATT: Everyone has a map of the ground. 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:39.469
 Tom is actually taking a big circle. 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.960
 There is actually only two steps between the two stations. 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.000
 I am so proud of it. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.060
 -- Go to hell! --- Oh! MATT: I am comfortable taking five minutes. 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.239
 Walking through the streets of London 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.780
 One mosquito is driving 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.019
 Go to Paddington Station and have time 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:53.760
 Drinking a cup of tea, screaming dead Tom 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.960
 TOM: I am top... I really thought I would win. 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.569
 TOM: The London Underground has more hidden words. 

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:01.559
 Bank station is crowded every time 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.580
 To live in one direction 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.020
 In the evening, I will change to the opposite direction. 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.600
 So the sign is followed by the arrow 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.350
 MATT: According to the BBC program "The Tube" 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.220
 Sometimes subway staff will call passengers 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.040
 Swim a big garden 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.480
咁 will make the channel slow down 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.340
 Avoid them in danger and bury them 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.660
 At the same time, it will make anyone unhappy. 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.500
 TOM: But I have explained the situation of King's Cross. 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.160
 On the Victoria Line, I will follow the signs to take the train. 

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.720
 MATT: I will go to the fine noodles. 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.670
 I just stayed at the exit of the Euston Road exit line. 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.780
 TOM: When Matt uses his generous "inside information" at the same time 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.440
 I am going to force the platform to hold the bank. 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.310
 Row of stairs 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.820
 Zhong has to go through one long tunnel 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.250
 It seems like never ending 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.490
 Pass through the new north lobby 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.680
 Then enter King's Cross Station 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.020
 Finally, after five minutes, I will meet Matt. 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.480
 TOM: I have to make shortcuts in the future! 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.280
 MATT: Do you know me first? 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.460
 Because I only need it 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.690
 Take the elevator to the ground 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.220
喺Outline for one minute 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:53.310
 I will go to La 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.870
 Go to the train station entrance in about half the time 

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:57.250
 Listening to the fall is like a lot of 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.840
 But if you want to catch the train 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.090
 There will be great differences in less time. 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.160
 The problem is, if all of them are like me 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.450
 It will make a lot of people bury them in abundance. 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.940
 As a result, everyone is slow. 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.660
 TOM: The design of the railway system 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.300
 When you are in a hurry, make everyone happy as a whole. 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.440
 There used to be a wise man who told me 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.140
 "The needs of everyone are more important than personal needs" 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.100
 It’s just a matter of ordering the London Underground to marry you. 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.740
