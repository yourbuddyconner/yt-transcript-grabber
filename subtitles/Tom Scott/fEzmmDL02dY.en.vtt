00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:04.420
So you've never actually been to Scarborough then?

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.760
- No, no. I've never been here. What's the choice? Where do we go?

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.290
- Well you've got the North Bay, the South
Bay, or the Michael Bay.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.410
- Right.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.700
- North Bay, generally quite quiet, Sea
Life Centre, nice little park there.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:16.220
- Mhmm.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.580
- South Bay, you're talking ice creams,
penny slot machines, donkey rides, that kind of thing.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.680
The Michael Bay which is run by the guy who did Transformers.

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:25.580
- Right.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.660
- So you've got big robots, large explosions, scantily-clad women, and American flags all over the place.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.800
Which one do you fancy?

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.980
- Uh, let's go with the South Bay, I want to play Time Crisis.

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:43.519
I'm gonna put this in the bin.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.020
- Fair enough.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:46.620
I'm just gonna keep an eye on those two seagulls.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.360
- The Decepticons are coming!

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.460
- Next beach over, mate.

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.080
- Cheers!
