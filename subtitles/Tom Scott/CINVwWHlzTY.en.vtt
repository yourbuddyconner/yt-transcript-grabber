00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.400
 There has been a lot of talk about whether the British government will force 

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:07.340
 companies, such as WhatsApp, to make a back entrance into their encryption system, 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.960
 So the police and government can read your messages, it should be necessary 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:13.820
 At the time of the recording, they have not yet done so. 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.170
 But laws that could let them do it in the future are already there. 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.560
 And here is something you might not have thought I would say: 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.560
 It sounds like a sensible idea. 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.540
 The Basal 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.700
 Back doors have been allowed for old-fashioned phone calls for decades. 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:31.860
 They are called interceptions. 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.239
 And if a criminal investigation has enough documentation for a warrant, 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.260
 so they can look in your mail, 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.610
 they can listen to your phone calls, 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.260
 and they can intercept your text messages 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.620
 It's called "wiretaps" in English, because the police many years ago 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.280
 Literally would put a device into a physical telephone line. 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.020
 So for anyone who grew up knowing this, 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.649
 anyone who has grown up with computers like this, 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.129
 just like just about every politician in the government, 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.850
 Well, then it seems reasonable that there should also include - for example - WhatsApp. 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.480
 So why not? 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.239
 Well, first, let's look at the technical details. 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.590
 It all depends on who holds the keys. 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.220
 Modern encryption uses complicated mathematics 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.960
 it is easy for a computer to calculate one way, 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.270
 but almost impossible for it, the other way. 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.430
 A really simple example: 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.689
 If I ask you to multiply two prime numbers, like 13 × 17, 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.490
 You can do this by just pressing a few keys on your calculator. 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.220
 And because they were prime numbers, 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.340
 We know this is the only way to get 221 by multiplying two whole numbers together. 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.860
 except 221 times 1, and it's not quite useful. 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.470
 But if I ask you, "Which two prime numbers should be multiplied to get 161?" 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.160
 There is no way to find out quickly. 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.079
 There are a few shortcuts you can take, 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.079
 But it is still basically a brute-force approach. 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.500
 Now imagine you're not trying to calculate for 161, 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.250
 but instead something like this ... 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.070
 you begin to see the scale of the problem. 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.900
 And that's just a simple example, 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.600
 Modern cryptography uses far more complicated one-way operations. 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.340
 The important thing is that you can get a computer to do maths that are single-way, 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:05.030
 but could take longer than the lifetime of the universe to brute-force back. 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.110
 The result is that you can have two keys: two huge numbers. 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.410
 One public, one private. 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.090
 You send your public key to the world. 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.810
 Anyone can encrypt a message with it; 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.670
 the message is converted to what looks like random noise. 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.850
 Even the same public key cannot convert it back. 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.020
 But you can take the noise and use your private key 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.920
 - and only your private key - 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:24.920
 to decrypt it. 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.620
 When you want to send a message back, you use their public key, 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.560
 and they use their private key to decrypt it. 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.760
 And the beautiful part of this: there is no need to exchange keys in advance, 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.230
 You don't have to work out old-school disposable pads, or anything like that. 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.220
 You can send your public key to the internet for anyone to see. 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.750
 As long as you keep the private key secret, 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.950
 no one else can read your messages. 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.050
 It's a system that has been tested under incredibly harsh conditions for decades. 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.160
 It works. 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.030
 The chin knows it's really unfriendly to use. 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.310
 It's hard enough to get someone to join a new bedding service as it is, 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.160
 not to talk about getting their friends along. 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.460
 Now you have to generate strange key hallucinations too? 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.100
 And if you lose your phone or otherwise forget the key, 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.350
 or your hard drive breaks down and you are without a backup, 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:10.230
 are all your messages gone, lost as random noise forever. 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.220
 E-mail that works this way has been around for decades 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.060
 But it is too complicated and it is too unfriendly for most people. 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.480
 The security was not worth the effort. 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.810
 So instead, let web mail services, 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:22.370
 along with Facebook, Twitter, and everyone else, 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:23.370
 Don't worry about it. 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.100
 Previously, they were mostly unencrypted, 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.180
 but quickly realized that was a bad idea - 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.300
 so now they use regular web encryption, 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.920
 the padlock on your browser, 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.750
 to make sure nobody on your network can see 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:36.030
 your password or messages when they are underway 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.850
 And that is the threat most people care about. 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.910
 But they have the contents of the plain text messages, 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.040
 or something close to it, 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.550
 And these companies can give it back to you whenever you want. 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:48.700
 Which means that when a government comes with a warrant, 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.100
 companies can also provide the messages to them. 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.640
 And that was fine, right? 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.640
 This was reasonable. 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.230
 This was an acceptable compromise between security and ease of use. 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:02.150
 Or at least it was until it was revealed that - in short - 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:06.430
 all major governments have a copy of virtually everything everyone has ever written; 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.020
 at what time there were a few companies that decided that they actually 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:13.250
 did not want to take the risk that anywhere - not even their own employees - 

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:18.400
 Even theoretically, should be able to access messages that people sent. 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.050
 The result is WhatsApp, and iMessage, and the many smaller apps like them. 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:25.690
 They have "end-to-end encryption". 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.680
 Your phone automatically generates a public and private key for you. 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.050
 It exchanges public keys behind the scenes, 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:33.650
 while writing your first message to someone 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.190
 and everything is encrypted. 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.190
 And all of it automatically! 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.010
 But WhatsApp and iMessage are not open source, 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.940
 so hypothetically they could steal your private key too 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.750
 or quietly issue a fake one to a person and sit in the middle listening, 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.890
 But in practice people would notice. 

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:49.530
 There are certainly small loopholes that could work under special circumstances 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:52.980
 But the odds are small and security experts are already 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:57.820
 In the process of separating each and every edition of each messaging program, you go to it 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.390
 just to see if anyone has put a back door into it. 

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.620
 Shortly said: 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.890
 if any of these apps are served a warrant right now, 

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:08.370
 is the most they could say, how much two people have spoken, 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.410
 and maybe roughly where they were: 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.370
 But never what they were talking about. 

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:16.310
 More than that is literally, mathematically impossible. 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:19.180
 But it is impossible only because of the way they have designed their systems. 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.970
 And that's the vulnerability. 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.760
 A government could make it a legal requirement for Apple and Facebook 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.000
 that they should quietly add a back door in all their encryption 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.240
 if they want to sell something in their country. 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.450
 I have heard this wording as "banning mathematics", 

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:34.090
 but it is a bit like saying that 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.740
 The ban on beating a stranger in the face is "to ban hands". 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.150
 And if Apple and Facebook refuse to add a back door, a government could ... 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.830
 ... theoretically, they could ban their phones or ban their apps from sale, 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.510
 or prosecute those responsible 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.880
 or block Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.410
 or they could make ISPs block their services, 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:53.610
 or they could ... 

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.480
 ... in practice, they will pay fines to the company. 

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.320
 Apple and Facebook have local addresses, 

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:00.500
 They pay ... little treasure. 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:02.830
 From the sidelines, I would love to see the British government 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.970
 Go up to Apple and see who flashed first. 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:09.310
 But companies have bowed to foreign countries many times before. 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:10.730
 BlackBerry left the Indian government 

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:15.050
 Get full access to users' chat and web history back in 2013. 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.290
 The only reason WhatsApp can't read your messages 

00:06:17.290 --> 00:06:21.550
 is that they have deliberately chosen to design their systems that way. 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.260
 They were just as popular without encryption: 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.260
 it was a reflection, 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.660
 They had been running for years before they turned on encryption. 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:29.840
 This was a human decision, 

00:06:29.840 --> 00:06:33.139
 not an inevitable fact of technology. 

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:36.260
 So why is an encryption backdoor such a bad idea? 

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:40.100
 Well, if there is a back door, it can and will be abused. 

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.420
 Local UK authorities have already used our monitoring laws, 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:45.090
 - those who were made to stop terrorism, 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:47.300
 to monitor loudly the doggie, 

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:48.900
 strike down illegal feeding of pigeons, 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.630
 and spying on some parents to see if they actually lived near enough 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.920
 to a particular school they wanted to get their children in. 

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.120
 Now is it useful for crime prevention? 

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.120
 Of course. 

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:59.120
 And there is the argument that 

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.050
 "If you have something to hide, you have nothing to fear": 

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:03.950
 Perhaps they should not have illegally fed these pigeons. 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:08.260
 And yes, you see this, you probably have nothing to hide and nothing to fear 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:11.650
 from the current government of your country. 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:14.669
 But laws and governments are changing and, incidentally, 

00:07:14.669 --> 00:07:18.110
 is the internet and the apps we use on our phones global. 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.740
 If you allow a back door here, 

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:22.740
 you also allow another country's government to spy on its opponents, 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:25.710
 and another to spy on people they suspect might be gay, 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:27.200
 or using cannabis, 

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:28.200
 or who are Christians, 

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.270
 or depending on what is illegal in the country. 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:31.270
 In fifty years, 

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:33.740
 you may be part of a country where eating meat has been banned, 

00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.830
 and the government will want to come after you to track down 

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:41.810
 the illegal bacon ring your friends are a part of. 

00:07:41.810 --> 00:07:44.810
 "Nothing to hide" only works if people are in power 

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:48.430
 Share your and everyone you celebrate values ​​wholeheartedly 

00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:50.860
 and always want to. 

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.260
 To make matters worse: On the surface, this seems to be similar 

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.150
 for ordinary, old-fashioned phone tapping, but it's not: 

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.120
 depending on how the back door is set up, 

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.540
 A government may not just be able to get what someone has sent now. 

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:03.550
 They could get the whole message history. 

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.980
 Maybe years of messages back and forth 

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.140
 with hundreds or thousands of other people. 

00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:11.340
 It's not just a look into what a person says: 

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:15.260
 It is an overwhelming look into many, many people's thoughts. 

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:19.110
 That's what long forgotten nude image someone sent five years ago. 

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:23.770
 It's the angry style they wrote in school and with which they now disagree completely. 

00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:25.260
 It's not just "what do they say" 

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:28.199
 It is "what have they ever said". 

00:08:28.199 --> 00:08:33.229
 It is all under the assumption that the back door is not being abused by people with more personal problems. 

00:08:33.229 --> 00:08:35.010
 All it takes is one single employee, 

00:08:35.010 --> 00:08:37.060
 in the government or by the message app, 

00:08:37.060 --> 00:08:41.260
 And then we've got a huge amount of personal information leaked. 

00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.790
 Either about the general public 

00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:46.700
 or about concrete people who someone wants revenge on. 

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.640
 It dumps the "blunt-ex-test" 

00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.091
 Can a person with an agenda 

00:08:50.091 --> 00:08:51.430
 Use this to destroy a life? 

00:08:51.430 --> 00:08:54.150
 A press survey found hundreds of cases 

00:08:54.150 --> 00:08:56.790
 where police officers and civil servants in the US 

00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.760
 searched for private information for personal reasons. 

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.020
 And let's not start off what would happen if a hacker, 

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:05.500
 or even another government's intelligence service, 

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:07.390
 got access to the back door. 

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.190
 Or how it would make it much more risky 

00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.380
 to report abuse of government power, on any scale. 

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.780
 There is an argument that it would be worth it 

00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:18.130
 That all the downsides would be a small price to pay 

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:20.990
 to Stop Very Rare Bad Things. 

00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:24.920
 I disagree, but it is an opinion, not a fact. 

00:09:24.920 --> 00:09:27.850
 But an encryption backdoor would not stop bad things from happening. 

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.910
 The problem of stopping terrorism right now is not a lack of information. 

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.490
 The Manchester bomber was reported to authorities five times, 

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.100
 including his own friends and family. 

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:40.440
 An anonymous source from within the UK security services 

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.560
 told Reuters that at any given time, 500 people are being investigated 

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:47.250
 and about 3,000 people "of interest". 

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.870
 For scale, just to reassure you, 

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:51.529
 it is only about 0.005% of the British population. 

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:54.430
 But the way to solve this is no more data 

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.710
 It's having enough police officers and security personnel 

00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:59.540
 with enough time to do their jobs and investigate. 

00:09:59.540 --> 00:10:04.450
 And let's be clear: everyone who wants secure communication for evil purposes 

00:10:04.450 --> 00:10:06.220
 just wanted to use something else 

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:09.510
 Any of thousands of smaller services the government has not noticed yet 

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:12.160
 or that they could not possibly have jurisdiction over. 

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:13.850
 Or if even that is not an option, 

00:10:13.850 --> 00:10:16.300
 they can come up with a code themselves, 

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:19.890
 just own jokes and references that no one else understands. 

00:10:19.890 --> 00:10:24.070
 So when I say that an encryption back door sounds like a sensible idea, 

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.070
 I mean it. 

00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:26.720
 It sounds reasonable. 

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.839
 Like a lot of ideas sound reasonable when you express them in one or two sentences. 

00:10:30.839 --> 00:10:33.339
 But the devil is in the detail. 

00:10:33.339 --> 00:10:35.770
 If we could copy the way interceptions worked, 

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:37.580
 limited in scope and time, 

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:39.780
 demanding a warrant and some physical effort, 

00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.080
 and not the story of all that anyone ever said 

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:45.339
 and not available to repressive governments elsewhere in the world, 

00:10:45.339 --> 00:10:49.420
 So surely, I would definitely be for it. 

00:10:49.420 --> 00:10:52.040
 Making an encryption backdoor is not impossible: 

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:54.180
 But to build a sensible one is. 

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.100
 Thanks to everyone who helped with proofreading my script, 

00:10:57.100 --> 00:11:00.560
 and to everyone here at Cambridge Center for Computing History, 

00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.820
 who let me film with this wonderful old equipment.
