00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
 Behind these walls lie the Cross Reel, or at least one of the Cross Reel work sites. 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.680
 It is one of the largest engineering projects taking place in the world now. 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.900
 But I'm not here to talk about this, I'm here, to talk about how it looks, 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.180
 Because for decades now, every construction site in the world has had this sound. 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.480
 [buzz] 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.920
 I obviously added this sound to the product; it's the sound of the driver's back, and it's a truck that's not here to scare me. 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.900
 But in the last 10 years and more, increasingly you have heard a different voice instead. 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.240
 I began to hear this: 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:30.240
 High Hesice 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.920
 The voice of the command is white. 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:36.740
 This resulted from a discovery at Leeds University in 2001. 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:40.020
 Now it has become the norm for most major construction projects. 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.380
 An extension of this Cross Rail does not allow access to vehicles that have the old one-tone sound. 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.900
 So why did you say that? Because it is completely technical information you need to know. 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.700
 Well, there are two reasons. 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.700
 First, because it is safer. 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.480
 Your ears can capture the overall sound, the white sound more than the sound of the buzz. 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:08.380
 Which means you can play it low, so as not to disturb residents near here, and it is also safer. 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.520
 Because your ears can pick up the sound and tell you where it comes from. 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.640
 A single ring tone can do all kinds of echo, 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.400
 It is not a natural sound, your ears are not trained on it 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.500
 But the white sound, which is almost * bass * bass *, your mind can pick up the sound source. 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.880
 So if you have five trucks going back, you'll know where they are. 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.960
 You will know if one of them will hit you. 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.360
 This is something you may not have known. 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.060
