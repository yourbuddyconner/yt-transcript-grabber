00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.390
 There is an idea in literature called "hurtful sense" 

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.450
 The idea is that a look, a disgusting idea, a voice or a song can stay in your mind for a very long time 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.299
 And cause actual harm to you 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.900
 Away from this idea, there is something real that can get into your mind 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.800
 And change your thinking as soon as you look at it 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.960
 The effect is called "McCallie". Just a warning, I know that people news on the net 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.250
 They do nothing, like telling a 5-year-old boy not to put pistachio in his nose 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.290
 I'll put peanuts in his nose even if I tell him honestly, if you're doing texts or clips 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.660
 Do not do this ! 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.770
 The effect of "McClolly" revolves around these two images. If you stare at them for long enough 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.480
 I mean from 15 seconds to 15 minutes you'll see 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.870
 Possible, without colors, the opposite will come true in your mind 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.980
 If you watch green light for a long time, you will see the red color after that 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.359
 But this effect does not work at the level of the retina, a "mechanical" effect for some reason 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.260
 Works at the brain level 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.560
 If you see enough of these images on "15d", you see the opposite colors on these images 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.920
 Any time you see anything you like for a while 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.700
 May be up to three months 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.490
 The effect of "malki" is a rare and frightening thing, a real picture you can 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.090
 Enter your mind and influence how it works and stay so for a long time 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.360
 It's a really hurtful feeling, and that's a scary thing 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.860
 You may not be taught. 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.860
