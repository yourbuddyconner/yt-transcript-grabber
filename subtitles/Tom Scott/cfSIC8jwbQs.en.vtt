00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.320
 In 1648 the water board of Lekdijk Bovendams had to repair this dam 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.820
 to ensure that this part of the Netherlands is not overrun. 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:09.306
 They needed money for that, 

00:00:09.306 --> 00:00:11.311
 so they sold a bond. 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.420
 Whoever owned that bond would get a little money from them every year. 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.800
 But, unlike modern bonds, they had not set a time limit. 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.874
 Eternal debt can be a thing in finance. 

00:00:20.874 --> 00:00:23.120
 It's like you're selling a share in a company, 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.320
 but normal means "eternal": "until the company breaks down". 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:29.560
 But this company did not go broke. 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:33.736
 3.5 years later the original bond landed at ... 

00:00:35.741 --> 00:00:37.417
 GPS: "Take exit 47." 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.680
 ... here, at Yale University in New Haven, Conecticut, USA, 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.640
 and interest is still paid for. 

00:00:43.648 --> 00:00:46.715
 Eternal bonds date back to the Middle Ages. 

00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:48.928
 All bonds were eternal bonds 

00:00:48.928 --> 00:00:51.396
 and the fact that bonds really get older 

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:54.381
 and paying back the original investment is a financial innovation. 

00:00:54.381 --> 00:01:00.280
 River plains do not correspond to state or city boundaries, 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.420
 so there were separate governments to oversee the dikes. 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.600
 These organizations had the power to levy taxes. 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.145
 Everyone who was protected by a dike 

00:01:09.145 --> 00:01:12.976
 had to pay taxes to pay the maintenance. 

00:01:12.976 --> 00:01:14.406
 And they never had an earllog, 

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:17.500
 so the combination of tax can lift and not wage war - 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.420
 - where governments normally go bankrupt - 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.460
 ensures that interest is still paid for these bonds. 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.480
 Tax was sometimes too little to pay everything, 

00:01:25.482 --> 00:01:27.605
 so they released this bond. 

00:01:27.605 --> 00:01:31.532
 The water board, which I think goes back to 1328, 

00:01:31.532 --> 00:01:34.558
 is merged with ever larger organizations. 

00:01:34.558 --> 00:01:36.969
 They have merged all these water boards 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.740
 and now it is called Stichtse Rijnlanden, which still pays the interest for the bond. 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.793
 These markings are the annual interest payments 

00:01:44.793 --> 00:01:48.415
 that have been taking place since 1648. 

00:01:48.415 --> 00:01:51.076
 If you go to the other side, 

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:53.117
 you see that the whole back 

00:01:53.117 --> 00:01:55.372
 it is also covered with small markings, 

00:01:55.372 --> 00:01:56.806
 what the interest payments are 

00:01:56.806 --> 00:01:58.399
 that have been paid out over the years. 

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:00.038
 At some point the bond was full. 

00:02:00.038 --> 00:02:01.430
 There was no room left, 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.182
 and then they have released this piece of paper 

00:02:04.182 --> 00:02:07.003
 with even more markers for interest payments. 

00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:10.313
 When Yale bought the bond in 2003, 

00:02:10.313 --> 00:02:11.868
 and we collected our interest payment, 

00:02:11.868 --> 00:02:13.218
 you see that the last interest payment 

00:02:13.218 --> 00:02:15.956
 had taken place in 1976. 

00:02:15.956 --> 00:02:20.123
 So there was 27 years of interest that still had to be paid. 

00:02:20.127 --> 00:02:22.582
 We left the bond here for 12 years, 

00:02:22.582 --> 00:02:28.020
 and then, in 2015, we have 2004, 2005, 2006, 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:30.836
 collected up to 2015. 

00:02:30.836 --> 00:02:32.102
 There is a photo somewhere 

00:02:32.102 --> 00:02:35.701
 from me in the Netherlands, where I hold the bond in one hand 

00:02:35.701 --> 00:02:39.280
 and the interest payments for Yale in the other 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.140
 as the bearer of the bond. 

00:02:41.145 --> 00:02:42.416
 It is a bit disappointing. 

00:02:42.416 --> 00:02:46.583
 The bond was first worth 1000 karolus guilders. 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:49.480
 Karolus guilders became other guilders, I believe. 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.116
 They were again, now, euros. 

00:02:52.116 --> 00:02:55.636
 At a given moment they have adjusted the interest payments somewhat downwards. 

00:02:55.636 --> 00:02:57.512
 So, to make a long story short, 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.800
 we receive € 11.35 in interest for this bond every year. 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.414
 You know, the value of this bond 

00:03:04.414 --> 00:03:07.274
 is obviously the fact that he is still running. 

00:03:07.274 --> 00:03:08.912
 It is probably just as exciting for them 

00:03:08.912 --> 00:03:11.808
 as for us to show this bond 

00:03:11.808 --> 00:03:13.777
 and the possibility to pay interest. 

00:03:13.777 --> 00:03:15.875
 Dutch water boards could now probably file for bankruptcy 

00:03:15.875 --> 00:03:17.737
 on the debt, if they wanted to. 

00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:19.147
 It costs more than the bond is worth 

00:03:19.147 --> 00:03:21.813
 to let someone fly over every few decades. 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.360
 And let's face it, Yale probably would not start an international lawsuit. 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.020
 But, for € 1, - per month, 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:30.408
 the water boards are part of it 

00:03:30.408 --> 00:03:33.840
 from a strange piece of living financial history, 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.900
 and they also get good publicity in return. 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.240
 It may not be a subscription that they would take on purpose, 

00:03:39.248 --> 00:03:42.026
 but it is apparently worth it for them. 

00:03:42.026 --> 00:03:44.722
 I think they have a pretty good history. 

00:03:44.722 --> 00:03:47.486
 They sound like a triple-A company in my ears, 

00:03:47.486 --> 00:03:49.620
 and I think we're still having a good time together. 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.560
