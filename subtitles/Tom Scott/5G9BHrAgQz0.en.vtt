00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.749
 This is not an ordinary film, 

00:00:01.749 --> 00:00:07.630
 I am about 20 minutes from the boat back to the boat. 

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.080
 But I am currently on a hill in the town of Ilulissat, Greenland. 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.049
 And John, who works for Greenland Post, 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:22.789
 There is also my translation Jakob, who is still holding my microphone in his jacket! 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:28.840
 And the reason we came here is because this is the whole town. 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.769
 Or the only microwave relay station north of the town. 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.790
 And John is willing to answer a few questions. 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.940
 Hey, this is a bit rough movie! 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.579
 "The biggest packet that can be transmitted here is about 4 megabits." 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.079
 What is the upload speed here? 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:48.039
 "Well, about 0.7 megabits per second, 

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:51.960
 So it takes a long time to upload anything. 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.690
 There is a sight from the south to here. 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.780
 Along the mountains, all the way north 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.680
 So we should actually be able to see another relay tower. " 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.160
 Where is the next relay station? 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.859
 (Greenlandic) 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.860
 (Greenlandic) 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.540
 "Ah, I know, 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.870
 The next relay station is located here about 40 kilometers south of the Kasig River Gite. 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.200
 This link is constantly, 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.980
 But of course there may be some obstacles. " 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.360
 (Greenlandic) 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.500
 "There are actually interesting stories in the neighboring towns. 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.060
 Although it is only 8 kilometers away from here, it is blocked by a huge iceberg. 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.640
 So they didn't receive the internet this summer. 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.650
 But if there is a relay station in the south that is powered off, 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.300
 We may also break the network here. 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.310
 So one day before, there was no internet all day. 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.580
 It should be because the relay battery below is broken. 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:48.780
 If a relay station in the south breaks down, there is no signal in all places north. " 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.640
 (Greenlandic) 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:58.400
 "They can't pull the submarine cable through here because of the big icebergs, 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:01.810
 They dig all the way to the bottom of the sea, so next year 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.320
 They want to update the entire system, 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.820
 To lay a submarine cable from Nuuk all the way 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.680
 Go to Asiatic, about 120 kilometers in that direction. 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.980
 Then they will upgrade these base stations to provide high-speed transmission. 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.020
 Go to Umanek all the time. " 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:26.840
 (Greenlandic) 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.910
 "In winter, these antennas will be covered with ice and snow. 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.650
 Then they got it, oh..." 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.410
 John, thank you very much! 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:40.190
 Jakob thank you for helping me with the microphone! 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:41.320
 "You're welcome." 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:44.100
 This is not a normal movie. 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.490
 Let me turn the lens right, 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.490
 much better! 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.040
 This is really not the kind of film I usually do. 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.090
 Thank you Jakob, when he heard that I was coming here, 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.510
 Email me and ask if I want to shoot. 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.830
 Thank you! "You're welcome." 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.670
 Let me move the camera again, much better. 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.740
 thank you very much! 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.600
 Great! 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.960
 I am at Chris Hardfield's Arctic Generator Project, and he is here too! 

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.670
 My name is Tim Kellner and my YouTube channel is Tim to the Wild. 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.430
 I make a short film of the movie type. 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.990
 Go see their channel, and everyone in the project!
