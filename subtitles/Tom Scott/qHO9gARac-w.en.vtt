00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.590
 This is the Falkirk Wheel and it is one of the biggest examples of modern industrial design 

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:06.710
 in the world. 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.839
 At the top of the hill is the Union Canal and below is the Forth and Clyde Canal. 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:15.669
 And the traditional way to get boats from one channel to another was through a route of locks, which is about 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.860
 it took a day to get through and in addition they were dismantled here in the thirties. The solution: 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.120
 the world's only rotating boat lift. 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.480
 Now, ship lifts are not a new one. They have existed for centuries. Most of them, like 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.739
 these, have two caissons, the technical term for the bins in which the boats are, though 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.550
 they usually lie next to each other instead of rotating around a central point. And the 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.699
 reason for two is: to lift 500 tons 24 meters, you have at least 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:49.760
 32 kilowatt hours needed. That's about what an average British home uses in three 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.929
 days, or an average American house in one day. And that is even before taking friction into account, that is only 

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.729
 the potential energy needed to raise the system so far. But if 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:06.020
 you at the same time also let the same weight of water drop at the same rate, 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.090
 then you do not add any potential energy at all. On average nothing goes up or 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.259
 down. You only move a very heavy thing and stop it again. Therefore 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.119
 this wheel only needs one and a half kilowatt hours for lifting up: less than a twentieth 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:23.250
 of what it would otherwise need. 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.079
 There are even some ship lifts in the world that are fully powered by gravity, where the local conditions 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:34.100
 and architecture allows it: you just fill the upper one with a little more water, let it drain 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.020
 and then brake when necessary. A bit tricky with something like that 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.140
 if this. The construction has to be strengthened, there is an incredible amount of moment 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.090
 look at it. 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.770
 And the really smart part: remember the principle of Archimedes, the Greek guy with 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.929
 the bathtub. A floating object moves the same amount of water equal to its weight. An object 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:02:01.100
 that sinks naturally displaces just as much as its volume, but a floating object, like a boat, 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:06.219
 displaces as much water as its weight. When they are full of water, those caissons weigh 

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:12.349
 about 500 tons. If you add one to ten tons of floating boat, ten tons of water will flow 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:13.760
 into the channel. 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.810
 Which means that this is balanced, no matter how much actually floats in the water.
