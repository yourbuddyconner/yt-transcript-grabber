00:00:00.112 --> 00:00:02.120
 Behind me is HMS Defender. 

00:00:02.232 --> 00:00:04.416
 It's a new generation of royal ships. 

00:00:04.495 --> 00:00:06.695
 It's an amazing engineering effort. 

00:00:06.823 --> 00:00:10.329
 He is able to shoot a small dron at a distance of 40 km. 

00:00:10.397 --> 00:00:12.948
 It is capable of tracking up to 2,000 targets at a time. 

00:00:13.075 --> 00:00:16.630
 It's a destroyer who has himself and the rest of the fleet 

00:00:16.809 --> 00:00:20.157
 protect them by destroying the missiles before they get closer. 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.178
 It is the masterpiece of modern military engineering. 

00:00:31.945 --> 00:00:35.850
 She, like every ship, has a structural fault that you will not get rid of, 

00:00:35.946 --> 00:00:37.699
 when you're making something out of steel. 

00:00:37.798 --> 00:00:42.146
 If you place such a metal in a strong magnetic field, 

00:00:42.423 --> 00:00:46.045
 it begins to absorb some magnetism. 

00:00:46.173 --> 00:00:48.098
 It starts to deviate the compasses 

00:00:48.213 --> 00:00:51.414
 and attract magnetic mines. 

00:00:51.607 --> 00:00:54.107
 These were developed during World War II 

00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:57.258
 and should focus on all sources of magnetic signals, 

00:00:57.361 --> 00:00:59.822
 such as on ships that have some time on the water, 

00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:01.422
 and explode with them. 

00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:03.552
 Of course, we talk about sea mines. 

00:01:03.887 --> 00:01:06.105
 How can you defend yourself from them? 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.006
 Today, complex demagnetizing equipment is used on ships. 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.215
 But in the past, they were pulling a cable of 2,000 amperes in the past. 

00:01:16.346 --> 00:01:18.590
 Or they used giant demagnetizing coils, 

00:01:18.695 --> 00:01:20.468
 which were larger than the ship itself. 

00:01:20.646 --> 00:01:23.799
 They did the same thing, like CRT monitors. 

00:01:23.882 --> 00:01:25.846
 When you pressed the button, they did ... 

00:01:26.063 --> 00:01:27.631
 For a moment they were distorted. 

00:01:27.877 --> 00:01:29.991
 But what if you want to get closer to the mines? 

00:01:30.182 --> 00:01:33.335
 What if your ship's mission is to get rid of min? 

00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:37.189
 You have to get close to them, but do not run them. 

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:41.009
 Away downstream of Tower Bridge, this ship is anchored. 

00:01:41.305 --> 00:01:45.463
 HMS Middleton, Hunt Class Hunting Specialist min. 

00:01:45.683 --> 00:01:47.328
 It's basically a minesweeper. 

00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:50.854
 Can tell how many mines are in a square matrix ... 

00:01:50.943 --> 00:01:52.091
 Just kidding. 

00:01:52.167 --> 00:01:53.991
 Seeks and destroys mines. 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.785
 And he is able to do so without the mine exploding. 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.029
 Not made of metal. 

00:02:00.351 --> 00:02:03.514
 It is made of fiberglass. 

00:02:03.861 --> 00:02:06.003
 He is able to find and destroy mines, 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.608
 which attract magnetic things, 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.866
 because it is not made of anything magnetic. 

00:02:11.034 --> 00:02:12.769
 It's a plastic ship. 

00:02:12.884 --> 00:02:14.752
 It sounds ridiculous in itself, 

00:02:14.892 --> 00:02:18.246
 but this ship is able to protect better from one particular threat 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.924
 than anything else in the Royal Navy. 

00:02:21.361 --> 00:02:25.378
