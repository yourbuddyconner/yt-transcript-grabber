00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.350
 MATT PARKER: I am very happy to invite to the stage. 

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:07.700
 My friends are also famous "that online guys": 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.180
 Today he wore a Tè£‡ that was not completely red. 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.600
 Please welcome Tom Scott to the stage with applause! 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.600
 TOM SCOTT: Thank you! 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.800
 Remote control? Matt, where are you remotely placed? 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.320
 what! well. Black remote control, black table. Awesome. 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.020
 Hello everyone, my name is Tom Scott! Hello everyone! 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.339
 Great, you are still alive. I accidentally became an expert in emoji. 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:34.649
 I didn't plan - and, sorry, let me declare this first. 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.269
 This speech will be more crude than I am. 

00:00:37.269 --> 00:00:38.709
 There are two reasons for this: 

00:00:38.709 --> 00:00:39.989
 First: I should rehearse well, but I don't have it; 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.400
 And second, I hate shtick, 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:47.129
 I don't like being called "some famous guys." 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.739
 However, there are quite a few shicks in my experience. 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.819
 I was once known as the "pirate guy", and that year was really bad. 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.160
 Now I am also known as the "painting guy". I am not intentional. 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.720
 I did not do it on purpose. However, I had an idea with a friend. 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.010
 We designed a mobile communication software that can only send emoji. 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.930
 Even the username must be emoji. 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.680
 Then we have 70,000 people registered because they scream 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.750
 "What? I want to use my emoji as my username? What should I do?" 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.860
 And it turns out that you can still write swear words in essays with great creativity. 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:18.520
 We thought that we didn't need to filter the swearing. 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.300
 We added filtering. There are many, many short melons. 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.980
 We destroyed the software in just one year. 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.380
 But after I created this, full-size emoji keyboard. 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.079
 The so-called full size is 14 keyboards, with a lot of emoji, all connected together. 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.090
 Because of this, I finally learned 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.540
 Most of the technical details of the emoji. 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.969
 And I became an emoji expert, even 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.380
 The second broadcaster called me and asked me, "Can you bring your keyboard to the past?" 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.040
 I thought to myself: radio. keyboard...? 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.130
 Even for a moment, they asked me like this: 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.940
 "You can... what do you hear when you type?" 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.880
 "Keyboard sounds." 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.200
 So, I went to the radio. So I am an accidental and somewhat dry emoji expert. 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.490
 This is the original emoji. 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.759
 These are the first essays that have appeared in history. 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.119
 I think they are colored here, normal will not, 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.870
 However, an engineer in Japan decided to have - 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.130
 Because of the computer [some reasons] (only ten details in ten minutes) 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.800
 There is still a little space. 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.140
 There is a concept called character encoding, which means 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.410
 Convert the characters we entered into 0 and 1 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:28.319
 So that the computer can understand. 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.810
 Is the United States the first to adopt coding? At least they have created a global version. 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.610
 Not bad, you have A to Z, 0 to 9, not using a lot of vacancies. 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.650
 Japan uses more characters, so it takes a little more space. 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.379
 And because of the computer [some reasons], they still have a little space left. 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.319
 Therefore, an engineer said: "In fact, we can add pictures." 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.560
 In fact, basically, each character is sent a different picture. 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.489
 Just add more. Therefore, the first batch of emoji appeared. 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.620
 Some vehicles, some star symbols, some numbers. 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.090
 These are only used on a single telephone network. 

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:58.530
 Then other telephone networks said, "That is a good idea!" 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.209
 "We want it." But the [coding] system they use is completely different and incompatible. 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.920
 Then the third phone network did the same thing. This is no problem. 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.849
 They are separated and separated. 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.240
 Then, the Unicode Alliance appeared! 

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.680
 Sounds like the bad guys in science fiction, but they are actually 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.870
 a group of linguists and computer scientists responsible for ensuring 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.920
 Everyone can talk to each other online. 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.000
 The reason why people in Japan can send you a short message in Japanese, 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.819
 And the SMS can be delivered to your mobile phone intact, because there is a Unicode Alliance. 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.359
 This is the most amazing of the computer standardization work. 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.320
 They went to France. They look at France, 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.060
 They said, "You are quite like English, no problem. 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.019
 You have a letter that is not too strange, and that's fine. 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.409
 We can take it - thank you, we will put your letters... 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:41.529
 ... put this position in the coding standard. Are you ok? You are done. " 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:43.869
 Ok, they went to Russia and nearby places. they said, 

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:45.629
 "Hey, the letters you use are completely different. 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.309
 Ok, no problem. We will store your letters 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:49.150
 Oh! Sorry, Belarus, you have other letters. 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:50.910
 Ok, we will store all the letters here, 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.450
 Then put it in this position. " 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.650
 Then they went to Japan, and then they said, "Ghosts..." 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.900
 "Okay, Japan, OK, no problem, everything here. 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.180
 Let's put it in this position... OK, no problem, this line, 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.900
 We are going to put them in the standard..." 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:05.400
 "Japan, what are those?" 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.340
 Japan said: "I use emoji, we use these to communicate." 

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.660
 "Those are not letters." 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.640
 "Don't care. We use these to communicate. They are characters." 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.090
 "You have to include them. You know, two-way...?" 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.280
 "What do you think?" 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.910
 "In this way, we have made the United States smile, after all, aren't we?" 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.500
 "Okay, okay, Japan, we have to take care of these, 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.340
 Then put them there, 

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.780
 No one will pay attention. " 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.870
 No one really cares, then Apple is here. 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.990
 Apple wants to sell iPhones in Japan. 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:43.460
 So they put in the emoji keyboard, 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:44.590
 No one has found it in a short time. 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.790
 Then in the UK - sorry, in the United States - one person found: 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.550
 "Hey, I can pass it on to my friends!" 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.950
 Therefore, they passed a message. Their friends asked: "How are you... 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.680
 how did you do it? let me see! " 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:01.470
 Soon, this ready-made "a glimpse" was red with the virus outbreak. 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:04.340
 I think this is a dysentery. 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.140
 Now we have emoji cushions and emoji pillows. 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.800
 This was taken by my friend Dan. He strolled around Dalston. 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:17.130
 I found a emoji pillow and found another store... 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.870
 It turns out that there are many shops in Dalston that sell emoji pillows, if you are interested in buying one. 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:24.860
 This is the motto of the Unicode Alliance: 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:27.500
 It is "to let people around the world use computers in any language." 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.120
 This is how the world understands "painting and writing" - å‘ƒ, unity - 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.870
 "Imagination Alliance"! I thought about it and said it was wrong. 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.350
 This is how the world understands the motto of the Unicode Alliance: 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.420
 Therefore, Unicode 9 was introduced shortly. See how I understand that they announce to the world: 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:47.180
 They said, "Hey! Everyone! Unicode 9 just launched, great!" 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.620
 "There are Osa letters in it!" Osage is 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.400
 New letters designed only a few years ago. This is amazing. 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.440
 "And the Georgia Larry symbol!" The new currency symbol is also included. 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.550
 They just sat at the parliamentary meeting, 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.820
 There is constant debate between representatives of different countries. 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.320
 Arguing how to join a language, 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.820
 Because joining a language is actually complicated. 

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.160
 The world only said "oh". 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:14.740
 "By the way," they said, "We have some new emoji." 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.120
 Suddenly we are tightening! 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:25.640
 Does anyone know what this emoji is? 

00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.780
 By the way, who knows what this emoji is? 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:31.960
 ["You!"] Is it me? Yes, this is very close. Really, shout out... 

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.750
 ["Victory!"] Victory! correct! Who said it first? 

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.630
 Have a tape measure for the lady... 

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:39.370
 Ok, I am afraid... I am afraid this is not necessary, 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.400
 See if we can... oh! 

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.540
 Deviated from one! My movement has always been bad. 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.060
 Yes, this is a "winning expression". Basically no one uses it like this. 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.120
 Because it is designed in Japan, the cultural meaning is different. 

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.760
 This is great, so: 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.170
 The 2016 emoji was released soon. 

00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:00.180
 Below is a part of it. This is from Emojipedia, and there is such a thing in the world. 

00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.200
 As long as they thank them, they can use their emoji again. 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:07.420
 There is one part here, about half of the candidate characters. 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.780
 There is a "disgusting face" here. To be honest, this is late. 

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:13.250
 There is a "duck" here, obviously this is crucial. 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.480
 There is no "duck's face" here, and it should be included. 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.380
 There is a "self-timer" here. 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:20.740
 So you can now put it next to any emoji. 

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.380
 There is also a "dancing man" here, and I will come back to talk about it later. 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.640
 They will probably be approved at a meeting in May 2016. 

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.190
 The end of the year should appear on your phone. 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:29.480
 probably. 

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.460
 Maybe. 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:33.980
 But the interesting â€“ at least for me â€“ is the 2017 emoji. 

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:36.940
 Because we now have the first few candidate characters. 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.720
 We may have a "Chinese food takeout box" and "the eyes are upturned and skeptical" 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.180
 But this is not the most interesting. 

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:44.650
 Because we have these recently, we have skin color modifiers. 

00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:47.250
 Now, these are very important, these are wonderful, 

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:49.520
 Because this means that the emoji is not only the default yellow. 

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:53.110
 Whoever read the "Ason Family" knows that yellow is not a preset neutral. 

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.620
 But: If you want to enter one of them, 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.660
 Behind the scenes, you have entered ordinary emoji. 

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:03.200
 Then enter the so-called "colour modifier" or "character label character". 

00:08:03.200 --> 00:08:08.870
 According to the Patrick color scale from 1 to 5 [distinction]. This is a measure of skin tone. 

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:10.810
 So actually, there are two separate characters first. 

00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:12.740
 Then merge them together. 

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.560
 2017 emoji will have more label characters, if the plan - 

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.710
 As I said, very detailed - 

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:23.490
 If next year, the plan TR52 is passed. 

00:08:23.490 --> 00:08:28.450
 New tag characters will be used to indicate gender... 

00:08:28.450 --> 00:08:30.740
 Gender, hair color, or even direction. 

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.530
 The direction is simple. It allows everyone to agree, when you want to enter "someone shoots at someone," 

00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:37.240
 Where should the muzzle point? 

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.940
 This is easy to use... when... I fired at people. 

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:47.840
 Hair color. It will be black, brown, red, grey, gold and... 

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.160
 Is there anything I have forgotten? Which one did I forget? 

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.540
 ["White!"] No... 

00:08:50.540 --> 00:08:54.220
 Bald! That's it! No hair at all. I know there are at least three people here. 

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:55.440
 The color of the hair is different from the above. 

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.960
 If you disagree with this, 

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.560
 Please find the Unicode Alliance. Don't look for me. 

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:03.840
 I swear that this is the color of the hair taken from the US driver's license. 

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:08.710
 And the effective hair color of the UN pass. 

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:12.210
 I looked at the guidelines, which are the source of the hair color. 

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:14.810
 So, you can choose different skin colors, different hair colors, 

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:18.580
 , as well as gender. Gender is especially important because: 

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:21.500
 On the left is the emoji that Apple uses to represent the "dancer". 

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:25.490
 On the right is the emoji that Android uses to represent "dancers." 

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.830
 So if you are a woman, you say, "I feel like this today:" 

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:33.820
 When I got to the Android user, I saw something went wrong. 

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.710
 So now I have separated the "dancing woman" and the "dancing man." 

00:09:36.710 --> 00:09:40.420
 But for other characters, there is a small person. 

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:42.990
 Plus a gender symbol. This is very good, 

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.050
 Because the current Unicode construction workers are male, 

00:09:45.050 --> 00:09:47.890
 The Unicode receptionist is a woman. 

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:50.360
 Because it was in the 1980s. 

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:54.250
 If you think this is ridiculous, my last argument is that 

00:09:54.250 --> 00:09:56.370
 If you think this is ridiculous, make a fuss, 

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:58.080
 No one cares about these things, 

00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.710
 Just for a single detail, I canâ€™t stand it, 

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:05.300
 Yes, it is true to some extent. Committee meeting 

00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.710
 There will be a lot of things to decide. 

00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.670
 But if you think this is not your business, 

00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:13.640
 Imagine how everyone feels sitting on the committee. 

00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.050
 Because they already have a long list - 

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.300
 I have read the agenda of the recent meeting. I look at it in detail. 

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.890
 It is very exciting inside. 

00:10:18.890 --> 00:10:20.340
 Some of the best linguists, 

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:21.520
 Some of the best computer scientists, 

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.520
 Some of the best computer science linguists 

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:27.260
 The decision to be big in that room, 

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.380
 The language decision and how we use it. 

00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:33.120
 The other side, the 2017 news attention 

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.420
 Is there a condom emoji? 

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:38.540
 I am Tom Scott, thank you and enjoy the rest of the show tonight! 

00:10:44.820 --> 00:10:46.980
 MATT PARKER: Ladies and gentlemen, [just now] Tom Scott! 

00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.620
 If we grow up from Tom Scott, 

00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:59.240
 That is shickk happens. (homophonic) 

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.660
 Also, the plan TR52 is going to vote in favor! 

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.280
 That's all. And, Tom [sure enough] really professional YouTuber 

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:09.520
 On the way he spoke, someone smashed the glass. 

00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.080
 He paused and made a clip gap... 

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.540
 TOM SCOTT: I don't care at all! 

00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:19.800
 MATT PARKER: Then I started from the last sentence part, 

00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.220
 So, please cut this part in your mind! 

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.220
