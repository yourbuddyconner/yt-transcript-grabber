00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.660
 This is a paternoster elevator. There are only a few examples in the world that work, 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.610
 like this one in the Tower of Truth at the University of Sheffield. 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.280
 It is open with a row of connected cabins that circulate 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.669
 and spins in a constant loop 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.339
 One side rises, the other slides down and you just go in and out. This is a twenty- 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:24.960
 why this is a long chain. Paternoster can carry more passengers than 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.779
 ordinary elevator, but obviously there is a greater risk of stroke, injury and injury. 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.950
 This elevator has many additional security features so people do not get hurt. 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.780
 But for that reason, and because they are inaccessible to those who can not walk or carry big 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.430
 objects, or can not walk well, 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.590
 and because there are not many companies in the world that can set up or renew them 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.690
 they do not build. 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.800
 And those who are left are often removed and replaced. No Sheffield 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.090
 has kept theirs, and have several more standard elevators in case they are needed. 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.850
 I can not stay in this elevator while going over the top. Thank you, Chris. 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:00.380
 I would disturb the balance of the whole system and it is possible that firefighters would be extinguished 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.250
 they would have to come for me and take me out. But I can leave this little GoPro camera in order 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.000
 showed you how it looks like going over the top. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.620
 See you for a minute. 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.430
 Here we are. 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.300
 See you! 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:39.900
 I look forward to watching this record. 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.180
