00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.310
 I'm at Arecibo Observatory in Perto Ric. 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.970
 With a diameter of 300 m it is one of the largest radio telescopes in the world. 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.220
 I saw photos and videos before I came here, 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.860
 but honestly, it's impossible to capture the entire telescope on the camera. 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.860
 It's huge. 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.539
 For 50 years listening to the sky, and one day 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.130
 can save the world. 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.140
 Arecibo was part of a broad space exploration. 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.710
 We have discovered pre-biotic molecules in distant galaxies, 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.200
 the first millisecond pulsar and the first exoplanets. 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.660
 The great success that everyone knows, 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.020
 is the Nobel Prize for the discovery of a binary pulsar 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.230
 and its decay - just as the general theory of relativity assumed. 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.110
 We have 50 years of discoveries, 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.050
 so I could talk about them for 50 years. 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.970
 One of the most incredible things in this observatory is 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.610
 this hanging platform I'm just standing on. 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.080
 The entire colossal structure is suspended on ropes, 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.870
 like a suspension bridge - there are no pillars 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.829
 which would hold us in the air and which would ensue. 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.579
 The whole of this weight holds three concrete towers distributed around a plate. 

00:01:05.579 --> 00:01:09.479
 In addition, this platform is not static - much of it is moving. 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.729
 Telescope by moving along a short run north and south, 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.450
 from here it can watch a whole third of the sky. 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.649
 The shape of the plate is spherical. 

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:18.979
 However, 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.649
 that the spherical mirror does not have a focus - like hyperbole - 

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.579
 which we are accustomed to with large optical and most large radio telescopes. 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:28.900
 And so the signal can be focused, 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:32.399
 the so-called Gregorian dome contains two smaller mirrors. 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.829
 These smaller mirrors then focus everything. 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.719
 That means we can have far more precise bandwidths in the Gregorian dome 

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.869
 and we can cover the frequency from 0.3GHz to 10GHz. 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.469
 But Arecibo can do something that most radio telescopes can not do. 

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:51.700
 In 1974, Arecibo sent a famous message to the stars, 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.759
 but there are even more useful uses 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.990
 to transmit powerful energy pulses into space: radar. 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:02.000
 Arecibo can capture radar rays reflected from planets, asteroids 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.799
 and indeed from anything in the nearby solar system 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.700
 And that can be used to create sharp shots of what's up there in the dark. 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.660
 The advantage of using radar imaging is, 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.540
 that you can recognize the shapes far better than the optical image. 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.450
 We can track individual boulders on the surface if they are close enough; 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.130
 we can see if they are bone-shaped or if they look like ... potatoes! 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.970
 S-band transmitter is a high-performance device, 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.070
 which operates at 2380MHz, the so-called S-band. 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.900
 The entire transmitter is powered by one megawatt. 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.630
 This transmitter creates a beam of energy, 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.570
 and if you put your hand under him, you can burn yourself 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.570
 We mostly observe nearby asteroids. 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.820
 When a new asteroid is discovered whose orbit is not yet specified, 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.070
 the main thing we can do is to refine the information about its movement. 

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.810
 When you send a signal that reflects from a moving object, 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.400
 the wavelength of the reflected signal will change, 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.790
 if the asteroid moves toward or away from the observer. 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:10.500
 In this way, we can determine the speed of the asteroid with an accuracy of millimeters per second. 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.930
 When a new asteroid is found, its distance can be determined 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.940
 with accuracy of hundreds or even tens of meters. 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.100
 We can determine exactly where the asteroid will be located 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.560
 in tens or hundreds of years from now. 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.820
 The preliminary orbital information of the Apophis asteroid showed, 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.120
 that he could really hit us. 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:38.700
 But then, when the asteroid was observed with radar, it was found to fly very close, 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:43.690
 possibly interfering with satellites orbiting the earth, 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.310
 but it does not interfere with it. 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.740
 It is very important to know because now 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.290
 we know we do not have to send Bruce Willis to divert the asteroid (!) 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.500
 Of all natural disasters 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.100
 Asteroids are one of the things we can avoid. 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.430
 Earthquakes, volcanoes, these are things that just happen and with which we can not help. 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.260
 But if we notice an asteroid in time, 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.840
 we can divert it. 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.970
 I thank all of the Arecibo Observatory very much. 

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.040
 If you wanted to find out more about these and their discoveries, 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.639
 scroll down for more links 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.910
 and if you want to look behind the scenes of this video, 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.160
 so Matt, who is behind the camera, took a lot of shots, 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.010
 and put them together for the second channel.
