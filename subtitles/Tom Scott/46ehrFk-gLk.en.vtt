 Grammatical sex is the concept, which can be found in a quarter of the world's entire language, 

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:11.000
 that you can sort all nouns in male or female. Leave or laugh in French. There, die or das in German, 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.860
 where das is for neutrals (non-gender). On the sand found in a few countries in central Africa, 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.630
 There are four gender bends: male of man, human of female, living and not living. 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.419
 There are sometimes languages ​​with even more complicated systems. 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:28.050
 Look, I'm a descriptive linguist. I'm not supposed to judge if linguistic properties are 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.480
 good or bad, I'm just meant to describe what they do. But grammatical sex is just one 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.200
 stupid concept. I hate myself a little bit to say it, but it's really silly. Well, that's [[FACT: The Linguistic Mafia will drive you by bus if you break your promise of descriptiveism.]] 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.260
 a computer, or what, French? So it's male. All computers are male. 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.000
 And it's a bottle, French, real? So it's female? All bottles are female? Seriously? 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.600
 Should I dress it up in a cursed pink apron and just as well give it a rolling pin? 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.539
 "Sigh" (Descriptiveism, Tom. Don't judge.) 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.350
 I am exaggerating, but I have really tried to search the literature for some benefits 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.250
 by grammatical sex. There is only a slight convincing argument, which is that it can 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.240
 help clarify ambiguities and speed up recognition of words a little. Okay. But three quarters 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.600
 of the world's languages ​​do just fine without it. 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.640
 Meanwhile, grammatical sex causes damn many problems. 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.840
 First problem: it affects the way you think. When asked to describe a key, it was German speaking 

00:01:24.841 --> 00:01:30.080
 - who classifies "key" as male - most obviously to associate it with "hard," "heavy" and 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.049
 "thanks," whereas Spanish speakers - who classify "key" as female - were more inclined to 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.270
 to say it was "golden," "intricate" and "small". It also says a lot about gender roles in 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.909
 society, but frankly, it's something I'm not qualified to talk about. 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.390
 Second problem: it's really awkward. Job ads in language with grammatical gender is 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.189
 need to use both terms or a peer marker to clarify that they are leading for any one. 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.060
 Which brings me to English. English does not have grammatical sex - it once did 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.359
 in Old English. We still have a few words such as "blonde" and "blonde" that change meaning 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.300
 by sex, but we do not have to worry about having to fit everything into a box or the other. 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:13.800
 However, we have the third person pronounced "he", "she" and "it". And that's a problem. 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.590
 If I want to refer to you, the viewer, then I must use the placeholder "he or she". Which is ridiculous 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.599
 For several reasons: one is an unmanageable three syllables, and that sounds awful. Thaw, 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.099
 There are people who do not fit in, or will declare, neither of those categories 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.510
 And if it surprises you, then you need to get more out. Since "it" is a bit dehumanizing, [[Source: the outside world]] 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.909
 is there really no suitable place to use. 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:40.030
 Except. English has a solution. And many people use it. And many 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.190
 old-fashioned people hate it. The answer is "they". 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.290
 Facebook uses "de". I signed up for Facebook before they started asking for sex, and 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.879
 I have never actually told them I am a guy. So my friends will see "Tom Scott updated" 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.980
 his (their) profile picture ". And you know what? It sounds perfectly good to me. It works 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.629
 just normal now. It will depend on your dialect if it sounds good to you, 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:05.530
 But be aware, because entals "they"? It spreads fast. I bet you didn't even notice 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.780
 then you used in the very first sentence of this video. [[It's not true. I cut that line and forgot about this line. Oops.]] 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.230
 And it has history. Even Shakespeare used it. 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.470
 Even better, because "they" sound natural, handle that problem of trying to force 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.049
 invented pronouns in English - which, let's be honest, never actually worked. 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.290
 So there you have it. I have opposed my descriptor training and have said that a linguistic trait 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.220
 is better than another. 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:35.500
 And you know what? I'm fine with that. Because ... some people are "they". Get over it. (who apologized to Stonewall)
