00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.550
 In the next six films, 

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:02.750
 There will be a player, 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:04.210
 game designer, 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:05.280
 Mathematician, 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.400
 And one magician 

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.500
 They will kill in a series of skillful and rational games. 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.090
 In the end, there is only one winner. 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.420
 Welcome to the war 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.499
 The commentary is my Tom Scott and 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:19.470
 Game designer David Bodycombe 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:19.970
 Hello everyone! 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.099
 Today we are going to play "guess attack and defense" 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:25.149
 Play by player Emma Blackery 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:26.680
 Magician Steven Bridges 

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.100
 Why am I nervous? This is just a guessing fist! 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.110
 The first step is to guess the fist, if you win 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.570
 You can hit your opponent's head with a dice 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.520
 Of course, before he picked up the helmet defense 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.090
 We played a total of seven, and the first seven people won this game. 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.750
 In theory, we all think that the stone will win. 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.550
 So if you think so, you should have to lay out 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.920
 Steven: Damn! Emma: Cool! 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:55.500
 Steven: 噢Emma: The power of video! All right 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.260
 Can we look at the replay? Because that's really... 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.440
 This also shows that height is not necessarily dominant in this game. 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.670
 Oh my God, it took me a long time to react. I actually came out with stones. 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.509
 I really like the action I just picked up the scorpion, like this... 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:11.350
 I am worried that I will grab the helmet and give her a go. 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.069
 I think this is very likely to happen. 

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.140
 Steven: I am really disappointed with myself. 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.479
 I really feel that it was a very good opening. 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:17.049
 That is what you won. 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:17.950
 I started to be a little scared. 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.850
 Ready? 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.160
 YES! And it will call yeah! Transfer 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.280
 Emma: This is harder! Steven: Not easy! 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.240
 When you were about to knock on me, I was still thinking about it. 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.860
 Is it necessary to pick up the helmet to defend? 

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:35.079
 It is worth mentioning that it is very important to take the props. 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.539
 If you take the wrong item, you will lose one point. 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.480
 Do not! 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.460
 You are becoming more and more skilled 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.020
 And we also deliberately make the helmet design more difficult to take 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.219
 Otherwise, we will spend a whole day here! 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.679
 That's right, but we have tried it, defense has a chance to succeed. 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:52.999
 God, I seem to be a little too serious. I think...well, continue 

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:55.329
 You are fully in the state! I am doomed. He has entered the state! 

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.659
 No, it’s not like this. For me, you grabbed the first incense, then... 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:00.959
 I am trying to pull back the disadvantage 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.160
 You are ahead! You are already ahead 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.820
 Oh alright 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.920
 The helmet can't be won at all! 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.580
 This is too difficult to take! 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.920
 Guessing boxing determines everything 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.540
 This is too much! 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.380
 You only have to guess the fists are more powerful. 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.640
 One minute on the stage, ten years of work 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.650
 I have already encountered it. 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.160
 So, do you want to be closer? 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.510
 no! Speaking like I will lose the same 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.080
 As I mentioned before, Steven already has it in his head. 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.300
 His own set of guessing theory system 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.600
 He is a magician, he observes humans... 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.160
 He understands people's minds and will also become magic 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.020
 He should be the one who knows the human mind best. 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.180
 Emma: Ah! Steven: You reach over and stop again! 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.600
 I am confused by you! 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.980
 I was wondering if it was a stone? Wait a minute! Then I was knocked 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.090
 The most exciting thing about this game is to doubt whether it is an attacker or a defender. 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.960
 When you find that you have the wrong props, you will hold on 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:56.460
 Then you lose your points. 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.790
 That's right! Just like that, that's it. 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.970
 He hasn't brought it yet, beat him! 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.209
 No, that’s not a problem. 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:04.931
 Steven: It's too classic Emma: I am joking. 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.480
 Because we reached out at the same time, we stopped 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.430
 Fortunately, I will pick it up quickly. 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.290
 I just want to say that I am out of the stone, you are out of the scissors. 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.560
 Emma: It should be that I knocked you right! Steven: Oh, my God. 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.350
 "Knocking" is actually the official language. 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.830
 That's right, but it’s all gone. 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.740
 Hey, I should have to pinch a few more, it’s super-feeling, that’s a sense of satisfaction. 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:22.850
 Don't say as if you will win the same 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:23.500
 I just won. 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.700
 I feel that my head seems to have no way to deal with this situation, then... 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.680
 That’s really terrible, you’re just guessing and guessing, you’ve lost. 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.480
 It’s just a game of luck. 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.170
 You just lost more than I have. 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.280
 Guessing a fist is not a game of luck. 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.420
 Tom: Especially when your opponent is a magician, David: That's right. 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.390
 You still have the opportunity to recover, you have to win seven to win. 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.580
 Even if you are six points behind, there is still a chance to reverse the victory. 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.090
 Emma: Yes, Steven: The famous saying. 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.850
 Encourage, I need encouragement. Ready? 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.140
 Ah, almost. Can we look at it... (replay)? 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.440
 No problem, wait for this, yes. 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.920
 I use a helmet to knock myself! 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.030
 I just told you that the problem will be the helmet. 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.410
 That is also possible to be born on me at any time. 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.840
 Ah, we came to the deciding game. 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.540
 Steven: Really? Emma: Yes, you are 6 to 1 to me. 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.680
 Tension, excitement, come on 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.220
 Ah, she took the wrong props! 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.660
 She took the wrong props! 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.870
 Emma: The old lady is not playing (turning the table Steven: Oh, my God. 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.960
 Actually! I actually lost my habit! 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.790
 Steven will go straight to the next round. 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.910
 Emma is not yet eliminated. 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:20.100
 Yes, she still has the chance to win, but she must... 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.380
 If she wants to win, then she will win every game. 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.810
 The next game is Hannah vs. Katie. What games do they want to play? 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.220
 Is a game about "Digital, Dexterity, Dice" 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:34.020
 Are you very angry that I told you to read that line? (Because Dexterity is not good) 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.740
 Nonsense, that’s still used 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.700
