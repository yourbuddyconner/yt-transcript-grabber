00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.629
 Behind me is the last surviving toll road from London 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.580
 on a private road through Dulwich College 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.230
 At the beginning of the nineteenth euw 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.949
 Almost all roads in London were toll roads 

00:00:11.949 --> 00:00:17.610
 And not just London, there were hundreds of toll roads across the country 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.650
 Companies had a government-approved monopoly on specific pieces of road. 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.100
 They kept the road in a reasonable state, 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.510
 at least in the standard of that time 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.390
 and in exchange they could ask for a toll. 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:31.990
 But traveling through the country meant a toll 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.170
 dozens of maybe corrupt companies had to pay in your trip. 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.289
 Even by going to London you would encounter your toll road after toll road after toll road. 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:44.979
 The Turnpike Trusts did some good: with the money they paid a reasonable road network. 

00:00:44.979 --> 00:00:48.120
 But they were not loved: before the toll roads came the roads, 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.089
 although they were often bumpy and difficult to travel on, free of charge. 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.039
 So there were complaints, and occasional strikes, but the toll roads remained. 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.149
 But then the railways came. 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.829
 Suddenly everyone could pay toll roads 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.129
 also pay a faster and more comfortable option. 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.940
 So both man and freight moved to the track 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.820
 The Turnpike Trusts fell apart, 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.420
 municipalities took over all roads, 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.360
 and by the time there were highways, 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.250
 it was already recognized that tax was collected by the government 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.460
 who used that tax money to build new roads. 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.940
 But what if history had been slightly different? 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.680
 Where would we be if all roads were still private, 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.460
 if every major route had a toll that did not go to the government, 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.610
 such as the Congestion Charge or contemporary American toll roads, 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.810
 but to the private institution that manages it? 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.630
 As every time you drove on the Westway of London, 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.850
 you had to pay Â£ 5 to Westway Corporation, sponsored by McDonalds? 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.000
 Well, actually, uh, we are in France. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.310
 Most French car routes, the highways here, 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.850
 are in the possession of private institutions, which collect tolls as before. 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.060
 You do not have to go to some bizarre alternative reality full of zeppelins to find toll gates - 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.090
 there are always zeppelins in alternative realities - 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.040
 all you have to do is cross the Channel. [Translation: Spider3]
