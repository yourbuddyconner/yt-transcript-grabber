00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.330
 This is a bag and a bottle of freeze-dried urine, 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:07.620
 and the US government sells it for $ 983 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.450
 and shipping costs. 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.040
 That might be the strangest sentence I ever started a video with, 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:13.040
 but it is true. 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.910
 What is even more weird: that is a pretty reasonable price. 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.560
 These are two of the more than 1,000 standard reference materials 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.510
 which are stored here at the National Institute for Standards and Technology. 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.720
 Here at NIST, we make Standard Reference Materials 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.680
 or short-term SRMs. 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.300
 SRMs are super-characterized materials that our customers use 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.870
 to be sure that the measurements of their materials and processes 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.780
 accurate and reliable. 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.750
 If a customer buys one of our SRMs, 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.530
 they get a unit of the material and an analysis certificate. 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.170
 Each property, whether it is the chemical composition 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.489
 whether the physical characteristics of the material are, 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:50.830
 is a certified property 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.059
 and is measured extremely carefully. 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:57.489
 The analysis certificate is just as important as the material itself. 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.260
 Without the certificate and all information contained therein, 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.820
 is the SRM just a bottle of stuff. 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.539
 We have a variety of nutrients in our SRM catalog, 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:09.030
 such as this pureed spinach. 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.889
 If you puree the spinach, it is nice and homogeneous. 

00:01:11.889 --> 00:01:15.899
 A little above, is exactly the same as a bit of soil. 

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.259
 We also have our infamous household crap, 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.939
 from a wastewater treatment plant, 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:28.289
 that is dreamed and grinded to this beautiful fine powder. 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:29.289
 We take this material; 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.579
 we set out which poisonous elements are in it; 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.700
 that is what it is used for. 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.630
 We also have microscope slides with space pellets between them. 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.079
 They are polystyrene granules of 10 micrometres, 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.099
 that have been formed in weightlessness on the Space Shuttle. 

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:52.100
 Some sensitive materials must be stored under cryogenic conditions. 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.409
 We have peanut butter, in a glass jar. 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.209
 Oh, it's cracking. 

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:03.600
 Then we have whale bacon, organic material in whale bacon. 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.530
 This is whale bacon from a stranded whale. 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.150
 It is used to measure biological pollution in the environment 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.709
 and whales are at the top of the food chain. 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.430
 Each of these reference materials must be exactly the same, 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.170
 far behind the comma. 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.100
 They are used worldwide to calibrate and test equipment. 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.360
 Now, there are also other locations where reference materials are made. 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.780
 The difference is that everything in this warehouse has a stamp of approval from the American government. 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:37.700
 For the sake of clarity: by far the most reference materials here are pretty boring. 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.180
 They are intended for industrial processes, so they are made of metal, glass or pure chemical elements. 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.180
 There are three types of bauxite: from Suriname, Jamaica or the Dominican Republic. 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.329
 There are even very precise gas mangles available, 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.090
 just like a number of radioactive substances. 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.799
 Sometimes it takes years before we have obtained a new material, 

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.200
 what will become an SRM for a number of years. 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.560
 We buy industrial material directly. 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.970
 It comes every time we make it from somewhere else, 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.459
 but we always make it in the same way, 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:07.709
 and we characterize it in the same way. 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.200
 Whether we determine the chemical composition or the physical properties, 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.150
 we do it with great precision. 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.069
 There are also SRMs that are used to determine how they break. 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:21.219
 We measure again and again, in different ways, 

00:03:21.219 --> 00:03:25.790
 to be sure that what we measure is the true value in that particular material. 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.849
 The material itself is not exact. 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:29.989
 The measurements that characterize it are exact. 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.810
 If you had not figured it out yet, 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.030
 the reason that there is freeze-dried urine as reference material, 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.159
 is because there are people with machines that test urine. 

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:40.930
 They are investigating the presence of drugs, 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.129
 so the Institute sells your urine with exact quantities 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.269
 metabolic products of cannabis or cocaine, 

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:50.409
 or they examine it for toxins and toxic elements. 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:52.769
 So if you have to calibrate such a machine, 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.969
 to make sure that the result is correct, 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.100
 then the people here are the people you have to have. 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:01.389
 Thanks to everyone here at the National Institute for Standards and Technology. 

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.840

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.020
