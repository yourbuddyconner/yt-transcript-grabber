00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.300
 I'm in the English countryside near Canterbury, 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.380
 and this is a railroad crossing. 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.540
 Nothing extraordinary, except that, 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.280
 that this crossing is controlled by pedestrians. 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.480
 And these are relatively few and far apart. 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.300
 This little red and green light tells you when it's safe to pass. 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.920
 When it's safe, you have to climb out of the car, 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.100
 which you came here, 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:26.260
 and self-propelled lifting barriers. 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.200
 I'm aware of how this movement looks like (͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.280
 And this is not unusual in itself, 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.780
 crossings like this are in different regions of England, 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.660
 in the valleys of Wales, on smaller lines, but what 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:41.940
 maybe you do not know that this is not a provincial rail route. 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:48.500
 It is a high-speed railroad that runs the Javelin trains from London to Ramsgate. 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.400
 Those driving at 225 km / h. 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.880
 And, yeah, right here does not go 255, 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.420
 driving at 64 km / h, maximum 80 km / h, 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.780
 but everything that prevents me from blocking this route, 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.520
 or even worse, to be hit by a train, is - well, - this crossing, 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.720
 and this little lever down here that launches 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.460
 barriers and allows safe passage for trains. 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.260
 This is a user- 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.320
 which is something you may not have known. 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.240
