00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:05.080
 The Avenue of the Americas! One of the most important streets in New York. 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.820
 There is the famous Radio City Music Hall. 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.820
 And there are two gas bottles with liquid nitrogen, they are simply unattended on the street side. 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:14.840
 Yes, that sounds a bit strange ... 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.680
 Enough people walk by and think: "Do you hear that standing there?" 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.600
 More people walk by and do not even see them. 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.600
 I thought it was strange, so I decided to find it out. 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.040
 It appears that they are owned by telephone companies. 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.580
 Look, in New York there is a lot of steam and water underground, 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.300
 from municipal heating systems, water pipes, that sort of thing. 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.120
 Telephone cables can therefore become very wet and, well, fall apart. 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.460
 Every three days someone from the telephone company comes by, 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.840
 he replaces these empty gas bottles with full ones. 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.900
 The nitrogen is continuously pumped through the tunnels with telephone cables ... 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.700
 ... so they stay dry and away from oxygen and moisture. 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:59.240
 The cold is only a side-effect of how to store these amounts of nitrogen. 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.860
 It also seems unsafe, is not it? 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.560
 But, I picked it out and apparently there have never been any accidents with it, 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.820
 and if one of the many, many vehicles on this busy street collide with these gas bottles, 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.640
 then it is said to remain empty only. 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.000
 It seems strange, but there are many things in every city that seem strange, 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.360
 and liquid nitrogen is one of the least weird things. 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.360
 Welcome to New York. 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.780
