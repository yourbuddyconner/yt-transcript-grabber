 Welcome to a city that does not exist. Well, according to the story. This is Bielefeld, 

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:10.150
 in the northwest of Germany. And since the viral Internet joke of 1994 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.120
 - Although the term "viral" did not exist at that time - but since then 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.730
 there is a gag (joke) in Germany about Bielefeld's conspiracy that it's a fancy city. 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.900
 The questions are "Do you know someone from there?" "Have you ever been there?". 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.670
 Most people say no. So how can you be sure it exists and that it's not something they "want" you to think? 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.010
 Faith is an incredibly powerful thing. Bielefeld conspiracy is a joke that everyone understands, 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.789
 but it's a joke that safely shows how good our brain is in questioning. 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.809
 I guarantee that you can challenge any form of evidence 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.949
 only after a few seconds of thinking. Maps? Falsely. Photos? Falsely. Video recording? Either shot 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:56.140
 somewhere else, or it's just a confidential computer graphics. Did you visit him yourself? 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.370
 Bad memories, thoughtful lies, I'm sure you can come up with something better. 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.510
 Every group of people, regardless of size, has its own references, own jokes, 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.410
 their characters that define them. From jokes that you and your friends only understand, 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.190
 or your partner, to millions of rickling people. 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:18.500
 Or the whole of Germany that has Bielefeld, which is the concept and pronunciation, 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.690
 which I'm a bit spoiled because I'm not a German. 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.540
 But the groups connected by faith are strong. Whether it is religion or atheism, 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.210
 politics, whether they are parties or views of society, or belief in conspiracy theory - we humans 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.260
 we connect with people who think we are ourselves. And then we expand our ideas slowly 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.570
 and unconsciously transform our minds to be like those around us and to prefer people like us. 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.040
 Soc. psychologist Henri Tajfel conducted experiments in the 1970s and 1980s with something he called 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.590
 "paradigm of minimal groups": What is the smallest stimulus for the attitude we have against them? 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.640
 His answer was that basically everything. 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.320
 So, it's probably best to get out of the "echo chamber" every once in a while 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.360
 we find ourselves, trying to look at the world from the point of view of different people, and think, 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.569
 if we happen to be a little mistaken. Eventually, I can also be part of a conspiracy. 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.600
