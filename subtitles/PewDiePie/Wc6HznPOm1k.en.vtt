 I thought it was real .. for your revenues estimated at 0 Oh because it is true that it is real, young people. Thank you .. Thank you 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.040
 It is certainly wonderful to entertain millions of people. That's true 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.320
 I enjoy with my original content and I get a lot of support 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.020

 Arza, yaar ... I remember 19 participants and I was very happy. I was very happy. What a wonderful moment 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.500
 I was wondering how much of the contributions on PewDiePie Trevelo .. They have gone away, young guys lying 

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.900
 Thank you so much. That's why we do not have nice things. Hey, Ante Stazugin man "show Mim" that? 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.280
 I'm not English, I'm Italian. Sorry I completely forgot 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.500
 Lemar Yes 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.299
 You are married to a man who has a "Mim Show". It is really useful when I feel hungry 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:28.580
 I just do this and start she immediately cooked pasta. This is not a joke. This is just the fact that they make wonderful macaroni 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.340
 I do not know what to say to you, man, what do you think about marriage? 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.700

 Hey guys now what YouTube is doing is that everything is green 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:50.180
 Everything I download is green, but then I check the revenue and it is like .. congratulations .. this video has ads 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:52.980
 I've earned $ 2 on these millions of views 

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:58.560
 thank you. I am happy because it is for the benefits instead of the yellow color. This is a very big difference for me 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:02.200
 I can look at the camera like anyone else but will I? 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.520
 I said it was a self-timer. I said, this is the shocking rock band 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:14.020

 Well, but will I? 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.060
 Keep up the work of Mimz ... and see where things will go 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:33.940
 This joke is not real .. well 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:35.600
 Or ... did not I do this? 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:43.100

00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.880

 Check out the link in the description and get the final glory to put in your achievements. Mimi appeared in "The Mimiz Show" 

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.440
 I mean "Loay" whatever the very same thing is basically hard to swallow pills ... and Budibay does not kill the Mimiz 

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:49.260
 We just stop publishing them because we know he will not review them anymore and we are desperate for his lack of interest 

00:08:49.260 --> 00:08:50.600
 I do not know if you agree with this 

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:55.800
 I think it's like just explaining the joke to many people that they lose value 

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:58.040
 Unless there are more ways to say it again 

00:08:58.040 --> 00:09:02.320
 I think if anything if M did not succeed in the "Mimiz Review" 

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:08.020
 It's a testimonial that it's likely that it was not such a quality to be M-Never done. This is the truth, Bob and ya guys 

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:13.300
 I've left three in a row for now. Click twice for this success if you want more 

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.200
 * Do not wear headphones * Well, you think you are very intelligent? Huh? Do you think you are very intelligent? Okay 

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.320
 Damn 

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:29.800
 Well, I've signed up once .. Once out what .. 120 Loop! 

00:09:29.800 --> 00:09:36.660
 Fifty episodes once you hit me, whatever. I do not care. 9 left me, okay 

00:09:36.660 --> 00:09:42.560
 I still have 9 .. I can not believe that Boods lost Sweden by mistake .. Come on Sweden 

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:45.960
 This is actually good, as you know 

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.680
 When I do Twitter, I can not wait to be surrounded by people crying here in England as soon as Sweden loses 

00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:58.280
 Everyone was like they did not play well .. They did not play a serious .. This without nothing 

00:09:58.300 --> 00:10:01.040
 This mim only works if you give it some time 

00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:01.680
 Okay 

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.960
 It's supposed to take a mem from the past and then something happens 

00:10:05.029 --> 00:10:10.359
 In the future and then you can say did not play well. You can not in 20 minutes to sample 

00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:12.300
 you say 

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:17.000
 They did not play well, it is not funny everyone has twittered me and I say you are not funny 

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.300
 Well, you're stupid and yeah, it sounds like a good game 

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:27.700
 Because England lost and I hoped they would win because I wanted them to lose in the finals 

00:10:27.700 --> 00:10:29.220
 I want people to suffer 

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:35.829
 What is it, man? Okay. This is the upper Mim. What is it, man? You're trying to make a ground sandwich, my brother 

00:10:35.829 --> 00:10:36.800
 I do not know what you're trying to say 

00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:41.220
 I am in America and you are in India if we put a piece of bread on the ground at the same time ... 

00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:47.300
 I think I do not understand the game and now. I understand. I am ready, my brother. And I am also. Great 

00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:51.160
 This was all for this week of "Loay" I loved this much 

00:10:51.160 --> 00:10:52.700
 👏👏👏👏 

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:55.960
 This makes me really happy, thank you guys on all the mimes 

00:10:55.960 --> 00:11:01.740
 I really appreciate it and thank you for watching my districts every day. see you tomorrow
