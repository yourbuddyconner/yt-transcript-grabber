00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.880
 I think this dome standing on a windy field in Denmark, 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.210
 is the most frustrating artwork in the world. 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.820
 I know it sounds like a bold statement, I'll explain. 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.309
 This is Elia, designed by artist Ingvar Cronhammare. 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:17.019
 He is known for his dark, industrial art, which looks like a machine. 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:19.480
 Or as something of an enemy, something strange. 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.880
 Elia definitely belongs to this category. 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.679
 It is here, near the Danish town of Herning, since 2001. 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.519
 It measures 32 meters if you count the chimneys. 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.980
 The stairs leading up to the prospect are uncomfortably large 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.630
 as if they were not intended for people. 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.430
 A comparison of the spacecraft that landed in the middle of the Danish countryside sounds like a clichÃ© .... 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.770
 ... however, when you stand here, it is quite sitting. 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.050
 Something strange about her. 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.980
 Which is all admirable, but that's not frustrating. 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.740
 In the middle, between the pillars, there is a gas burner 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.750
 and he treads huge flames eight meters high. Huge explosion. 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.660
 And that is one of the menacing and disturbing things on this sculpture: 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.489
 they can blow out the flames at any moment. 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.880
 Though they probably will not go out. 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.189
 Because it happens on average once 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.079
 in two to three weeks for 25 seconds. 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:16.200
 At random, the computer decides. 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.789
 It may take months to the next blast 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:19.750
 or just a few days. 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.090
 And according to an article in local newspapers 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.310
 it does not start if the wind is too strong, which is probably today 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.850
 or if they are too close to people. 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.920
 Website Elii will not tell you when another blast comes 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.219
 just archive the dates and times of those you've come across. 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.770
 Keeping the archive probably to be ridiculed, I do not know exactly. 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.069
 Of course, there are a few photos and videos from lucky people. 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:43.069
 You can look at the internet. 

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.709
 But you can also look at Mona Lisa 

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:48.420
 in much greater resolution than you would have seen with your eye, incredibly detailed. 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.469
 But that does not prevent people from pushing to the Louvre in Paris and fighting with the self-sticks. 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.140
 That's something personal about. 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.139
 So, if Elia gets you, if you want to see that fire with your own eyes, 

00:01:59.139 --> 00:02:01.569
 you will have to camp and watch it here 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:04.250
 24 hours a day, maybe several months. 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.399
 For me, I have about an hour of time, 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:09.300
 before I have to leave to catch the plane. 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.700
 So I hope.
