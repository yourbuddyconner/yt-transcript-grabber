00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.040
 In 1963, an anthropologist named Edward T. Hall, realized 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.450
 that there was no name for the examination of personal space, 

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.200
 so he invented one. 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.770
 Because that's what anthropologists do. 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.260
 He called it 'proxemics', and it struck 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.360
 because it turned out to be a good way to make people think about abstract issues 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.360
 as: 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.380
 how do you react when someone comes too close too quickly? 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.790
 What we have here is a 'robot-spinning dress'. 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.710
 It is a dress with mechanical arms that react. 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.820
 He responds when you come closer. 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.010
 There are two proximity sensors here. 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.150
 They are hidden in the balls that belong to the design. 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.740
 They observe whether you come too close. 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.510
 There are 12 pre-programmed situations. 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.660
 And in fact he chooses one of these 12 situations 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.800
 to make one of these animations. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.489
 Hall presents four distance zones in his book: 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.551
 The public, the social, the personal and the intimate zone. 

00:00:59.551 --> 00:01:04.820
 In the kind of life workshops where people are sent, 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.510
 and in books for mediors, 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.979
 these zones are considered a fact, 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.930
 as 'this is how everyone behaves'. 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.500
 But in Hall's own words: the zones were only a first estimate. 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.490
 They were based on a small selection of highly educated Americans. 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.230
 They were not representative of human behavior in general, 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.290
 and were not meant to be that way either. 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.350
 It was true rough stereotypes. 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.930
 Actually, a large part of the book is rough stereotypes. 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.450
 There is a whole section entitled 'The French', 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.790
 that she describes as "sensually involved with each other." 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.040
 I used 3D models to make this design. 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.890
 I use a program called 'Maya', and then 3D-print it out. 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.960
 It is made of nylon, with a technique called 'selective laser sintering.' 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.390
 You see many difficult forms here that are very thin in certain places, 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.650
 and they are very weak. 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.640
 The technique of selective laser sintering means that 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.229
 you have a big box of powder, in this case, nylon; 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.420
 and you have your laser beam. 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.420
 He sintering it out, 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.790
 and he makes the model exactly as you made it. 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.910
 Actually, when you get this design out, 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:09.709
 you get it out of a big box full of powder, 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:11.359
 and all the powder falls off. 

00:02:11.359 --> 00:02:13.489
 The proximity sensors are in this dress, 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:14.819
 so on the front of the dress, 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:19.299
 and they observe a beam that is sent to the microcontroller 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:20.650
 which is in the back piece. 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.579
 As a scientific theory, the field of proxemics is very vague. 

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:27.450
 Hall thought it over once and called it in his book. 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.010
 There are not so many studies with a lot of strict research and statistics. 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.549
 It is primarily a series of observations and ideas. 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:39.029
 But despite what some hyper-rationalist people think, they are also of value. 

00:02:39.029 --> 00:02:41.170
 Being aware of the hidden rules that lead us, 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.419
 ask why we do as we do, 

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:47.939
 can be a good way to find out how the world works. 

00:02:47.939 --> 00:02:50.319
 And visualizing something that is not only invisible, 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:52.329
 but actually an abstract concept? 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:56.140
 That can be a good way to understand yourself. 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.760
 With thanks to Anouk Wipprecht, 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.760
 her dress is on show 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.080
 at the Autodesk Gallery in San Francisco until March 2017. 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.299
 See the description for more links 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.139
 about her, the dress and the gallery.
