00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.280
 I am in Cape May, at the southern tip of New Jersey, where the US military corps of engineers 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.500
 just finished rebuilding the beach. 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.249
 There is a scraper foot in the ocean, and it's like a vacuum cleaner 

00:00:11.249 --> 00:00:14.339
 and it absorbs a mixture of sand and water into it. 

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:15.950
 Then it moves back towards the coast 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.980
 And the sand and water mixes up on the beach 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.770
 And then bulldozers and construction equipment will shape the beach 

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.849
 and build the shape designed to reduce the damage caused by stormy weather. 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.779
 We use several self-emptying scrapers and mile-long tubes 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.460
 we use construction equipment, bulldozers and excavators 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.030
 to do the work. 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.530
 We demobilize from here, 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:38.460
 so all this equipment is going to another section of Cape May, 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.879
 And then we will start bottom crabs and sand filling operations there. 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.100
 Miami Beach in the US, Gold Coast in Australia, the beaches of Dubai: 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.820
 Around the world, engineers pump sand from the sea back onto the beaches. 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.329
 Not because the tourists want it, 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.940
 But more importantly, these beaches protect people living next door 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.969
 the ocean. 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.000
 And as the ocean surface rises, erosion of the beach begins to occur faster and faster. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.600
 In New Jersey there are many buildings in danger during stormy weather. 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.040
 Walkways, utilities, roads, homes and businesses. 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.210
 And this process is the best tool we have to reduce damage costs in stormy weather 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.020
 in an efficient and environmentally acceptable way. 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.980
 But there is another thing you can use sand for: 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.880
 Any concrete building in the world, any skyscraper, 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.140
 is basically just a lot of sand, like this one, glued together with cement. 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.711
 And the world slowly runs out of it. 

00:01:30.711 --> 00:01:35.070
 I know it sounds strange, but the building industry spends many billions of tons of sand each 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.070
 year. 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.150
 So the obvious solution would be: Use sand somewhere else, right? 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.610
 We have whole deserts and seabeds full of sand. 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.869
 But that type of sand is not usable. 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:49.890
 Desert sand and sea sand are too fine and smooth, and it does not stick properly together, 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.380
 neither good enough to use in concrete nor to rebuild a beach like this. 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.340
 It must be this kind of sand: 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.649
 Sand that has been lent to water that moves and waves infinitely. 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.540
 It is not an infinite resource, not in human time. 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.510
 And if it's not there to protect the coast: 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:09.680
 Then the people living nearby must be concerned. 

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.630
 This project was first implemented in 1990 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.750
 and we have returned several times over the years 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.750
 to re-supply and pump extra sand onto the beach. 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.190
 If we did not pump sand up in this area and thus built a system 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.160
 communities would be more at risk of injury 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.420
 from hurricanes, nor'easters, and other stormy weather. 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.140
 That we run out of sand does not mean that we will suddenly be unable to build 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.140
 Any. 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.010
 It just means that when the volume falls, say, the price of construction of buildings will increase ... 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.620
 And there will be some brutal market forces. 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.940
 No one is considering emptying New Jersey's coast for sand in the near future 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.040
 But journalist Vince Beiser spent years researching 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.760
 illegal sand mining in developing countries, and he returned with reporting on 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.440
 missing islands, destroyed ecosystems and murderous black-market sand mafias. 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.630
 Hundreds of people have been killed because of sand. 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.100
 now and then the engineering corps helps a community in security, 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.890
 some birds in safety and make sure there is still a beach for the tourists this summer. 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.040
 But in a hundred years, who knows? 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.220
 Maybe New Jersey will be offered a better price for this sand.
