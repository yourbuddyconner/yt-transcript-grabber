00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.180
 Good morning ladies, you are watching PEW News now. 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.140
 PEWPEWPEWPEWPEWPEWPEWP (゚∀.) 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.400
 *Opening music* 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.100
 Good evening, I am the anchor Gloria Borger, you are watching PEW News. 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.300
 Youtube is the most trustworthy.. news channel 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.600
 Speaking of Youtube 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.060
 Our first report from Youtube on Youtube complained: 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.640
 "Why are the videos I subscribe to not sorted in chronological order? 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.820
 The Youtube team responded: "Clarify, we are currently trying some new sorting methods" 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.000
 Since I am Gloria Borger, I should give my most objective opinion. 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.240
 but... 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.020
 *painful call* 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.500
 This sounds like a bad idea (laugh) 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.100
 God, in the past few years, Youtube has done a lot of changes that no one likes or wants. 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.920
 But they always go their own way, but they never cause too much trouble. 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.580
 But our subscription video is our last main castle, the last defense, 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.920
 At least not changed or updated to 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.300
 No one will use the classification. Like... 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.960
 Recommended videos, home videos, popular videos 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.960
 These are the classifications that no one knows, but he is there. 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.220
 In a sense, they are quite convenient, but they are millions of "do not move" subscription videos. 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.060
 Although they also mentioned that this is just a test 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.680
 But old and private.. honestly 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.020
 They basically put him on 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.600
 *laugh* 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.940
 Youtube mentioned: This is just a small test 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.360
 Can be set by yourself 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.160
 Ethan Klein mentioned on Twitter: It is a very dangerous move for you to do so. 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.280
 This will make Youtube die. 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.260
 It’s about the same as Facebook today. If I say that I didn’t notice it, it’s a lie. 

00:01:54.269 --> 00:01:58.000
 But I want - I have to tell the truth because I am Gloria Borger 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.600
 Every time there is an update, someone will not like it, but those are often not so bad. 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.300
 I haven't seen it yet, so I can't comment: 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.180
 "This is really bad, it will ruin Youtube" 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.780
 Because I am super objective and perfect ゚∀゚(゚∀゚)ノ

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.020
 PEWPEWPEWPEWPEWPEW 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.860
 Remember VICE? Nothing wrong, claiming to be: 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.100
 "The coolest magazine in history," said the chief editor of VICE: 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.780
 "We know what the new generation is thinking" 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.420
 "We know what the new generation wants" 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.480
 That's why their article has "Rick and Moti's incest film" and 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.200
 "Please don't open the joke of Childish Gambino" This type of quality article 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.720
 Then, I laughed at them last week (VICE) 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.540
 I think I probably got them angry.. 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.820
 Sorry for VICE ( ;∀;) 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:46.320
 However, VICE decided to say: "We should use junk articles to prove that he is wrong!" 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.280
 Hahaha( ́∀` ) 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.300
 "Everyone listens to me...!!" 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.020
 I am this expression in the photo. 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.860
 *Exclusive broadcast* "Pewdiepie, he is teaching his audience to say that women should live" 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.920
 That's right, do you remember that movie? Everyone remembers right? 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:00.120
 Remember when I said that they should live? 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.720
 *nod* 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.180
 Of course remember ( ͡ ° ͜ʖ ͡ °) 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.920
 Better than this, I later sent the original film to Twitter. 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.920
 So everyone can go and see for themselves. 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.900
 However, I seem to have made a mistake, so VICE responded by saying: 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.500
 "Haha, you made the wrong brother." 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.600
 *☚(* ́∀`☚)* Was I caught? 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.000
 Fortunately, our article has a verbatim draft of your film. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.200
 Really, yeah, on the verbatim draft, I said that women should live. 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.600
 It’s exactly the same yeah~ exactly the same as you wrote (`Д ́) 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.060
 Thank you~ Jason 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.400
 Thank you VICE for being such an honest * report 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.400
 Thank you, not only to understand the thinking of the new generation, but also to understand what they want. 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.400
 I really want to thank you for helping me write such a persuasive verbatim manuscript. 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.760
 Very knot...excellent report 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.160
 well done. 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160
 This whole article is full of... 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.100
呃....prejudice 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.100
 His article has been trying to hint 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:04.160
 They think that I think it can be hindered, harassed and even violated by women because of women’s wear. 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.520
 I have never said this before. 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.100
 The criticisms under this report are also very classic. 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.060
 I have never seen an article with so many people before I sent Twitter. 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.500
 The best thing to laugh is that this magazine says that you understand the new generation. 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.540
 On the one hand, the article was overturned by its own audience. 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.700
 Super classic (`∀ ́ハ

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.840
 In fact, I feel that I don’t have to respond at all. 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.800
 But it should be funny, so I will respond 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.140
 "In Pewdiepie's latest film, Pewd is responsible for Alinity's complaints. 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.000
 And said that the harassment that Alinity is currently suffering is that he deserves it. " 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.400
 That's right, that's what I want to express! * I'm afraid that VICE can't understand it, so I declare that it is ironic* 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.859
 I am talking about his abuse of copyright law, he should be accepted as a sniper. 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.200
 Abuse of the law is wrong, of course you will be attacked 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.800
 This is the Internet world, of course, will receive some of the harassment 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.000
 This is not what I hope, nor will I say that anyone should be harassed. 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.039
 "...the reason she was harassed was because he was wearing a cool costume live. 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.860
 In Pewd's film, she can see a piece of underwear in a transparent top." 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.560
 * Eye barriers* 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:19.120
 The article hints that I don't like other people wearing bra straps or wearing transparent tops. 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.780
 Lie 

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.100
 I have never said these words. 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.460
 She also hinted that I hate people revealing bra straps 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.500
 This is really awkward. I have never said that it is a lie. 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.000
 Then the article says: I said she only wears a skirt to play the Just Dance dance game. 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.159
 In fact, I gave a lot of her promiscuous fragments as an example. 

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:44.719
 But they just want to mention one as if I only have one example 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.500
 Well done, VICE 

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:51.600
 In the following articles, they also said that I "out of context" ̄\_(ツ)_/ ̄ 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.400
 How to do it? ᴥ•ʔ 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.080
 The whole article is basically 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.320
 The reporter is fighting me and completely ignoring the fault of the other party. 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:01.660
 Stuffy enough 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:05.120
 "Pewd's behavior is not only speculative but disappointing 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.760
 Does this have three small benefits for me? 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.800
 do you understand? 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.179
 She is the speculative and disgusting person. Are you wrong? 

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:16.999
 *laugh* 

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.780
 Abuse of copyright law to make money is called speculation and casts aside 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.060
 What did my mother do? 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:26.380
 Then they continue to ignore all the actions of Alinity. 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.400
 Because they said that the focus of this film is not on copyright abuse. 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.960
 This is about the rights of female live owners. 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:34.960
 This is a very convenient excuse 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.880
 We can directly ignore her fault 

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.100
 Let us turn to discuss the female reality master 

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.460
 I also want to use such an excuse, I feel super convenient. 

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:49.280
 If I use another day to abuse the copyright law to complain to another person 

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.720
 I can easily guess the front page of tomorrow. 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:55.760
 If I still go to show off the abuse of copyright law, the complainant is very profitable. 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:58.220
 I believe I will get good feedback. 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.720
 If I admit that I am getting married 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.160
 I really want to know what everyone will say. 

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.140
 If I say N-words (discriminatory vocabulary), then it’s okay, I’m 10% black. 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:09.660
 Of course everyone will ignore what I did. 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:11.480
 Because that's not the point 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:13.740
 If I openly admit that day 

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:16.560
 Youtube has given me a special disclaimer 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:21.120
 There is absolutely no one who has an opinion because it is not the point. 

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:24.540
 The point is that my film is literally correct. 

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:25.220
 Uh 

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:28.960
 They said: In order to understand the beginning and end of the event 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:35.640
 You must have a look at Twitch Fails videos. You can search Twitch Fails on Youtube. 

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:38.640
 * Wear high IQ glasses* ( ́・ω・`) 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.440
 Oh, I don’t think you really understand what you are saying. 

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.440
 You want me to search Twitch Fails 

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.600
 She immediately jumped out of some subtle porn videos. 

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.659
 I hope that you are not intentional (laugh) 

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.120
 However, this is the biggest problem of Twitch. 

00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.540
 When these meats are the main and current actresses 

00:08:02.540 --> 00:08:06.280
 Lively wretched behavior on Twitch 

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:13.460
 Will overshadow those who are normal and just want to play the game. 

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:15.580
 Your example is really good. 

00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:16.580
 And I also mentioned 

00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:18.200
 I don't hate their behavior at all. 

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.660
 For example, there is a live master 

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:26.720
 The whole thing is very light. She lived for a year, just wanted to be a Twitch Partner 

00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:27.410
 Then 呃

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:32.560
 But she hasn't got Twitch Partner yet. D: But she also agrees with my point of view and some opinions. 

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.420
 "I am just squeezing my bra to let everyone know the principle of concentrating bras" 

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:37.940
 You can't materialize me. 

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.320
 [ItsSkyLOL]: It’s because of these female facts. 

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:47.780
 Many people will come to my life and hope that I will do the same thing. 

00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:52.320
 Not all female reality owners will squeeze the bra for you to see 

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:55.520
 Every time I see this girl, it makes me very upset. 

00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:58.120
 Are the stereotypes created by these people. 

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.540
 Then the film is red. 

00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:01.840
 There are now millions of views 

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:07.960
 She is doing well now, and I am very happy because there are some people who work hard to pay for this kind of thing. 

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:08.960
 Uh 

00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:10.960
 You can also get a little help 

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.900
 "After Pewd's film 

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.520
 Alinity also apologized. " 

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.520
 Did she apologize? Σ(゚Д゚;) 

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:20.380
 Wow, this is really amazing. 

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:23.260
 This ghost article I read very painful 

00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:27.600
 The reason I apologize is because I want to give Alinity a step. 

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.520
 I don't want to see her continue to be jealous. 

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.300
 I don't want to see her continue to be harassed. 

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:34.800
 I thought I gave him a chance to let go. 

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:36.800
 But it seems that she apologized ( ́∀`) 

00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.300
 Good job, VICE ( ́∀`) 

00:09:38.300 --> 00:09:40.960
 *Please applause* 

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:43.100
 This is what we want to do. 

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:44.800
 Let the game no longer harass 

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.280
 That's why no one believes in you. 

00:09:47.280 --> 00:09:48.540
 This is why 

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:49.040
 Uh 

00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:51.400
 You have already put the sheep too many times. 

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.180
 Yes, you may earn some clickthrough rate on this article. 

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:59.060
 Yes, you may feel that you are awesome. 

00:09:59.240 --> 00:10:04.580
 But in fact you are a jumping clown 

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.820
 Congratulations ☆*゚ ゚゚*( ́∀`)*゚ ゚゚*☆ 

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:07.200
 PEWPEWPEWPEWPE 

00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:11.040
 Next * one * news is also very relevant 

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:12.340
 Elon Musk, a person I admire 

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:15.940
 She has done a lot of amazing portraits of SpaceX and Tesla. 

00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.580
 She also recently had a problem with the news media. 

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.700
 She wrote on Twitter 

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:26.600
 These self-centered and hypocritical media companies always cover up lies in the name of truth. 

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.720
 No one in today’s society will respect this industry (the best) 

00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:33.000
 This sounds very similar to my situation. 

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:34.920
 Essentially the same 

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.860
 Her Twitter is talking about a press release written by Washington Post. 

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:42.780
 "Tesla automatically drives the truck until the red light stops." 

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:50.340
 Elon Musk mentioned: A fracture in a car accident on Ratsla will be on the front page. 

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:56.280
 Then more than 40,000 people died in car accidents last year but no one cares. 

00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.080
 You can argue that a Tesla accident 

00:10:59.090 --> 00:11:02.419
 Is it news? 

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:06.380
 But the interesting point is that in the past year 

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:09.200
 There is no report of a favorable Tesla 

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.539
 In the past year, our autonomous driving technology has been reduced by 40% with government support. 

00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:20.569
 Our data shows that the more road traffic, the more we will improve our driving safety. 

00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:28.099
 There is no perfect driving in the world. No matter what, there will be a problem with the Sambo. 

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:30.469
 This is a reality we have to face. 

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:35.860
 Elon Musk is doing the job of avoiding a car accident and saving lives. 

00:11:35.940 --> 00:11:39.460
 But he will still be scrutinized by the media. 

00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:48.580
 Because the media only cares about the rate of reading, they use criticism to criticize everyone except themselves. 

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.680
 Andrew Hawkins replied: 

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:57.820
 Elon Musk is just trying to cover up the facts and mislead the public against the media. 

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:02.780
 Elon Reply: I know you will say that every time someone opposes the media. You will only say that you are Trump. 

00:12:02.789 --> 00:12:08.780
 How do you think she was elected? Because no one believes in your ghosts, you have already lost credit. 

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:11.320
 *Laser laser* Well said Elon 

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:14.940
 These reporters have been under great pressure for the click rate. 

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.560
 They will be fired without a click rate. 

00:12:17.560 --> 00:12:23.780
 In this case Elon jokingly proposed a website plan called Pravda 

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:30.120
 But I think she is serious, she got a vote and asked if she wants to set up a 

00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.680
 A web page that can report the media score of a farm article 

00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:38.080
 88% agree, 12% object 

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:45.480
 "The interesting thing is that the number of opponents is gradually decreasing, but more and more people are tweeting me (thinking)" 

00:12:45.480 --> 00:12:51.620
 Basically Pravda is a website that can rate the credit level of the media. 

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.440
 A bit like Rotten Tomatoes (foreign film rating website) 

00:12:54.519 --> 00:13:01.078
 I will collect information about movies and film reviews, just this one will be about media reporters. 

00:13:01.079 --> 00:13:04.679
 This is a fun idea, let me know what you think 

00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:05.709
 PEWPEWPEWPEWPEWP- 

00:13:05.709 --> 00:13:08.460
 I want to give a big... huge thanks 

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:13.820
 Thanks to all those who supported me when the media wanted to bully me. 

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:17.620
 When I saw someone 

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:19.620
 Willing to spend time explaining for me 

00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:23.820
 Willing to calmly and objectively analyze the truth of the matter 

00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:25.820
 Even if these news are some shit 

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.460
 I am really happy to have you. 

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:32.660
 Many people like to share these sensational news and then fall into the rocks. 

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.100
 Indiscriminately say something like "I know her character is bad" 

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:41.820
 So I really appreciate your support, I really thank you guys. 

00:13:42.660 --> 00:13:43.840
 Hey and you will meet again 

00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.740
 *Jake Paul's music* 

00:13:50.620 --> 00:13:56.820
 Thank you Pewdiepie for bringing us the film (* ́∀`*)ノ

00:13:59.980 --> 00:14:00.480
 This is 0.5 seconds before the end of the movie. Why are you wasting time here ( ́∀`) σ)Д`)
