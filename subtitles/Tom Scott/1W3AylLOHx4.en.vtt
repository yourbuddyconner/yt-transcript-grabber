00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.600
 I'm here with Kevin Prince, 

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:04.260
 and I'm going to teach him something that you may not know yet, 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.900
 and that's how you have to throw a bucket of water over someone. 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.460
 Here you have the bucket. 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.680
 This is not the case if you actually want to make someone wet, 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:13.460
 because you are angry with him / her 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.760
 but this is how you throw a bucket of water 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.100
 when you are on stage. 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:19.080
 This was taught to me by a "pantomime lady" 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.520
 a few years ago when I did panto shows. 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.840
 And the most important point is 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.300
 that where you normally try to make someone as wet as possible, 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.600
 this is not the goal on a stage, 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.960
 because a large audience is watching, either on YouTube or in the theater. 

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:32.880
 So you want to go for dramatic effect 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.000
 and you also want to prevent the suit from getting soaked. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.180
 So, do you want to fill the bucket? 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.380
 Fill the bucket, there we go, 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.280
 About halfway 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:41.000
 About halfway, if so! 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.120
 Yes, that's good. 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.180
 Because if you fill it too far, 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.800
 the bucket has too much speed, and it does not work to lift it. 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.160
 Too little does not look good. 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.660
 So, you want to focus on the chin 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:50.540
 That's the trick. 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.260
 Bucket with water, focus on the chin. 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.120
 There are two reasons for this: 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.520
 First, if you hit the chest, the target is completely soaked. 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.100
 which means that you have to let the costume dry, which takes a lot of time. 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.980
 Second, 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.840
 if you hit the chin, this creates a huge splash 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.020
 what looks good to the public, 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.260
 and the person does not get very wet. 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.140
 So, are you ready? -Yes. 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.640
 All right. 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.540
 It's been a while back that I've done this for the last time. 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.040
 Ready? 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.540
 Yes 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.160
 Aim at the chin. Now! 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.000
 You missed! 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.000
 Everything above is dry! 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.060
 You... 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.340
 Do you want to try again? 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.980
 Okay, half full. 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.820
 A 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.000
 Two 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.840
 Three. 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.860
 (Large splash, visible from a great distance, minimum amount of water on clothing) 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.600
 That's how you throw a bucket of water over someone ... 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.900
 And that 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.900
 is something 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.140
 [bubbly water sound] 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.600
 Damn Mel!
