00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.200
 [Women] I think the best thing would be to start a job. 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.560
 [Girl] No no! 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:05.260
 [Doctor. Phil Yes, she needs a job. 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.940
 [Girl] No! [Wailing] 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.440
 [Chuckles of Pewdie] 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.080
 how are you guys! It's me, PewDiePie. 

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.160
 Welcome to the Week of Fun for Children 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.600
 We've come to this point, have not we? Two days running, really Felix? [Laugh] 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.640
 Listen, I was going to play a game but it did not work 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.939
 So, here we are again, the children 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.598
 You guys saw this? I heard you guys about this this? A 19-year-old girl is crying 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.269
 Because they must get a job 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.969
 What is the absolute spoiled naughty? 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.640
 Is not it nice to laugh at people? 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.520
 Especially when they cry 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:51.299
 Nicole will become 16th next month. She's dead on giving her a car. It's normal for people to get beautiful cars. 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.460
 So you want a car for $ 250,000 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.260
 $ 231,000. Nikolerstek will be 16 next month. She's dead on giving her a car. 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.480
 Have a car? I did not have a car until I was 21 years old, guys 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.560
 It's normal for people to get beautiful cars. I want one. 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.540
 It is not natural 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.200
 * Hits the wall * I am very angry. Li photographed a punch? Was it too low? 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.320
 * Hits the wall again * 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.160
 I want a Mercedes-Benz J-Wag Matte Black AMG 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.520
 I want ads on all of my videos. I want * pood laugh * 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:34.580
 I want at least five of them and I want all of my videos to be monetizable and not age-restricted. Well, this will not happen. Okay 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.880
 life is unfair. You do not always get what you want a fool at the age of fifteen 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:43.760
 Take care 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.700
 The car shakes when I do it 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.380
 Incredibly the car shakes because of the engine 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.990
 Did you know that if you put him in the gear, she could move too 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.709
 My favorite part is the doors because they are only huge and then they have this designer. She likes line design 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.840
 Sorry, I realize I'm nitpicking but there's plenty to p- * More bio laugh * 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.140
 There is a lot of focus on sorry, 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.940
 Can we go back? She loves everyone's line? 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.240
 Yes, why do you like this car? 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.080
 It has a line on the side. Love her. Absol- this wall by the way. It's uh uh white 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.310
 I absolutely love it. 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.830
 I love the design here 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.080
 Now I'm thinking that I really need a red and black Louis Vuitton Palm Springs backpack to go with this 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.720
 I think I understood the second amendment now, I think I understand 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.560
 I may need the bus to work every day so I can buy G-Wagon AMG matte black 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.960
 Well, you're right 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.280
 Do not buy it then you shmuck absolute 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.880
 I need it. Yes. Why do you want a car worth $ 231,000? 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.840
 Because I can get it. I want G-Wagon more than ever before 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.320
 I'm not kidding 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.980
 The exact G-Wagon I want is $ 231,000. I'm a princess. I definitely deserved it 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.380
 you know 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.610
 This theory has long been that we only need to send children to an island where they fight for their lives 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.329
 And only their strength will come out alive 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:15.780
 At a very early age, Nicolet had its own credit cards, but without credit limits. (You dumbf * absolute ck) 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.340
 Some of its most popular credit card bonds will be ten thousand. I just paid the bill 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.700
 * Irony like Indian soap opera * Sometimes the bill has ten thousand paid bill 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.920
 Why did you pay it? Listen? To cash a deal well, I can be your daughter for half that amount (same) 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.459
 I realize that I should start reducing because this is out of control 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.940
 That went just like tons of bricks. right Now. Monthly spending allowance is $ 1000 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.890
 I feel like a peasant 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.169
 You know I did not think I could find anyone else annoying to replace Tai's night but I think we did it 

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:47.920
 We did it, young people. Well done 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.020
 I can not live like this anymore I'm always money 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:56.360
 If you ask me I think my mom should give me at least 2500 a month to cover my basic expenses 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.240
 2500? 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.240
 When are you 15 years old? 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.320
 Yes. Looks like this sounds like * really jarring * 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.980
 Do you agree that you agree to the right? Yes sure 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.690
 So our introduction now goes on Dr. Phil 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.040
 But at first they always provide parents 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.720
 You've celebrated his thirteenth birthday, you buy designer clothes, right? 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:20.038
 Yes really. Membership Gym with personal trainer, $ 100 per hour 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.480
 * * haptepatchapatchhaeweaptcapacha 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.340
 $ 100 ... per hour ... your coach at the gym 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.189
 Membership Gym was a personal trainer for one hundred dollars an hour now, guys 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.829
 I never used to call a 15-year-old girl and say she was overweight. I just would not do that. Okay? 

00:04:40.829 --> 00:04:42.039
 I love red and black a lot 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:48.029
 right Now. All I'm saying is where do you go? I just compared my sister 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.720
 And then 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:57.279
 Finally she entered as she spoke with legendary legend Bill Bell 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.140
 I do not like what I see 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:00.100
 You created me 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.460
 I created a monster 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:06.900
 It's even psychology about how horrible and disgusting they are. 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.140
 You created me, Mom 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.840
 It's like a kind of curious circus with a wild face 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.840
 * * yumadedisyumadediss 

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:21.180
 I do not like what I see. You created ... I 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.340
 I've created a naughty Beverly Hills. 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:24.969
 Why do you think it is this way? 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.920
 I think I made it this way 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.700
 You did it, you educated me, you should have the best education 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.560
 * ooooooooohhhhhhhhh * * Absolutely wild, girl !!!! * 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.560
 oooooofh! 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:40.440
 Full blame conversion 

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.620
 who is this? ALINITYYY ??? 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:47.300
 It is not my fault that I am a terrible man is your fault * 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:53.500
 You must become a streamer. She will do great. What do you think she should have done? What do you think? She had to do it. Did not I? 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:55.500
 I do not know. I never loved as a child 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:56.940
 * Hahaha * 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.940
 * * * 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:04.420
 I've never heard an audience laugh at someone to say that. 

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:08.520
 I do not know. I never liked it. * Satanic laugh * 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:15.900
 I'm sure there is some inherent psychological damage to this girl, but everyone hates her a lot 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.120
 It does not just matter, it's a beautiful thing we can celebrate it all 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.449
 Do you really feel that way? 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:24.800
 Dr. Phil * pewds silent laugh * 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.420
 Do you really feel that I do not believe you, brutal. Do you really feel that I do not believe you Savage 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:34.720
 Do you really feel this way Have you ever looked at someone wondering what is going on inside their heads? Do you really feel this way Have you ever looked at someone wondering what is going on inside their heads? 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.240
 Strange strange laugh 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:38.900
 * I'am Illiterate * 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.020
 * Satanic screams * 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.020
 How are people treated? 

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.280
 I'm like a peasant 

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.700
 I did not know Ben Shapiro had a sister 

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:52.379
 But have nothing to do with not having the right material idea. I have my bags 

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:55.030
 what do you mean? 

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.030
 My bag is my friends 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.440
 These are not friends that are rigid things. 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.480
 Dr. Phil is always there to close it. 

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:06.480
 Sorry, this is not a friend 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.340
 This is the table you wash 

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.640
 I just love how to say it in such a monotonous tune. 

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.620
 Sorry, you have no friends at all. Just admit it already 

00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:17.660
 You wrote to me 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.780
 Tell me what you want me to talk to your mother. 

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:21.820
 wait! 

00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:24.440
 I asked to be on d. Elephant 

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:28.300
 Wait a minute 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:33.539
 I want my mother to understand that I can not live for $ 1000 a month and have grown up in a certain lifestyle 

00:07:33.699 --> 00:07:38.038
 Can not take this away from me immediately. If someone took his lifestyle away from them 

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:43.169
 She did not like it and grew up on it. all what I know. I can not handle this 

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.280
 So I came to you for help. 

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:46.780
 Okay 

00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:47.820
 * Shot * * Daughter thanking * 

00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.640
 Wait, so I went to Dr. Phil to tell Dr. Phil 

00:07:52.649 --> 00:07:56.620
 They do not get enough money, and they actually think they have a case there 

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:01.740
 I smell a smell. She wants to give me a Mercedes. C-class. Uh 

00:08:01.740 --> 00:08:03.740
 * dorrr * * aaahhhh * 

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:10.420
 I will accept that car 

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:13.400
 I will be happy with this car 

00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:13.900
 bitch 

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:16.220
 Ohhhhhhhh 

00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:18.480
 I WANT THE G-WAGON 

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:21.380
 I will not drive anything that can be considered UberX 

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.340
 - What? 

00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:23.910
 And UberX 

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.420
 And UberX? 

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.880
 Yes, we will go UberLUX and above 

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:31.960
 * Bio-injection * My God 

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:35.480
 I hate this girl at all 

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:38.140
 * I too, poods * 

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.240
 My God 

00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:46.840
 Violence, pain and torture, these things are all logical for me now. All this is clear to me 

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:53.480
 I fully understand. I think the best thing is to start a job. Yeah. at all. She needs a job 

00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:57.060
 NOOOOOO !!!!!!!! * Maybe a fake cry * 

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.060
 OHHHHH Here comes the tears 

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:01.240
 * * hohohohohoh 

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:07.820
 I think it would be nice if you volunteered more in the soup kitchen you can do some wonderful volunteer work there 

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:09.820
 * More tears everybodeeh * 

00:09:09.839 --> 00:09:14.208
 You know, there will be when I am I can not support myself on YouTube anymore 

00:09:14.208 --> 00:09:17.700
 Very soon from the hit hit the bell button please guys please 

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:19.780
 What do you mean I have to get a real job 

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:24.080
 * nooooo nooooo nooohooho! * 

00:09:24.080 --> 00:09:24.960
 No! 

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:27.740
 It's a new job at home. See you post in the world 

00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:29.740
 of course not 

00:09:29.740 --> 00:09:31.220
 * Peeking * 

00:09:31.220 --> 00:09:33.220
 So there you have it all 

00:09:34.489 --> 00:09:37.298
 Copy them all to fake everyone 

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:43.680
 She is a representative. There is no fifteen years of age written to d. Phil says unusually that they want more money 

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:48.020
 This does not happen. So crying does not seem true, true 

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.740
 * Fantastic fake * 

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.460
 I mean I saw some ugly crying but my God 

00:09:54.460 --> 00:09:59.259
 What do you think of leaving like if you think it's real and leave like if you think men are fake? thank you 

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.380
 Lots to watch another video
