00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.600
I'm about to play Bubble Football

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.360
which, let's be honest, is possibly one of the most ridiculous games of football it's possible to play

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.100
but is it not the most ridiculous game of football in history.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:19.340
That goes to 1994 and the Carribean Cup match between Barbados and Grenada.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.260
When [WHISTLE] oh blimey -- Barbados went into that match -- aaugh!

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.140
You know what?, I'm gonna tell this story later!

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.420
The 1994 Carribean cup. It is Barbados vs. Grenada.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.380
Barbados need to win by two clear goals in order to qualify, just winning isn't good enough.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.600
So, in they go. By halfway through the match they're up 2-0, but, with just seven minutes left

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.040
Grenada pull one back and it is 2-1. Which means Barbados, despite winning the match,

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.920
ain't going through, they haven't won by two clear goals.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.680
Now, there is a stupid rule in this particular tournament, that if a match is drawn,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.120
it goes to extra time, overtime as the Americans would call it, and then ends on the first goal,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.240
which counts double, which counts for two.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:08.840
So Barbados realise, hold on, we're 2-1 down, if we just score an own goal,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.620
equalise the score, we're gonna have half an hour of extra time in which we just need to score one goal

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.660
to go through because of this stupid doubling rule.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.860
So they do. They tap it back and forth and then ... own goal, in their own net.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.920
2-2. And then, with just three minutes left, Grenada realise, hold on, they need to win by two goals!

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.160
It doesn't matter whether the score is 3-2 or 2-3, we'll go through either way,

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.800
as long as we score somewhere! So, with three minutes, Grenada are desperately trying to score

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.980
either a goal or an own goal, because both will let them through. And they don't manage it.

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.480
It goes to extra time, Barbados score the golden goal and Barbados go through.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.600
And the moral of the story is this: If you want to avoid ridiculous games of football,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.520
or any kind of game, if you're changing the rules, make sure you test them thoroughly first

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.340
for what economists call "perverse incentives".

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.800
And if you want a ridiculous game of football then I thoroughly recommend that.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.120
Just remember to wear contacts.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.700
That hurt(!)

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.400
That ... believe it or not, is something from the world of sport -- which I don't think I've covered before --

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.400
that you might not have known.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.420
