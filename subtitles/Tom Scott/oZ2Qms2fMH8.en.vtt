00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.420
 I will be honest to you, this video will be quite disappointing. 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.460
 Because when I discovered that there are sundial that work 24 hours a day, 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.499
 I said I was filming them, but then ... 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:16.039
 However, in clear weather, these hours work 24 hours a day. Or at least, 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.259
 after 3 months of the year. Because these hours are in Longyerbyen, Svalbard, 

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.050
 In the Arctic Circle, and now it should be midnight. 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.949
 We have a summer equinox and we are so far north that even now, 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:34.320
 just before midnight, so I whisper, the sun is still in the sky. And he stays there for another 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.070
 few months. It will come out and fit, but it will never fall behind the horizon. And what is important, 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.940
 it will never be too high in the sky: this part of our Planet is never pointed 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.030
 towards the sun, so the sun always appears low and close to the horizon. 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.220
 For this reason the gnomon - here the part that casts the shadow - is steep, steeper than 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.170
 on regular sunshine, anywhere in the world. 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.360
 And here we have one really smart idea that makes sense only on sunny hours like these. 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.330
 Most sundial have a gap at noon: you have to count the thickness of the shadow of the gnomon, 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:06.140
 so in the morning you read the shadow and the afternoon from the other. 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.000
 Shadow skips a gap in the middle. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.870
 But these clocks also work at midnight, so they have to jump back at some point. 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.460
 That is why the scale exceeds the scale. This problem would also be solved by a very thin gnomon, 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:24.750
 but such would probably not survive 4 months of Arctic nights, 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.450
 when hours will not work at all. 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:34.460
 It's just 1 am in the morning, we're halfway home, one mile from our hotel. 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.909
 And it was just clear.
