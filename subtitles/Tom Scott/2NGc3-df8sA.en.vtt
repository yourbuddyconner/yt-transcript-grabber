00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.550
 At Eden Project is the world's largest indoor rainforest. 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:10.310
 a plant has built up energy for many, many years, 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.599
 and is about to finish it, over 48 nasty hours. 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.300
 This is a carcass flower and it smells of death. 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.460
 It's like a dead rat, mixed with rotten fish. 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.580
 Some people describe it as a garbage container that has not been emptied for two or three weeks. 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.879
 It smells of decay. 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:39.159
 These plants use flies and beetles in the same way as other plants use bees: pollination. 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:43.059
 The smell of death: it is very attractive to flies and beetles 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:45.339
 looking for a place to lay eggs. 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.670
 These bloom only when they have built enough energy, 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.889
 And it can take anywhere between 7 and 10 years. 

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:56.350
 Titanium arum blooms only for 48 hours. 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.889
 On the first night, it can only receive pollen. 

00:00:59.889 --> 00:01:05.309
 The second night, it releases pollen. It cannot pollinate itself. 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.400
 Over time, evolution will move species towards strategies 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.810
 with the greatest chance of success. 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.310
 And immediately the cadaver flower's strategy does not seem to be particularly good: 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.500
 only 48 hours after the year's wait. 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.870
 I mean, of course, it would be a better idea to reproduce as often as possible. 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.720
 And there are many plants that do, which everyone with pollen allergy knows. 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.010
 But there is another possible strategy: 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:33.200
 build energy for many, many years, 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.300
 and burn it all over a couple of nights 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.410
 to send out a mating call so large that it can smell miles away. 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.130
 It uses heat to make the smell go further afield. 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.140
 These plants are thermogenic. They generate their own heat. 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.460
 And they reach up to body temperature. 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.229
 It is capable of sending scents over the crowns of the rain forest, 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.200
 where it can catch a breeze. 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.080
 And insects can therefore smell the blossom, over 3,000 meters away. 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.259
 It is the same temperature as a dying animal, 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:14.450
 and the smell is like rotten meat. And - if you try to come here - 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.989
 this is the color we normally see in the butcher. 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.849
 It's the color of meat. 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.870
 So in many ways, it lures flies and beetles, 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.230
 to believe they have found a carcass. 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.909
 Which leaves us with the issue of smell. 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.999
 So, I came a few hours late, 

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.579
 it is obviously over the worst, but ... 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.139
 ... Yes. Yeah okay. It is bad! It is... 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:47.029
 Many thanks to the Eden Project for inviting me. 

00:02:47.029 --> 00:02:49.469
 They have a YouTube channel you can check out, 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.620
 and they are open year round in Cornwall, in south-west England.
