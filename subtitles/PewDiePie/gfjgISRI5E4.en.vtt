 First of all, peace be upon you, this is an infidel, do not disobey him, drink wine, and start a translation 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.500
 Whiskeyeyeye 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.280
 This video, which I once excited excited, if you follow me Balstqrm repent to God and was canceled follow-up from the first (which I have to start with meaning) 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.480
 Or any social media (which is necessary), you know that I like a drink at the back of the deer 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.215
 And my favorite back-to-back drink 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.880
 A syrup of the Japanese gazelle, which is the thing that I drink today! 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.340
 This video of the videos that I do not know if I thought sweet and no costume to drink it, but salvation I want to drink Mera enthusiast Hjug Hug 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.420
 As such, I started with a bouquet of gazelle, a good original Japanese brand 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.100
 For me the best brand, I could just be chosen because I love Japan but 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.445
 Ummmm ok, we have on the left side Ummm Shamesh 

00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:43.335
 Aye, syrup back of the Centaur deer 

00:00:44.165 --> 00:00:45.785
 Do not bother, here begins to occupy the largest polytheism 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.280
 On the right side we have a drink ... 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.640
 This money his mother entered 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:55.740
 We have a drink of the most valuable sheep, (the words can be understood as difficult to translate) These two drinkers (the sheep and the rear of the deer) are the largest distillation distillers, Umm (Kalaj many) companies choose 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.820
 Maalish in Japan (and God Mavhmt and say) the sheep and the second named by that 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:06.700
 All of them are completely different from each other, but the first one was manufactured juice Juicer pig and I have one copy 12 years old and taste taste 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.680
 Which is a name. 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:15.220
 After two years we have 18 years old Laura, this was me and I never tried it, I did not have a juice drink Abu 18 years Lori 

00:01:15.225 --> 00:01:18.080
 Because they are so bitter, a drink in the back of the Centaur deer 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:26.160
 You may have heard of the film "Lost in Translation" by Bill Murray, who has settled his statement about how I mean you 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.055
 Relaxation time 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.840
 Cell time back of Centaur deer 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.740
 Because, as I said, we have left the juice of the pig because it is older than the oldest of the oldest wine 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.895
 It dates back to 1923 AD 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.160
 I started in that history, this is older, I think it is the oldest distilled pig juice in Japan 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:46.615
 I do not know for sure. The fact that strange phases if you say differences between the stupid versions, 

00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:52.115
 But I will just say about any whiskey really. It's very nicey 

00:01:55.275 --> 00:01:58.095
 It gives me a very sweet palate. I'll just like it's very nice. I love how they keep bottles simple. Just fucking that all. 

00:02:05.685 --> 00:02:06.685
 Okay... 

00:02:09.345 --> 00:02:10.435
 Enter there. The dats will work pretty girl. We have a lot of stuff to try so just let 

00:02:19.035 --> 00:02:20.315
 so sweet. It's got * tasting sounds * Aoki taste so very beautiful 

00:02:28.265 --> 00:02:30.345
 I would give it seven "very nice" s. 

00:02:30.755 --> 00:02:32.505
 We have 18 years 

00:02:32.965 --> 00:02:35.925
 Let's just get great guns right away. Very nice, I got Centuri on the back. 

00:02:35.925 --> 00:02:38.815
 18 years. This bottle, guess how much it costs, Marzia? 

00:02:43.515 --> 00:02:45.435
 damn it. did I tell you? 

00:02:45.905 --> 00:02:46.905
 It's 500. It's so crazy 

00:02:47.485 --> 00:02:50.545
 I think in Japan you will get it for a hundred and twenty. I have not spent this almost almost on whiskey 

00:02:54.615 --> 00:02:56.565
 I like nervous so try it. 

00:02:57.175 --> 00:02:58.685
 Oh smell. she is beautiful 

00:03:07.035 --> 00:03:09.065
 You can definitely tell the difference. Taste more smooth, you can really feel more. It's just a beautiful whiskey 

00:03:13.755 --> 00:03:16.465
 very nice. very nice. I like this, and this is fun 

00:03:16.465 --> 00:03:19.525
 The next one that came out was Hibeki. This is not the age whiskey 

00:03:22.545 --> 00:03:25.065
 It's cheap, I think it's a mix, as well as a delicate mix of the finest whiskey types 

00:03:27.985 --> 00:03:31.215
 But the hippie is very good. I think a lot - if you know Japanese whiskey you'll definitely know about 

00:03:34.035 --> 00:03:36.955
 Hypeki would like to pour maybe a little less 

00:03:39.955 --> 00:03:42.965
 We got a lot of whiskey to go through you gonna make it to the video, but it started early 

00:03:51.445 --> 00:03:53.295
 I mean, they all taste very nice. It gives uh, taste. It's kind of taste 

00:03:56.605 --> 00:03:58.655
 That hits you when you have in your mouth 

00:03:58.655 --> 00:04:01.565
 Then there is a taste when swallowing (that's what she said);) 

00:04:01.565 --> 00:04:04.665
 And it's much more superior in this one compared to the hippie, although the taste of all of them is actually quite similar. 

00:04:08.575 --> 00:04:11.495
 Maya You can be quiet, or do you want some whiskey? 

00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:13.795
 Then we have Hakusho, aged in the forest 

00:04:14.705 --> 00:04:16.325
 Thus green Oh 

00:04:16.775 --> 00:04:19.935
 Bottle and all that shit. Third Hakusho, Hakusho? 

00:04:24.545 --> 00:04:25.545
 Beautiful. I love the bottle, is not it beautiful? 

00:04:28.645 --> 00:04:29.815
 Yes, you do not want it? 

00:04:30.495 --> 00:04:33.475
 love it. It's very, it's got a very light color for it. This is another one of Centauri 

00:04:39.565 --> 00:04:40.655
 Stop 

00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:43.265
 That flavor is very different! 

00:04:43.725 --> 00:04:46.195
 I really liked that Hakusho. I think I'll get one old at the next time 

00:04:46.195 --> 00:04:49.385
 I think it's the same thing here. Since this is not old, you do not hit by this taste then the same way you like 

00:04:55.075 --> 00:04:58.095
 This is very nice. I give this one 

00:04:58.095 --> 00:05:01.085
 Very 7 - Very Nice s8 Very Nice s7 Very Nice for that. This is a 6 "very nice" 

00:05:05.205 --> 00:05:08.165
 Now we are moving to Nika! Which unfortunately I just got two of them, one I 

00:05:08.165 --> 00:05:11.315
 I'm done. I have a little bit of this one. Yoachi was the first one 

00:05:13.815 --> 00:05:16.485
 They made, so Nika was made by the legendary Japanese whiskey maker 

00:05:22.495 --> 00:05:25.585
 Takeshuru? His name is Masataka Taketsuru. So this guy was like ... "I want to make whiskey!" 

00:05:28.615 --> 00:05:31.595
 So he went to Scotland to study it, and then met - his main family met Rita 

00:05:32.785 --> 00:05:36.105
 And then - who was also studying the manufacture of whiskey, then returned to Japan 

00:05:41.955 --> 00:05:45.025
 Joined the Centauri team, he now like to fuck you guys. I'm gonna make my own brand 

00:05:45.025 --> 00:05:48.165
 So he made Nika, and the first one they did was Yoashi 

00:05:48.555 --> 00:05:51.725
 1934, so 

00:05:51.725 --> 00:05:54.735
 Centauri's age, but Ni-I think Nika is 

00:05:56.905 --> 00:05:58.155
 It's cooler b) 

00:05:58.995 --> 00:06:01.955
 So, they made Yoashi and tried to recreate 

00:06:01.955 --> 00:06:04.695
 The same thing they did in Scotland 

00:06:06.115 --> 00:06:09.015
 same status. They have it on there making on the island, like the southern island, I think? 

00:06:11.565 --> 00:06:14.945
 Which is just as big as Scotland on the coast 

00:06:15.015 --> 00:06:17.765
 They wanted to be as authentic as Scotchotec as possible, and Scotch is literally whiskey only, but it's made in 

00:06:22.365 --> 00:06:23.395
 Scotland 

00:06:26.125 --> 00:06:29.445
 Yes, but that should only be called scotch 

00:06:32.145 --> 00:06:34.635
 Brolli will not taste good because I left too much air in this bottle should not do it 

00:06:36.965 --> 00:06:38.355
 Yeah, I got something here, huh 

00:06:39.595 --> 00:06:41.385
 Well, it was good. End it 

00:06:41.935 --> 00:06:44.975
 Welcome to I will critique alcoholism. 

00:06:48.865 --> 00:06:51.815
 Yoashi gets eight and a half "very nice" s 

00:06:51.815 --> 00:06:54.895
 Curse ~ Tongue bites 

00:06:55.285 --> 00:06:56.285
 very nice. Eight and a half. I would almost say that it is better than this one 

00:07:01.745 --> 00:07:03.065
 This is a cheap one 

00:07:03.775 --> 00:07:07.205
 It's not old. The other I have is Nika Barley Coffee 

00:07:07.905 --> 00:07:10.815
 Which, if you like whiskey .. 

00:07:10.815 --> 00:07:13.235
 I recommend you tried it out, it's very different. It's not coffee. It is named after Koura, an investor or something like that 

00:07:19.495 --> 00:07:22.515
 But I feel that tastes like coffee. I may be paranoid. I feel I thought it was - "Oh 

00:07:22.515 --> 00:07:25.535
 So it's like a coffee flavor " 

00:07:25.535 --> 00:07:28.205
 It's made of corn 

00:07:28.325 --> 00:07:31.615
 on the principle. It's also cheap, if you want to get it 

00:07:32.775 --> 00:07:35.705
 Something. I feel - I do not want to spoil the facts. I feel bad if I like, 

00:07:37.485 --> 00:07:40.815
 Get something wrong. Maybe I got some wrong things, but yes, that is 

00:07:42.705 --> 00:07:44.965
 One coffee. If you remember it is true, they smell nice. I think it smells very nice 

00:07:55.505 --> 00:07:58.555
 I do not know if you can even tell them apart at this point 

00:07:59.115 --> 00:08:01.855
 They are all very good 

00:08:01.855 --> 00:08:03.085
 I'll give it seven "very nice". It gets seven strong gets "very nice". So this is a combination 

00:08:07.095 --> 00:08:09.045
 One barley, one barley, one barley, one barley, so it's made of the same 

00:08:12.895 --> 00:08:15.625
 Any one, this one? It's a mix. One barley was not used to be very popular. When they started this was not really anything 

00:08:18.585 --> 00:08:21.775
 But now it's like, if you want good whiskey you probably want one barley 

00:08:21.775 --> 00:08:24.635
 I think there are lots of great mixes too. Do not get me no fault 

00:08:27.685 --> 00:08:30.645
 Which actually brings me to the final that is Togushi 

00:08:30.645 --> 00:08:33.695
 Which I could not find any information about. It's kind of a ~ ~ mysterious bottle 

00:08:38.265 --> 00:08:41.265
 They actually do not have their own distillation .. they're not - '' Awa. Is this 18 years old? I did not even know! 

00:08:46.635 --> 00:08:50.055
 So I have 18 years of age 

00:08:50.495 --> 00:08:53.245
 You'll see it oh 

00:08:53.245 --> 00:08:55.435
 Canadian writing on it. Because they import from Scotland and Canada 

00:08:56.035 --> 00:08:59.385
 whiskey. Then they mixed brilliantly in Tooguchi. love it. Look at the bottle, it's very beautiful 

00:09:01.985 --> 00:09:04.565
 It's kind of a-if I remember correctly it has a herbal taste for it? Which does not look good 

00:09:08.035 --> 00:09:11.035
 But it's very .. I'm very happy I did not finish this bottle. Hey this one grew on me. 

00:09:14.965 --> 00:09:18.465
 I did not like it at first, but then - well 

00:09:23.155 --> 00:09:25.405
 Yes, it's just that weird ... taste like nature 

00:09:28.895 --> 00:09:31.825
 It's really good. It's very different from any of these like this 

00:09:31.825 --> 00:09:35.305
 I could not really say that far to be honest. This one definitely has a unique - I can not believe she is 18 years old 

00:09:38.635 --> 00:09:40.945
 I have no idea! This is madness. So conclude my 

00:09:44.265 --> 00:09:47.245
 Japanese 

00:09:47.245 --> 00:09:49.905
 Whiskey we got Centauri. We arrived in Nika 

00:09:49.905 --> 00:09:52.225
 I wish I could bring more Nika, my favorite Nika is Nika from the barrel. 

00:09:54.285 --> 00:09:56.795
 I would really recommend that one. check it out 

00:09:56.995 --> 00:10:00.365
 If you want - if you like, "Oh, I do not know which one to get! I want to start" Try this one. It's very good 

00:10:00.365 --> 00:10:03.325
 She got a lota alcohol in it * Click * Got a good kick for it. Now we'll be testing 

00:10:05.485 --> 00:10:06.915
 I feel like. You will have to prepare a blind test 

00:10:10.855 --> 00:10:14.265
 I mean, color is already a dead gift, right? This one is darker, right? Or maybe? 

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:21.995
 If I had to guess just looking, I would say this is 18, that is 

00:10:24.285 --> 00:10:25.285
 12 

00:10:25.665 --> 00:10:27.225
 So why not start with this one? 

00:10:32.525 --> 00:10:35.185
 I do not want to mess this up. It's like 50/50 

00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:45.225
 it is good. It's very good. You can say yes, I can say it is Yamazaki because it contains this cherry 

00:10:49.295 --> 00:10:51.945
 It's not even cherry her more- 

00:10:51.945 --> 00:10:54.955
 Y-You can taste the casket, which does not look good at all but, has a strong flavor in this one actually 

00:10:54.955 --> 00:10:57.625
 Maybe this was 18 years old. I do not know. I do not know I need to try this one 

00:11:01.155 --> 00:11:02.635
 Come on. What do I win? 

00:11:03.645 --> 00:11:04.645
 Marzia: Nothing! 

00:11:06.125 --> 00:11:08.415
 this is difficult. Here is the need. I want to go with my intuition 

00:11:10.865 --> 00:11:13.425
 Who tells me this is 12 years old ... no the opposite, the flavor says m this is 18 .. well 

00:11:16.245 --> 00:11:17.385
 This is 18. 

00:11:18.105 --> 00:11:19.105
 I see?! 

00:11:21.505 --> 00:11:24.155
 Well, actually I get a lot of questions like "Oh, I want to try whiskey, I do not try Jack Dazs and I tried 

00:11:27.275 --> 00:11:30.385
 Jameson, "but this is like saying," Oh, I love burgers, but I'm 'I love - I try McDonald's and Burger King " 

00:11:36.445 --> 00:11:39.375
 Listen, there is this whole beautiful world 

00:11:39.375 --> 00:11:42.425
 Waiting for you, well, Centauri and Nika. Thank you both. God bless you Japan. Lord protects you. Thank you so much 

00:11:45.755 --> 00:11:48.745
 Leave like if you enjoyed, I do not know whether this is the video - 

00:11:51.985 --> 00:11:55.015
 Okay. Thank you for watching leave like if you enjoyed and wanted to do next scotch, 

00:11:55.015 --> 00:11:57.815
