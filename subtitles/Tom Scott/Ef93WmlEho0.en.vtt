00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.580
 `1 if you drive on a section of the California desert 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:05.110
 You will hear a piece of music 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.340
 It should sound like this: 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.460
 (Rosini, "William Tell Overture") 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.480
 However, it sounds like this. 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.180
 Just now is the music road in Lancaster, California. 

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.680
 As you can hear, this sounds a bit out of tune. 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.520
 This road has spent a lot of money to build 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.840
 This is a publicity stunt of a car company. 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.840
 I want to show off how smart they are. 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.160
 The mathematical calculation in the calculation is really not very difficult 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.460
 A note is the specific frequency of vibration in the air 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.989
 These vibration frequencies can be synthesized by violin strings or by computer 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:01.120
 Or in this case, the car tire hits the groove of the road and causes 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:05.209
 The closer the grooves are, the faster the vibration and the higher the notes. 

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:06.579
 Therefore, the speed limit will be 

00:01:06.579 --> 00:01:09.069
 Divide by the frequency of the note you want 

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:11.829
 This is the distance of each groove 

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:14.929
 If people are driving at the wrong speed, it should not be a real problem. 

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:18.770
 It will only speed up or slow down like any other music 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.560
 Although it will go out of tune, it is still no problem for most peopleâ€™s ears. 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.279
 It won't sound like that road 

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:27.979
 So, what went wrong? 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.479
 At this point, I want to thank David Simmons Dafen. 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.259
 Assistant Professor of Physics at the California Institute of Technology 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:37.280
 Proficient in quantum field theory and La Baroque violin 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.139
 Because he, as far as I know 

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:42.929
 Is the first person to study what went wrong. 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.270
 And the problem may be the language of English. 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.799
 The person doing the calculation says that the grooves should be far apart 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.170
 For example the first note (separated by four inches) (10 cm) 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.450
 And they said there should be a groove every four inches. 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.169
 However, the person who gave instructions to the construction staff said 

00:01:58.169 --> 00:02:00.800
 The grooves should be four inches apart 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:07.100
 This is interpreted as the groove tail is four inches from the other groove head. 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.759
 They did not add the width of the groove itself 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.140
 However, your ears absolutely contain those errors. 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:17.540
 The highest note in The William Tell Overture 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.750
 Should be one octave higher than the lowest pitch 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:21.780
 This means that the frequency should be doubled 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.739
 And the distance between the grooves should be halved 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:29.290
 They are indeed. If you don't include the width of the groove itself. 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.909
 This error means that each note is not only a small part of the distortion 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.599
 Just like if you are driving at the wrong speed 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.930
 But a constant quantity: the distance between the slot and the slot 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.560
 The higher the note, the greater the impact, the more serious the tone 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.910
 The result is that the second time you listened to the chaos 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:47.629
 And the strangest part is... 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:51.469
 This is the second music road built in Lancaster, California. 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.370
 The first one was built by a car company because it was too close to the dwellings. 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.140
 Residents often complain about continuous noise 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.420
 Probably this note 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.600
 So the city government paved it up and rebuilt it... 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.420
 Take the exact, same, wrong blueprint. 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.860
 This is once (number of shots) 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.880
 Just there 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.200
 And to celebrate, I plan to step on the throttle. 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.139
 This is a recreational vehicle 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.180
 It doesn't, uh... it didn't do it.
