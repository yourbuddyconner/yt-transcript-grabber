00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.040
 This is one of the Personal Rapid Transit vehicles at London Heathrow Airport. 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.640
 It will take you from one of the parking places to Terminal 5, 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.720
 and from Terminal 5 to one of the parking spaces. 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:10.791
 And that's about it. 

00:00:10.791 --> 00:00:12.430
 When it was installed in 2011, 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.139
 this was the future of transport. 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.460
 But it did not go that well. 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.630
 And worse: 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.169
 this had been done 35 years earlier. 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.810
 Because in 1975, West Virginia University opened this: 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.369
 their own Personal Rapid Transit system. 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.100
 The vehicles here in the town of Morgantown may not be so flashy and rounded ... 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.360
 but there are 70 pieces, more people are going, 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.430
 and they go to five different stations along a track of 12.5 kilometers. 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.810
 This is really personal transport: you press a button, 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.960
 and a cart arrives to take you wherever you want, non-stop. 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.370
 During the rush hour a trolley comes every few minutes 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.950
 for each chosen destination 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.380
 The PRT never stands still. 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.210
 We have been transporting for 40 years without any major incident. 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.280
 25 centimeters of snow and everything is still flawless. 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.140
 That is because we have a heated track here. 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.989
 Children do not like it, because the school stays open! 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.049
 There are no variables; if I go from point A to point B, 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.200
 if it were eight minutes, it will take eight minutes. 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.689
 In 1970, the only option for students to travel 

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.399
 between all different university campuses, there was a fleet of buses. 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.590
 But Morgantown is a city with steep hills and narrow roads, 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.170
 so the result was that the traffic was stuck. 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.259
 And at that time 

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:25.389
 American politicians were a bit crazy about systems like this. 

00:01:25.389 --> 00:01:28.479
 Richard Nixon announced that development subsidy was available, 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.180
 and a senator from West Virginia, Robert Byrd, 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.920
 who was particularly known for how much money he managed to get back to his own state, 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.049
 he managed to select Morgantown as a test area. 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.240
 Boeing and NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.590
 were working on this system. 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.939
 The current system can handle more than 4,000 passengers per hour. 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:54.709
 Every vehicle, when it leaves a station, has a route. 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:57.859
 Every time a vehicle goes over a detector, 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.859
 this is registered by the electronics 

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:04.579
 Which then send this to a central control room, 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:09.220
 and then that message is displayed on a big screen in that room. 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.920
 And all those flashing lights are detectors, 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.750
 but they also symbolize 5 seconds of travel time. 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.250
 In the world of trains the route is determined on the track. 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.460
 So the track moves physically 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.990
 to send a vehicle another track. 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.840
 In our system, the vehicle itself determines which way it goes. 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.840
 The result of all that work in the seventies ... 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.150
 Well, that was huge about budget and a bit rough in the beginning, 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.000
 but that happens with prototypes. 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.530
 The important thing: it works 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.850
 And it worked well enough to expand and keep up to the 21st century. 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.840
 One of the problems we have today 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.840
 is the aging of parts for the vehicle, 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.070
 as well as for the electronics of the system. 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.900
 In the 70s the Minuteman was missile system 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:05.570
 the basis for the electronics of this system. 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.560
 And there is a company called Thalys, 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.090
 and they are now working on upgrading the electronics and software of the system. 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.870
 The old system uses slightly different technology to guide the carts over the track. 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.520
 The carts do not know where they are on the track. 

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.400
 In the new system, the Thalys system, they will know where they are. 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.500
 That helps enormously if you want to know where a car is. 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.880
 The technical manual of this system is on the website of the WVU, 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.280
 and it's brilliant for the 70s. 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.280
 Like the "pods" at Heathrow decades later, 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.380
 this should be the future of transport. 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.840
 But, why did not that happen? 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.680
 Why do not systems like this exist everywhere? 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.100
 Well, in most cases you can do almost anything with normal trams 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.600
 with less costs and less political risk. 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.180
 Of course, the PRT is slightly faster and more efficient, 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.830
 and it is a little more pleasant to drive, 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.240
 because every trip is non-stop - 

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.150
 but the rest of the world went for cheaper 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.940
 simpler systems ... with less charm. 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.569
 It is the backbone of our transport network. 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.100
 It is also an icon for this institute. 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.680
 We have a number of challenges, 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.630
 but we have great staff, a dedicated, passionate group 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:21.630
 who simply find a way to keep this system working. 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.010
 It's a bit like "the little engine that could" [a British children's story] 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.410
 Thanks to everyone from the Morgantown PRT and the University of West Virginia. 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.150
 Look in the description for more information about them, and about the university!
