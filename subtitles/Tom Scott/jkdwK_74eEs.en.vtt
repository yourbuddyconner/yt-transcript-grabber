00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.670
 I am here in Europoort, one of the busiest ports in the world, near Rotterdam. 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.570
 There are many amazing infrastructure projects in the area here. There are the Delta Works 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:16.019
 the kilometers and kilometers of moveable and lockable storm surge barrier that ensures that all of it 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:18.830
 land here is not completely flooded when there is a spring tide. 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.140
 But there is a lesser known one, and it is quite amazing. Because this channel is a problem here 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.050
 has. Because this channel may look great for British standards, but that is not the case at all. 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.789
 If you control a large high-sided, flat-sided container ship and you have to 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.940
 between the piles of that bridge there, that is a very difficult task 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.460
 during the best situations. There is also a very difficult curve here, where you have the harbor 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.969
 comes in. That is all very difficult. And it gets made worse by the fact that 

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:50.969
 this is in the Netherlands. It is very flat here and it is very windy. So what do you do? 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.639
 Well, do you see these things behind me? Yes... 

00:00:54.639 --> 00:00:56.659
 They stopped the wind! 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:03.909
 This is the amazing Rozenburg Wind Wall, in the Netherlands. He is 25 meters high at his peak, 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:10.810
 he is huge. And it is 1.6 kilometers long. And it stops the wind on this 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.729
 whole piece of channel 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.509
 Not entirely, but about 75% of it. But enough to make the difference between 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.100
 against the bridge, or go straight under. 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.109
 This is an amazing project. Not only because of its almost incredible scale. 

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:28.620
 I do not think I can show through camera what it is like to be under such a thing 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.710
 but ... this is what you can do if you have millions of goods containers, billions 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.170
 Euros, by a port. You can call two architects, Strujis and de Wit and 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.310
 say: "We have to stop the wind." 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.039
 And we are people: we stop the wind. 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:51.020
 This wind wall is a symbol for what people can do if they want something. And like a big part of it 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.979
 the Delta Works - and everything around here - this is a victory of mankind on nature. And 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:57.899
 it is beautiful.
