00:00:00.267 --> 00:00:03.744
 The European Central Bank wanted to have bridges on its banknotes. 

00:00:03.890 --> 00:00:08.169
 The problem was that the euro used 12 states and the banknotes existed in only 7 values. 

00:00:08.412 --> 00:00:11.232
 They could not be neutral and take one bridge from each country, 

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:14.107
 therefore designer Robert Kalina created fictitious bridges, 

00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:16.003
 which would represent the whole of Europe. 

00:00:16.076 --> 00:00:20.172
 No one could complain that they missed it because the bridges did not exist. 

00:00:20.585 --> 00:00:22.287
 Except... 

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.357
 Welcome to Spijkenisse near Rotterdam. 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.645
 A few years ago, an apartment complex was built on this island 

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.513
 and the designer thought to build these bridges 

00:00:31.611 --> 00:00:33.434
 and to put them all in the Netherlands. 

00:00:33.616 --> 00:00:36.728
 They are exactly the same. They are built in the same style. 

00:00:36.856 --> 00:00:40.405
 Even in the very bright colors that actually look bizarre. 

00:00:40.581 --> 00:00:43.693
 You can also find abstract statues that look nice on paper, 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:45.906
 but in fact they are weird. 

00:00:46.009 --> 00:00:48.513
 The higher the value of the banknote, the more modern the bridge. 

00:00:48.738 --> 00:00:53.843
 If you have a banknote of 500 euros, the bridge looks like this pink ... thing. 

00:00:54.536 --> 00:00:58.329
 The European Central Bank liked this idea and therefore approved it. 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.541
 People like it too. 

00:01:00.717 --> 00:01:02.857
 It has become a small tourist attraction 

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:06.874
 and also the attractions that got on the maps. 

00:01:07.123 --> 00:01:12.374
 How often does anyone build the infrastructure just like a joke? 

00:01:13.092 --> 00:01:20.798
