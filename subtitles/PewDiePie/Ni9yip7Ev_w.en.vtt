00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:02.040
 BEAUTIFUL 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:02.780
 SISTER 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.620
 SURPRIZE !! 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.380
 SERVIS 

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.900
 Skrattar du (You laugh) 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.180
 FÃ¶rlorar du !! (You lose !!) 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.120
 Hey Vsauce * @ #% here. The rule is simple. 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.260
 (Swedish) 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.840
 Will you play my game? Then you have to play after my rules and the rule is simple. 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.380
 It is not allowed to laugh. Let's start the game! 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.159
 Do you know what to do by eating spicy things? 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:55.809
 ME GUSTA 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:59.849
 GUSTA is the best MEME. When it reaches the top of the goal of that point 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.579
 It is as if it reaches the top of the mountain. ME GUSTA MEME 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.268
 KA has been down since then. Foolish (STUPID LIKE A BOSS). When people expose expired memes to me ... 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.240
 What 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.540
 What is that flurry? YES and do it for him? 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.980
 What was that awful. Drunk locks the throat. 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.240
 You break the meme. What is it? What's wrong with you. 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.609
 They should have been replaced by the noise that makes Yoshi. Can we do that? 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.550
 How lovely 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.070
 This is very cool. Is it Final Fantasy? 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.160
 It's very cool 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.269
 Let me find it, I'll fly the drunken camera. 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.680
 We need to find a female rogue 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.809
 It seems to me he found a woman. Am I right ... 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.150
 What the hell is going on there. Forgive me, can I see it again, please? 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:26.510
 Good, good, very good. Oh bears. The hooves are very crazy. What have we got here, orchestration? 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.570
 Someone always posts this 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.849
 Why did someone test this out? In fact what happens if .. 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:12.600
 We will conquer .... 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.600
 It looks like it looks good 

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:07.409
 Of course. 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:20.290
 Okay 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:23.040
 I realized 55 years ago. What happened to a friend? 

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.600
 What happened? 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.779
 I'm expecting a friend. That's why the car is crashing or what? 

00:05:30.779 --> 00:05:32.420
 Yes. I'm waiting for a friend. 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:37.539
 I'm waiting for a friend. He's somewhere there. 

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:44.620
 I do not understand how the car crash happened? What crash? 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:45.830
 It has ruined tires and other things. 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.240
 Well, I am waiting for a friend. Who is your friend? James. 

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:58.930
 Who is James? 

00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:18.340
 Can I see a little patent to please? NO. 

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.800
 I wonder if James came back. 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.370
 NO NO. I did not laugh at it. Close your mouth. Drunk got it! 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:54.530
 What the hell did Larry David do? 

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.579
 How can you laugh like Larry? Are you okay? 

00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:31.460
 Oh great god, stop, quit with incessant meme. They are not to laugh. 

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.640
 They're strange. They're just strange. 

00:07:57.800 --> 00:08:03.280
 Where's my pistol Edgar. Plus 5 points increase my desire to die. 

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.280
 Thanks to Minion. 

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:11.740
 Oh i know what this is .... 

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:20.920
 Have you ever thought about this ... 

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:27.339
 Because it turned out that it is true ... 

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:36.069
 You did not think it would be so easy ... 

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:50.439
 In the full sense of the word why not fade to care less about me 

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:55.299
 .. superhighway movies at this moment. It's just emotion of the moment. 

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.020
 I do not know why people still see them. You did this okay? 

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:05.109
 You did this okay? How much to know you did this okay? You know those rumors that come up and say: 

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.310
 YOU WIN 

00:09:06.310 --> 00:09:11.590
 And you think who is so stupid that you will click it. They exist because people click on them, drunken ... 

00:09:11.930 --> 00:09:15.820
 There are times in the world that make these things happen. The same thing happens with EA 

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.049
 Why do you think there are microtransmissions? I bet you think that ah uhh ehh who drunk the pay for that drunk .. 

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:27.609
 There are people who pay for it. That's why it exists. Idiots ruin everything. I just want a nice Batman movie again. 

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.680
 Ouuu is a snake 

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:34.910
 beautifully 

00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:38.559
 What, though why is the serpent inside Cheerios? 

00:09:39.020 --> 00:09:45.849
 Do not you hate when you're throwing some Cheerios, and the snake is like: Oh my breath of your cheerios 

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:48.880
 What do we have here? 

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:57.220
 You were not known to be a simple person but I wonder ... I actually think I'm a simple person, in fact I'm a simpler person you can understand .. 

00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:00.849
 Yes thank you. That was the talk. 

00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.359
 Speaking of real words to a simple man 

00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:08.240
 Look at his face 

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.260
 He is very happy. It resembles that blazer from the movie The Bee Movie 

00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:17.200
 I do not bother you, do not boss. Tell me I'm wrong. Tell me that I'm a bug now 

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:25.989
 I'm so simple that you can not get a headache, so simple. 

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:43.689
 Yes, that was a nice question. I do the same question every day. 

00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:52.130
 It could be a wall, you know, they're all there. 

00:10:54.630 --> 00:10:59.929
 This was for this week 

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:08.690
 Do you laugh or lose? Be honest, open and share the laughter in the comments 

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:14.599
 You may have understood, the elephant in the room with his cage is gone. I'm bored to give you the news that he changed his life today 

00:11:15.690 --> 00:11:19.729
 I do not know what happened. He just is not with me. 

00:11:20.550 --> 00:11:24.050
 Slipy is not me. I took it as a meme 

00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:28.639
 I took Slipy as a gallant and I did not think I would intend for that stupid frog 

00:11:28.639 --> 00:11:34.219
 But in the end I liked that betkos. I really tried to do the best for her 

00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:41.149
 Although multiple information about frogs is like killing them because they are an infection in Australia 

00:11:41.149 --> 00:11:44.629
 I thought we should close this episode in honor of Slipy 

00:11:44.630 --> 00:11:51.349
 I think he would like this. RIP Slipy. Let's see a Slipy montage on this channel. 

00:11:51.930 --> 00:11:54.829
 Slipy is there .. 

00:12:17.790 --> 00:12:20.610
 Why did I think it was a good idea to get a frog ...
