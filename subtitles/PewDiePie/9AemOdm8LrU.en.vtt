00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.260
 (happy music) 

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.260
 (applause) 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.800
 Amy: "Wow..." 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.900
 "Thank you, thank you very much for being here as part of tonight, that's great! 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.309
 welcome. It’s so cool not only to have a show with four women but also with three best friends. 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.969
 Oh...so, thank you for participating in the show tonight. 

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:34.400
 (applause) 

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:39.520
 People always think that I am superficial because I am really beautiful. 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.520
 (Beep...not funny) 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.520
 (high heels pedaling) 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.020
 But no, I am really not, I am not superficial. Like the guy I see now, it’s not even very good. 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.740
 (Applause and cheerful music begins) 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.300
 Amy Schumer is not funny. 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.060
 I hate Amy Schumer. 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:01.060
 I am Amy Schumer, I like the second child in my ass. 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.060
 XDXDXD 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.520
 (music stop) 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.040
 How come, brother? Is your boy PewDiePie 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.389
 I am a 12-level white knight. 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:25.300
 And I am here to escort Amy Schumer, because all of your alternative right-wing, hateful, white 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:26.990
 Male 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.020
 angry 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.900
 *mouthwash* mouthwash sound 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:37.020
 Amy Schumer is the greatest comedian ever. You don't understand Amy Schumer like I do. 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.040
 You don't understand her comedy. When Amy Schumer said my vagina 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.540
 When Amy Schumer said, "My vagina." 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:46.780
 She doesn't just say my vagina. She is talking more deeply 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.920
 About *Echo*Life 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.660
 (again) *Echo*About life 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:50.520
 Damn it! 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.520
 Amy: "Vagina (plural)" 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.320
 "(again) vagina" 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.940
 "vaginal" 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:54.540
 "vaginal" 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.040
 "vaginal" 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.540
 "vaginal" 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.180
 "vaginal" 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.680
 "vaginal" 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.180
 "vaginal" 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.680
 "vaginal" 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.460
 "vaginal" 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.520
 "As long as you do something in a female comedy, you know "How much fat you are" and "How much do you want to have sex with a man" and say, "Well ~ Vagina," many times. " 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.140
 "vaginal" 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.140
 *With a gasping laughter* 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:11.120
 When Amy Schumer made a series of inconsistent shit and noise? 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.429
 This is the pinnacle of comedy. Don't you understand? 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:17.980
 (Amy Schumer makes a strange sound) 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.660
 "mmmmmmmmmm" 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.540
 "WhoooooWeeeee" 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.720
 "Ajabajajawa" 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.340
 "mm...mm..." 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.180
 If you don't like Amy Schumer, that's because 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.610
 You hate women. 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.600
 I am a sixth grade 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.760
 Because everyone knows "respect for women", so of course this does not apply to me. 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.400
 Visitor: Especially... 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.980
 Amy: Hey... 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.860
 Interviewers: They apologize to you for "This will not be a good speech." 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.400
 Amy: Yes. 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.240
 Interviewer: I want to know what you did. where are we....? How do we get to that place? 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.860
 (Amy) I think, because many people hate women* shawls spit out water* There are so many angers for women... oh... 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.860
 * Pewds enters a cough* 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:55.660
 This is very serious 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.380
 *Inhalation* 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.540
 That's right. If you don't think Amy Schumer is interesting, 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.960
 This is because you hate women. Learn more about yourself. Learn more about your ideas 

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.600
 Think about why? 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.300
 Why don't I laugh at these funny jokes? 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:10.740
 Oh yes... 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.000
 I hate women. 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.840
 *Inconsistent noise* 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:17.900
 Hahaha 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.540
 Hilarious 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.080
 so funny. 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.560
 Sorry, I am just laughing at Amy’s joke. Now I saw Amy Schumer. 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.060
 *The sound of sunglasses is lowered* 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:30.720
 Now I saw Amy Schumer. Maybe I was introduced to her five years ago. 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.800
 Before she really blew up, she was really not as unbearable as it is today. 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.480
 what happened? 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.860
 Let's talk about it. 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.860
 It all started when Amy was accused of stealing jokes. Not just once, but... 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.040
 repeatedly. 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.000
 At least a couple. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.780
 (Dave) Did you lose power when you were drinking? Or I call it time travel. 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.820
 (audience laughs) 

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:55.730
 (David) Yes. 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.590
 (Amy) Has anyone turned black and woke up after they came out? 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.230
 Thank you. Thank you sister 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.680
 That's cool. Because you are a time traveler 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.140
 (Amy) You are like going back to your body. 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:10.140
 Because the ball is disgusting. Are they not? 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.140
 Wow! 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:12.700
 They are stinking. 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.060
 Yes, they do it. 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:19.860
 Ok, I will speak for my ball. On my best day, my ball might smell like a foot. On my best day. 

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:20.980
 (audience laughs) 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.840
 my cat... 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.849
 odor... 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.610
 Like a little... 

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:29.660
稗 animals. 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:30.620
 Ok? 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.460
 Hahaha 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:37.960
 Do you want to hear jokes that other comedians tell in a less interesting way? 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:40.540
 Just look at each of Amy Schumer (laughing your own jokes) 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:47.220
 Um... * 5 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:48.640
 (laugh) 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.240
 These examples are too numerous to mention, and there are actually dozens of examples. I don't want to continue to exist... 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:55.990
 Repeat myself. you understood 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:03.600
 However, snickering is just the worst thing you can do. I can even understand the thinking process. 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.840
 That will steal someone’s thoughts by sinking into the low point. 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:16.720
 They work hard, they spend their souls and passions on things that are deprived of others. 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:17.870
 Not so interesting 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:19.610
 How can you do this? 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.610
 How can someone sink to such a low level? 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:28.569
 Anyway, have you seen my latest LWIAY feature show and see if you think you will like it. Amy has to brush 

00:05:28.569 --> 00:05:33.600
 Blame these things by saying "No, I didn't steal a joke." 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:39.320
 Although there is evidence that I have seen these comedy specials. 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:43.260
 Maybe she didn't do it on purpose. I do not know. I really don't care. 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:44.500
 (hiccup) 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:51.840
 But this is exactly what Amy's giant self-declined spiral or rising spiral. 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.620
 When her Netflix was launched, 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:57.320
 This is the most interesting thing released so far. 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:59.320
 I literally died. 

00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:00.500
 Then come back 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:02.300
 Look at it 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.719
 Or at least I hope I am dead, I saw the whole thing. 

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.420
 I am not kidding, I have seen some shit. 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.140
 But if you don't see it, here is a summary. 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:13.000
 Pussy pussy pussy pussy pussy 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.039
 Pussy cat pussy pussy pussy 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:22.579
 It got too many votes in favor, it literally has a star rating on Netflix 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:28.729
 Remember Netflix's previous ratings, which is very useful for understanding what you can watch. 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:30.860
 Other recommendations 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:37.840
 Ok, they told us about it, because Amy Schumer’s Netflix special rating is too low, so it’s too much 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.640
 So why does Amy’s special evaluation of her so low that she basically blames her opponents for her responsibilities? 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:47.340
 Is this the correct reason? 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.240
 My comedy is not doing well. 

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.240
 This is not because I am not funny. 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:53.460
 This is because... 

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:55.460
 She is spinning the wheel at home 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.340
 Ding Ding Ding Ding. This is because this very right political group 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:05.380
 Of course I don't like me 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:08.179
 Amy, hello. If you are watching, 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.300
 You have a big self problem, now is the time for you to deal with it, and I am atatatata 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.829
 Yes, I know you just want to brush it off, then call me, or something similar. 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:26.179
 But I think this will really help you admit that there is something wrong with it. It will be great 

00:07:26.760 --> 00:07:27.810
 just 

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:29.550
 take the first step 

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:35.120
 Please because you will be more and more disappointed when you face criticism 

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:42.710
 Accept it or disapprove or you can say no because you hate women or women 

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:51.230
 Because you belong to this political group. This is a problem. Many celebrities with a lot of self will face such problems in the face of criticism. 

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:57.829
 This is always the fault of others. It will never be their own and cause them to be just crazy. 

00:07:58.140 --> 00:08:01.610
 They understand this theory as why they... 

00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:08.840
 ...you face criticism, which is why they just lost it. Amy, you have lost it. It’s beautiful... come on! 

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:14.540
 I think the reason I am so annoyed with Amy is that she is hiding behind this flag. 

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.269
 Social justice, she is such a great person. 

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.279
 You know, but she is no problem like everyone else. 

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:25.790
 By the way, but she has a person, if someone calls her fat, 

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.549
 This is a huge deal, and you are ashamed. 

00:08:28.650 --> 00:08:31.880
 But she literally bought a shameful person because she was too thin. 

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:39.379
 Recently, Amy wants to get the same rewards as her male comedians, such as David Sharp and Chris Rock. 

00:08:40.110 --> 00:08:43.939
 Apparently, she only paid half of her Netflix. Oh boohoo. 

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.650
 I think this is a lot done in the entertainment field of people. 

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:55.009
 Male and female, and said, "Oh, this person has done so much, this person they have done so much 

00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:59.089
 Why don't they earn the same salary? Are they all women? " 

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:03.709
 Just because they are different genders. That's why they didn't make the same amount 

00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:08.149
 No, this is because people don't like your show, Amy. People don't like your special. 

00:09:08.950 --> 00:09:13.209
 Dave Chapell is especially one of the best comedies of the year, 

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:20.709
 Unlike yours, it failed. You must understand that this is not a gender issue. But of course, this is why. 

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:26.500
 Because it will never be you Amy. Is this always someone else is not? 

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:30.670
 My understanding is that if Trump wins. just 

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.990
 It is crazy. 

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:39.940
 If November is not Hillary, does your behavior change? Has your outlook changed? My actual change is because I need to learn to speak Spanish. 

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:43.000
 Because I will move to Spain or somewhere. 

00:09:43.699 --> 00:09:45.381
 Amy, have you heard of Saudi Arabia? 

00:09:45.381 --> 00:09:49.119
 (Editor shows the Swedish flag) I think you will like it, there is no Trump. 

00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:53.500
 Please leave. Sincerely, everyone. I am having a good time now. 

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:58.500
 (Amy's show) So I think that as the show continues, I will start to look more and more like a snowman. 

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:03.240
 (Laughter from the crowd), it feels like a lot... 

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.240
 (The guy in the background) Tell us your nipples! 

00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:10.440
 Ok, wait a minute. The man who said "Show us your nipples" came here. 

00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:12.440
 This is... great. 

00:10:12.440 --> 00:10:14.400
 Come out. Everyone points to him, 

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:15.900
 So I know which one. 

00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:17.940
 You are a typical Swede 

00:10:18.839 --> 00:10:25.099
 Look at them. This is the thing. If someone is ridiculed, you should make them fools by joking. 

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:30.300
 Ok, you are wearing a shirt that says "I...what?" 

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:34.120
 What does it say? (pewds)ohhhhh,sh * t 

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.720
 ...you can't speak English. You just shouted: "Let's see your nipples." 

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:44.320
 Don't be shy now. what do you do for a living? 

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.060
 (background) sales. (Amy repeats) sales... 

00:10:49.060 --> 00:10:51.060
 How is this solved? 

00:10:51.060 --> 00:10:53.060
 (Applause) 

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:58.120
 This is not a joke. This is not a joke. 

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:03.100
 (pewds laugh) 

00:11:03.899 --> 00:11:06.859
 She can't make a joke on the spot. 

00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:15.560
 What, you just yelled again? Oh, sorry. Yes, now is the time. Goodbye. 

00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:17.560
 (pewds) And he just got kicked out! 

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:22.800
 My God, f ** King Swede. 

00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.000
 The Bud Light Party is here to discuss equal pay for equal work. 

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.300
 It is wrong for women not to be paid like men. 

00:11:27.300 --> 00:11:29.000
 We must pay more for the same thing. 

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:29.500
 what? ! 

00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:30.600
 Yes, the car. 

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.100
 what! 

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.000
 Dry cleaning. 

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:32.800
 what? 

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:38.700
 shampoo. what? You pay more, but you earn less? This is a double mistake. I called everyone I know. 

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:40.000
 what are you saying? 

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000
 That is wrong. 

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.700
 We must pay more for the same thing. what? 

00:11:43.348 --> 00:11:45.750
 No, you don't. You don't have to pay more. 

00:11:45.970 --> 00:11:53.000
 Why are you lying? Imagine the effort to fight for women’s sports by getting paid for the promotion of beer. 

00:11:53.649 --> 00:11:55.649
 Then just squirt a bunch of lies. 

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:00.900
 Bud Light is proud to support equal pay for equal work. That's why Bud Light costs the same, whether you are a guy or a lady. 

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:02.000
 are you kidding me? 

00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:03.200
 what! 

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.690
 Oh, I never thought about that... that. By the way, have I told you about my chair? This is 399! 

00:12:07.690 --> 00:12:09.690
 I know! What a good price! 

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:15.330
 If you are a boy and a girl, you might think that the cost is the same. 

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:21.270
 excuse me. We are not so progressive liberals, Amy Schumer 

00:12:23.380 --> 00:12:25.380
 If you are a woman... (whamen) 

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.940
 Get this! This chair costs 399... 

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:38.130
 Point zero. You are welcome, women across the country. Thanks to the brave people like Amy Schumer. 

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:45.089
 Already possible, possible. By the way, she got paid, just let you know and let you know. 

00:12:45.089 --> 00:12:49.769
 But to be honest, you call yourself a comedian, but you don't do that much. Just like I go fishing a few times a year, 

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.500
 But I will not introduce myself to a fisherman on TV. Wow. 

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:54.500
 Oof ow 

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:59.250
 So that means only because I used to be a blind man, I am not a blind man? 

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:04.140
 Thank you, Amy Schumer, that means a lot. Basically the two are talking about 

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:10.469
 When you have sex for the first time in a relationship, he said he should wait a little longer. 

00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:11.820
 She is very good 

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.379
 It doesn't matter, you should have sex right away, and she is very confident in this life. 

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:18.680
 I am older than you, but you are stupid. 

00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:20.980
 I must say my last 3 relationships 

00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:27.040
 Each of them lasts two to five years, and we insist on each other almost immediately, because I 

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:29.600
 Know that I want to be with them. You understand 

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:32.760
 In addition to the five-year mark 

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.320
 A good example for a persistent relationship 

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:44.029
 Man, I think my favorite Amy Schumer clip is probably the most interesting thing. 

00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:51.680
 What she has done is that she stole a joke from Ellen DeGeneres. 

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.680
 Then tell it 

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:59.479
 Ellen DeGeneres, this is definitely great. Let's see it. I look like I am feeding, and I am eating popcorn. 

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.880
 I think we all eat popcorn. 

00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:06.469
 The first time you know that you always start to feel a little like lying to yourself? 

00:14:11.279 --> 00:14:16.189
 Only one you know at a time, then just like you become more real 

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:17.850
 Correct 

00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.990
 Then eventually you are just like you are real, and it's just a gimmick! 

00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:28.459
 And about the dark things, we lost all the taboos in the dark, that is, popcorn is really delicious. 

00:14:28.459 --> 00:14:30.649
 We have to shovel a small part of it into our mouth 

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.650
 Do you eat popcorn? 

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:42.320
 Are you a popcorn fan? 

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.020
 When she grew up, whenever Amy Schumer said she wanted to be a comedian, everyone laughed. 

00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.050
 No one is laughing now 

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:55.600
 If you look at it, this is Amy Amy for me. 

00:14:55.600 --> 00:15:00.939
 I hope you like it, please leave your approval and as always 

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.700
 My vagina 

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:05.700
 (cough) 

00:15:09.620 --> 00:15:11.620
 Heh brofist! 

00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:12.300
 Pooh! 

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.300
 EHH. (See you guys)
