00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.640
 In 2003 the Human Genome Project completed a monumental scientific achievement: 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:09.460
 the first complete map of the human genome. 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.059
 A few decades later you can now do a genetic test ... 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.930
 by spitting into a tube and paying a few hundred dollars. 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.830
 But I'm not here for that. 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.050
 This is CUBRIC, one of the most advanced brain sciences in Europe, 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:30.900
 and they do not scan the human genome here, they scan connectomes. 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.280
 The term "connectome" was invented a few years ago ... 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.120
 as a name for the simultaneous mapping of all brain connections at the same time. 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.210
 These connections are formed by what is called the "white matter" in the brain. 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.880
 We know that the brain has gray matter. 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.239
 However, it also has white matter, and that is the wiring between them. 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:50.260
 We are also very interested in the so-called microstructures, 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.760
 differentiating based on the size and shape of cells ... 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.580
 which may only be one thousandth of a millimeter in size. 

00:00:56.589 --> 00:00:58.249
 This scanner will enable us ... 

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:01.589
 to get information about differences within the entire brain ... 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:04.600
 in a way that was only posthumously possible in the past. 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.740
 I would have preferred to have myself scanned, but unfortunately ... 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.680
 I have a little too much metal in my body. 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.070
 Do not worry about me or the camera being sucked in here, 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.860
 this is just the simulator they train on. 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.050
 There are no magnets at all here. 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.990
 The real scanner is there. 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.590
 The magnetic field of this MRI scanner allows us ... 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.250
 to observe the movement of water molecules ... 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.210
 over a distance of about a thousandth of a millimeter. 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.210
 To map someone's complete connectome, 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.130
 we must first acquire the raw data, 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.210
 then we have to adapt it to calculation models, 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.330
 and then we have to reconstruct these trajectories. 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.020
 This way we quickly go from a few hundred megabytes ... 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.800
 up to dozens of gigabytes. 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.930
 Hopeful science fiction fans should not be too enthusiastic: 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.990
 just as you can not make a copy of a person by copying their genome ... 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.150
 but only an identical twin baby who does not know anything, 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.750
 scanning a connectome does not mean that you can suddenly upload someone into a computer. 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.720
 Scanners like this generate road maps, no satellite photos. 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.900
 An impressive road map, though. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.060
 We are far from capable of identifying differences in personality at this time, 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.119
 but that does not mean that we can not do this in the future. 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.129
 People are generally wired in the same way, 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.680
 but the subtle differences in the forms of the routes ... 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.069
 seem to be very reproducible. 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.650
 When we scan 300 people, and then scan one of them again, 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.660
 we can easily identify them from those 300 people. 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.800
 In fact, any neurological or psychiatric illness you can think of ... 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.540
 a symptom of poor brain function. 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.360
 And we know that brain function is based on information transfer from region to region. 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.140
 We can say things like "there is something else in the integrity of the white matter". 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:45.280
 For all kinds of neurological or psychiatric diseases, the information from this scanner ... 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.819
 be very valuable and give us important new insights. 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:50.060
 And if we can bring down the cost of the technology, 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.739
 can you have a connectoom scan made ... 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.200
 and receive customized treatment for your specific connectomic abnormality. 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.290
 At this moment, connectome scans are cumbersome and expensive, 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.430
 and a lot of time is needed to process and visualize them. 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.189
 But only 20 years ago that applied to genome scans. 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:12.720
 Within twenty years, connectome research could mean just as much for the world. 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.180
 Many thanks to everyone at CUBRIC, at the University of Cardiff. 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.040
 If you want to know more, they have a YouTube channel that you can explore, 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.480
 and there is a link in the description.
