 Lyrics videos can be found all over YouTube. Record companies like it for a good reason: 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.820
 They are cheap, compared to a full video. They can be distributed earlier which means 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.000
 that there is more than a static image for the many who only listen to music through 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.980
 YouTube. They also separate the release of the official release of the unofficial fan videos 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.640
 undisturbed pop up. 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.180
 Lyrics videos are older than that, however. There is a debate about Bob Dylan's 1965 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.349
 Subterranean Homesick Blues, which possibly counts. 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.430
 Perhaps the video of Prince's "Sign O 'The Times" (1987) was the first songtext video ever. 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.140
 Just moving shapes and words, complete with somewhat questionable spelling and punctuation 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.120
 that you will encounter today on such an amateur video. 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.840
 And in 1990 George Michael's "Praying for Time" was simply white text on a black one 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.930
 background. That was about ten years before, where it would fit exactly between the movies 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.120
 made in Windows Movie Maker. 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:59.750
 You can trace the modern, professional lyric video back to kinetic or dynamic typography. 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.920
 Inspired by, among other things, Saul Bass films. There was a trend on YouTube 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.670
 to extract various scenes from films and to enter into dialogue. Jarratt Moody 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.280
 dynamic "Pulp Fiction" scene is an example of this. 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:18.290
 This led to a trend that lasted until 2010 - culminating in a devastating video 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:24.200
 about Jonathan Coulton are Shop Vac, uploaded in November 2010. But then it was 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.450
 Katy Perry d'r management already started with simple lyrics - subtitles and a photo in the background. 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.850
 They had to compete against those of the fans, who had been making unofficial versions for years. 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.380
 These unofficial videos often had wrong or badly spelled lyrics, and in some cases 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.610
 the music was slightly noticed or delayed 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.030
 Dodge YouTube's Copyright System. 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.030
 It was Cee-Lo Green in 2010 that was the first mainstream, dynamic and hugely popular songtext video 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.460
 from the song 'Forget You'. Out of nothing everyone had 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.229
 need to have one too. 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.670
 Some were ingeniously designed and brought the art of moving graphics 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.420
 back in the mainstream. Some ... were bad. But as long as YouTube continues to exist: 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.950
 Well, they will stay.
