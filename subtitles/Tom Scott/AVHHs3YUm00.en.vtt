00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320
 This is the Thames, the river that flows through London. 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.060
 In the 19th, the Thames stank 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:06.740
 Literally. 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:10.660
 The flush toilet was invented, but the sewerage not yet 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.840
 which meant that all the afal was immediately flushed into the Thames. 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.360
 To make things worse, the Thames also has tides 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:18.680
 So it did not always go directly to the sea 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.120
 Sometimes it came back 

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.620
 Actually, it is more wrapped up 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:23.800
 because salt water is heavier 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.600
 so it went kind of .... 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:26.540
 does not matter 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.080
 what does matter is that Joseph Bagel 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.480
 Joseph Bazalgette! 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.080
 I keep blessing "Bagelgette" 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.340
 a fantastic Victorian engineer with a huge, ridiculous mustache 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.020
 built the largest riol system 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.700
 that now the most waste flushes away 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.120
 Included, here under "The Embankment" 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.860
 But that was built for a 19th century London 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.320
 and has not changed in the 20th 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.560
 And now this is such a big city 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.760
 that there is not enough capacity 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.320
 So here is something that you may not have known 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.320
 In the Themes until today 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.020
 sometimes unfiltered waste water muzzled. 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.660
 After a big rain storm, when it has rained for days to one 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.360
 and there is just too much water to filter out. 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.600
 They pump it in the Thames 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.440
 And that is something you may not have known. 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.480
 That the Thames still has some stench from the 19th 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.820
