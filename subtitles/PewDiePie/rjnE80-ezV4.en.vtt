 This film is sponsored by Elyland 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.000
 Say hello to the best gamers in the world. 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.120
 No flaws 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.820
 It’s me, I’m coming back, baby, come play video games. 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:16.800
 You thought that I didn't play video games because I was too playful. 

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.660
 Yes, cry, you should thank me for not playing games. 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.300
 Because I will blow your ass, your mother's ass, and your dad's ass (?) 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.880
 And now, I am going to marry you in Wormax.io. 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.800
 You may be familiar with this game. 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.520
 He has many similarities with all games. 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.520
 But it has a lot of new features. 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.300
 Like a task, 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.980
 Different abilities, games, 3 kinds of skills, accelerators, you can also play multiplayer games with friends. 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.660
 Grade and multiple props 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.020
 The best part is 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.300
 You can also choose the style 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.300
 That should be me. 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.120
 Yay 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.040
 Hey, it has a brother boxing 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.860
 I don't think this is me, but it is so cute, so I have to choose it. 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.380
 I mean I am the best player. 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.620
 I have to take over the world, Bros. 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.160
 Yeah, now I have this, how can I accelerate it? 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.940
 Then I unlocked new skills 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.980
 We have to change to the first place. 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.040
 I won’t stop until the pewdiepie leap forward. 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.220
 First place, go to the first place 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.740
 Dry, I just lost what happened, everything happened. 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.920
 Oh my haha 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.900
 No, not good, so now we have two new skills. 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.019
 I can't stop, I have to guess which is useful, but now is not the time. 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.160
 E should let me pass other people 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.440
 Suck that, little penguin 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.440
 Sorry, I take this game too seriously. 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.580
 I am killing me and killing this game. 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.460
 I was born to play this game, I am this game. 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.060
 I am here to be important and not to be able to be respected with a gun. 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.620
 Don't block my way, don't block my way. 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.400
 Let's die, yes, I have no pity. 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.400
 Oh, another one. 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.040
 49, we have to be the first 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.340
 Pewdiepie does not play games 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.260
 That's because I am too playful. 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.460
 I will play to the north. 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.100
 I was born... stop you, fucking 屎

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.880
 It doesn't matter, that's the second inconvenience. 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.440
 We will go back to the top, we can also play that game 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.280
 Suck my snake and suck it down 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.020
 Hey, wait for that guy to use mine. 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.540
 Oh, that’s not me, but it’s casual. 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.100
 a little frustration 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.060
 Don't worry, we have to be the first 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.440
 No matter how 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.780
 Good, there are also items in this game. 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.440
 Look at that yeah 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.500
 Can I get one more? Please. 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.620
 Honestly, this is a bit difficult 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.760
 I need to start using skills. 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.760
 I think that is the problem. 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:18.260
 Hey, you are out of this way. 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.860
 I am sorry, you just made three small 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.340
 Oh no, you can't play it. 

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.740
 How? 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.120
 And I respect women #$% people 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:32.780
 Don't you try to engage me. 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.760
 The best gamer in the world 

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.000
 Look around and see the swing 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.080
 What did he do? What is it? 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.660
 Oh, you are not trapped. 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.800

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.780
 No, please. 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.780
 Really miserable 

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.200
 Oh, he is not trapped, is it not? 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.540
 I don’t see you, you can’t be like that. 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.140
 Why don’t you stop? 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.640

 Only one belief makes me come back 

00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:28.360
 Just to be the first 

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:31.360
