00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.629
 For a few hours in May 2016, for the first time in more than a century, 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:08.240
 Britain did not burn any coal in the production of electricity. 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.320
 None at all. 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.240
 All coal-fired power plants were disconnected. 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.860
 And this is one of the reasons. 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.450
 Welcome to the wind farm in Griffin, Scotland. 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.200
 68 turbines with a total capacity of more than 150 megawatts. 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.820
 And these turbines rotate in real time and set the leaves to the wind. 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.140
 With full performance, this farm can feed all cities. 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.960
 But as the world is inclined to renewable energy, 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.859
 we have a little problem. 

00:00:36.859 --> 00:00:42.219
 Since coal, oil, gas and nuclear power plants are basically just giant boilers. 

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:45.090
 They take water, they heat it, it turns into a couple, 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.109
 steam is driven through a huge turbine that rotates and generates current. 

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:51.739
 When I say "turbine", I do not mean such sheets. 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.829
 I mean hundreds of tons of steel rotating at several thousand revolutions per second. 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:59.520
 And all these turbines across the power grid 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.030
 rotating synchronously. 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.970
 After transduction, they have all 50 revolutions per second. 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.430
 In America 60. 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.750
 All in perfect harmony: One slows down, all slow down. 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.030
 One will speed up, all will accelerate. 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.560
 And this prevents the blinking of your bulbs permanently. 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.230
 Because the power supply must always be almost exactly the same as the power consumption. 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.590
 There is not a large enough battery for national electricity storage. 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.720
 So if the power plant is suddenly disconnected from the system, 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.980
 where will the electricity be taken from? 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.040
 The response is the kinetic energy of those turbines 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.010
 those thousands of tons of steel rotating all over the country. 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.710
 Households and factories literally vacuum the turbine's kinetic energy 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.291
 to overcome the decline, thereby slowing it down. 

00:01:45.291 --> 00:01:48.100
 But it will not be a problem for some 60 seconds 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.410
 and during that time the State Bureau of Network Administration, what I know, 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.180
 the next fuel rod grips the grill 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.320
 and will increase the performance of other power plants. This will cover consumption. 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.860
 But it depends on the amount of rotating matter 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.240
 or insufficient inertia of the system. 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.630
 And on this turbine? 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.630
 You see for yourself. 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.899
 No thousand tons of rotating steel 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.459
 just a few sheets, a little metal 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.680
 and a few circuits that send the electricity to the grid at the right frequency. 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.739
 If the whole system was driven only by the wind and the sun 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.719
 it would have no rotating matter. No system stability. 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.030
 As soon as the supply and consumption were dismantled, the circuit breakers would fail, 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.950
 and everything would collapse. 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.269
 There are possible solutions. 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:33.260
 The pumping power stations are here some Friday, 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.849
 these are the two lakes at different heights. 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:37.769
 With excess electricity, the water is pumped up 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.159
 and if shorted it is sent down through the generators. 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:43.680
 But it takes seconds to minutes. 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.420
 It is also being experimented, for example, with molten glass containers, 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.909
 compressed air and flywheels 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.519
 but so far all are experimental and not very effective. 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.889
 The real solution may come from something unexpected. 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.780
 Because yes, the wind replaces coal and diesel, 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.890
 but it also replaces the gasoline that you can refuel in. 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.599
 And as more and more electric cars connect to the system, 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:13.769
 there will be a lot of relatively large computer batteries. 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.049
 Your car could sell your electricity back to the system in real time 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:19.989
 second after a second, as needed. 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:23.470
 Add smart appliances and gauges to system supervision, 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.680
 find out when to turn on the air conditioning and fridge 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.279
 and there is a system that is largely counterbalanced by itself. 

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:32.799
 Yes, there is still a need for a turbine, 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.560
 some large mass of rotating steel to offset small instantaneous outages, 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.340
 but the solution to balancing the power grid is not as we imagined 20 years ago. 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.189
 They are not large, monolithic batteries. 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:47.409
 There are millions of small ones all over the country. 

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:50.049
 Many thanks to all of the SSE team, 

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:53.769
 who helped me with the team on this wind turbine. 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.109
 I am incredibly grateful. 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:57.290
 They helped us beyond the scope of our duties, so please, 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.029
 look at the links in the description for more info 

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:01.689
 about them and the Griffin wind farm.
