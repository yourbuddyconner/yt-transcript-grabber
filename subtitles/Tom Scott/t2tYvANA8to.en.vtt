00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.960
 ... there is a big day in Westminster 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.840
 It is Prinsjesdag in London, 27 April. 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.840
 And today I have one mission: 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:16.940
 to get as many news items as possible in the background. 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.500
 Camera crews swarm through the capital. 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.560
 I have a public transport chip card, a map of London ... 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.560
 ... there is only one problem. 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.440
 However, I do not need a public transport card. 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.440
 Because I have this: the Mattmobile. 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.720
 It is 10 o'clock, the game has begun. 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.720
 And we're ... stuck in traffic a bit. 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.720
 300 kilometers away, a trained team of researchers watched the TV ... 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.900
 ... to tell us where the cameras were. 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.140
 How are you doing? - Well. 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.800
 Okay, I hardly hear you. Where should I go? 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.420
 Head towards Westminster. - Okay, Westminster. 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.840
 They are there with a camera crew to interview parliamentarians. 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.000
 Attending MEPs. The lawn in front of the parliament. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.760
 Okay, thanks Toni, day! Thank you! Here we go. 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.000
 Tom will now go to the center with the metro. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
 He probably runs into us. 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.680
 But we just heard about the command center ... 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.680
 ... that one of the metro lines does not drive. 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.840
 "Because of a strike, the Victoria line is blocked in both directions." 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.620
 Fantastic. The Victoria line ceases. 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.620
 How can a single metro line stop? 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.440
 Those windows look like gray panels from the outside, right? 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.380
 I had a plan that consisted of getting my head behind Philip Schofield. 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.620
 Yes. There's a lamp post next to that circular thing, right? 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.520
 When I climb on it I have to be able to get into the picture. 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.380
 Somewhere here is that lawn where they always interview politicians. 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:49.180
 Meanwhile, Matt Gray is stuck in traffic somewhere in London. 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.200
 The magic of London is its infrastructure, which still dates from the Middle Ages. 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.100
 This is just a statue with groups of traffic lights around it ... 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.900
 ... and you just have to gamble. 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.340
 I wish I had my public transport card with me. 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.740
 "The next station is Westminster." 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:16.040
 Hello how are you? - Well, we drive towards the Blackfriars Bridge. 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.520
 A few roads that we wanted to take were closed. 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.240
 Right, maybe it's better to do something else ... 

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.240
 ... and find a place to park your car ... 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:27.160
 ... and go to Downing Street. - The command center was right. 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.760
 While I was parking, Tom was already at Westminster. 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.600
 Although he might not have been able to run through the subway station with a backpack. 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.600
 I had something to make up for. 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.960
 Hello, a very good morning. 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:43.240
 Of course we have the latest news about the budget. In the coming minutes (...) 

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.300
 It was an outright race, but I had miles ahead. 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.300
 And I did not run like a girl. 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.940
 There it is. There it is! 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:54.220
 They are. They must be. 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.520
 They are now live on both channels from Westminster. 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:02.060
 Okay, what can you see? Do you see the policeman and the street? 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.640
 I am now behind the BBC tent. 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.920
 Behind the BBC? Stay there, because they come back there after the movie. 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.780
 Here? - They went to someone else again. 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.300
 You have to stand at a lamppost. 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.860
 You are in the picture, you are now in the picture. To wave! 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:25.660
 That is him. - Yes, 20 points! 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.300
 20 points, on to Sky News. 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.300
 I had bitten it off, and I called Matt ... 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.300
 especially to make him jealous. 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.300
 Hi Tom. - 20 points. 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:39.080
 20? Oh no. - I was shown dancing at BBC News. 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.280
 So that's 20 points. - Okay, I have to go. I must hurry ... 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.060
 ... because I am too far away. See you later! 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:47.060
 See you soon, bye! 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.760
 I arrived a little later, but not before Tom had tried in vain for ten minutes ... 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.560
 ... to find out what the Sky cameras were focused on. 

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.380
 I will not come on. They are starting to learn it. 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.380
 They have moved their cameras, so they look up at people ... 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.860
 ... to Parliament instead of the street. This is going to require a creative solution. 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.140
 Nice glasses. 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.980
 We are going to look at Downing Street, I'll see you later. 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.500
 Okay, okay. - See you later! 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:13.640
 The BBC had a camera aimed at the prime minister's door. 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.640
 He had to come out once, and then drive Downing Street. 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:21.280
 I can not come there. The press does: there are a lot of cameras ... 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:26.400
 ... at numbers 10 and 11. And also a van of a cleaning company. 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.200
 I assume that these are indeed cleaners ... 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.420
 ... and not some secret service. 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:33.420
 And now we have to wait. 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.420
 From Liverpool, back to you. 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:37.420
 That was Declan Curry in Liverpool. 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.760
 In this program we like to hear what you think. 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.320
 I do not think they wanted to hear from us. 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.660
 Our editor politician, Adam Boulton, is with them in Westminster. Adam. 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.420
 Yes, Dermot, you can follow me on Twitter and so ... 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:51.420
 ... I have no idea how it works, but apparently. 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.480
 We just see the fences, at the very bottom of the picture. 

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.480
 And the police, on their side of the road. 

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:03.100
 You have to stand between the bald guy and the one with brown hair. 

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:05.780
 Eh, no, that camera position has changed again. 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:08.500
 This is Sky, who can not even keep their cameras still. 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.940
 Look Adam, I'm also on Twitter, and I have to go back to tweet questions from the Prime Minister. 

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.040
 We are modern. 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.520
 We can probably see you, but you can not do anything strange. 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:18.520
 You only get four seconds. 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.620
 What Tom did not succeed in ten minutes, I succeeded in two minutes through pure luck. 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.080
 Unfortunately, I did not notice. 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.180
 And while Tom was waiting, I also took the BBC with me. 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:37.940
 ... to tell us what their expectation is. Jon. 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.240
 Yes, it is a happy event that we are not here to tremble on this lawn. 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.960
 Ooh! Hey. The command center is calling again. Hey? 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.000
 They are live. You really have plenty of places to go to. 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:56.160
 Let me remind you how important the economic background of the budget is. 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.460
 They are now going to a movie. Find a place where you can see the camera ... 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.760
 ... and then you should come into the picture once. 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:08.880
 Yes. Let's stop talking to save battery for both of us. 

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:12.100
 Here, outside Westminster ... - There he is! 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.220
 There, he is in the picture. 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.060
 Do something stupid, Matt. I just hung up. 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:21.240
 Do something stupid, you idiot! 

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:29.540
 Yes! Now! 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.440
 Good! 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.620
 Well done Matt, that's 20 points. 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.580
 Hello Matt. - Hi Tom. Well, how are you doing? 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.600
 Have you earned any points? - No, nothing happens here in Downing Street. 

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:53.380
 We thought that someone would make pictures with a ladder, but that was not the case. 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:55.380
 You are at 20 points. - Yes. 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.300
 I now stand at 30 points, confirmed. - Oh no! 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.720
 During a BBC interview with Iain Duncan Smith, I danced the YMCA. 

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.040
 Okay, see you later Matt. - See you, Tom. Good luck. 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.000
 Good luck. Bye. 

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.060
 I am going to win. 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.640
 And then it got worse. The prime minister took a different route. 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:22.860
 For the people who are now confused about the geography of what we look at ... 

00:07:22.860 --> 00:07:24.200
 he did not go to Whitehall. 

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.080
 He drove under the arch of Foreign Affairs. 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.380
 They follow a very strange route. 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.340
 They are going to the banks of the Thames, I would guess. 

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:36.140
 They're going through the back entrance ... - I did not get any more points. 

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:38.140
 I went back to parliament and discussed with Matt. 

00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:42.380
 You can get 10 extra points by doing something crazy at Sky News. 

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:45.280
 Yes. - And I can still get 20 points ... 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.240
 ... which would equalize the score. I think we're in the wrong place. 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:52.120
 Yes. We can best go back there, I think? 

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:57.480
 Then the prime minister went to explain the budget, and the camera crews outside had a break ... 

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.420
 so we did the only thing we could do: look at it. 

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:06.020
 The prime minister expects the economy to shrink by 3.5% that year. 

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.360
 That is much worse than previously predicted. 

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.300
 Matt and his balls gave me an idea. 

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.780
 Can I borrow those balls? 

00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:21.240
 What are you going to do? In the picture of the cameras juggle? 

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.000
 I want to do that! 

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.980
 Politically, it might be interesting how David Cameron ... 

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.400
 ... as I had predicted ... - Not fair! Not fair! 

00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:33.260
 It was a courageous attempt, but the security of Sky News ... 

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:36.260
 managed to stop us soon. 

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.640
 The problem is that Sky News has the cameras too high. 

00:08:40.640 --> 00:08:42.980
 Way too high. - That's not going to work. 

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.500
 We should climb. 

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.960
 Then I realized that the solution was right in front of me. 

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:50.360
 Abingdon Street. 

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:57.500
 I have the plan B to get to London's local BBC news tonight. 

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:02.000
 Hopefully the command center can find a news report from London. 

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.380
 They could. The first metro strike under Mayor Boris Johnson 

00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:11.600
 It was amazing. And it was in that one place where Tom could not even get his public transport card: ... 

00:09:11.600 --> 00:09:13.600
 ... the Victoria line. On to the Mattmobile. 

00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.100
 No one is filming there. - And while Matt was driving ... 

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:24.440
 I did the only thing I could do. Round and round and around. 

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:28.900
 Traffic was disastrous, even for London. Especially for London. 

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.440
 Then Tom heard something from the command center. 

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:35.420
 In parliament? The BBC are now - moment - I'm going to pick up that bus. 

00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.420
 The BBC had placed a camera in the lobby of the parliament ... 

00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.860
 which is actually open to the public. 

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.720
 So I should go in there, and do that ... okay, okay. 

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.720
 I can try that. 

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.720
 So I had to make a decision. 

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.960
 Stay in the bus, which probably would never work ... 

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.420
 ... or go to parliament, where I probably would not even come in. 

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:57.300
 But just then it appeared that I did not have to choose. 

00:09:57.300 --> 00:09:59.020
 Here we go - right now. 

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:00.380
 I'll come by later. 

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:03.840
 Sky News - wait a minute, this might well succeed. 

00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.840
 Okay, there we go, the bus is passing by. 

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:08.680
 Ehm, from the left, right to the left. 

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.140
 And to make it even more fun, the BBC was also live. 

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.420
 That must have been successful. Yes! 

00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:38.680
 Time was running, and our deadline was close. 

00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.140
 Matt had been stuck in traffic jams for hours. 

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:46.120
 I was waiting in a queue, in the full sun. 

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:49.200
 A reporter forgot to say something. 

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:54.660
 BBC cameras went to the Victoria line while the command center tried desperately ... 

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:56.660
 to find a route for Matt. 

00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.080
 Could one of us score some extra points? 

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.200
 Yes, I could. 

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.480
 You can not see here that three policemen and two security people ... 

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.480
 were ready to arrest me if I was doing weird ... 

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:14.680
 ... so I could only salute to the camera. But it counted anyway. 

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:25.080
 And it was time. We finally met at a parking lot on the south bank of the Thames. 

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.480
 Long day. - It was a very long day. 

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:32.840
 You won, did not you? - I won. Sorry, Matt. 

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:39.160
 More evidence that you can not drive in London. 

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:43.440
 On to the cafe.
