00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.179
 This is the control room for SET (JET) - 

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:06.049
 Joint European Toroid at Culham's Fusion Energy Center. 

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:07.899
 SET is a nuclear fusion experiment, 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:10.680
 a scientific research facility that we hope to do 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.400
 the first step on the way to a hearty and pure fusion energy. 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.710
 When it is in operation, the interior of the reactor is literally 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.060
 the warmest place in the solar system with temperatures 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.420
 about ten times warmer than the sun's core. 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.820
 Within a few minutes there will be another experiment 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.930
 or as they call it here: pulse. 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.309
 We are currently conducting a series of trafficking experiments. 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.760
 Plasma actually does not want to be present in the reactor. 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.800
 When it is finished, it creates quite a lot of mechanical energy, 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.489
 which is able to vibrate the entire reactor. And in future power plants 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.649
 we certainly want to avoid these problems. 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.879
 So, right now, the huge, seven hundred tons of big flywheels spin, 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:51.760
 to provide enough energy for the experiment itself. 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.719
 Less than a hundredth of a gram of gas is prepared in a vacuum vessel next to the toroid 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:00.479
 and when the pulse starts, it pushes him in and he gets warmed up with 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:03.679
 huge magnets, by injection of hydrogen atoms 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.310
 and by the power of the radio frequency waves that drift in. 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.659
 This creates superheated plasma. 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.079
 And when it reaches a temperature of about 100 million degrees Celsius, 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:17.549
 we will see our own nuclear fusion. 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.579
 At atom splitting, you always try to slow down and actually control the reaction. 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:26.450
 And we do the exact opposite. 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:30.789
 And so it is not possible for us to get into a situation, 

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:33.899
 where an accident of huge dimensions such as fission could occur. 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.359
 There are a lot of device protection devices that track the whole experiment. 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:43.439
 If anything goes wrong, the power supply is cut off and the whole system simply stops. 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.219
 But there is also a protective system you would not have expected, 

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:47.359
 for safety if something is wrong. 

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:50.259
 Upper ceiling speakers are surround sound speakers 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.030
 connected to the microphones in the reactor hall where no one has access. 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.579
 These speakers transmit the sound of the experiment itself 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.229
 to the real-time control room team. As if standing- 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.819
 - as if this place where I stood was, 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.249
 right in the middle of that toroid. 

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.450
 And all that complicated device protection is definitely necessary, 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.760
 and each part of it. Computers can respond much faster than we do. 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.650
 This small delay between perception and response can make a difference 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.620
 between safe shutdown and a bit more expensive bills for repair. 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.710
 But if something goes wrong slightly, 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:25.200
 like when you hear the faint, strange sound of the engine in your car, 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.900
 people will notice it before computers. 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:35.600
 A few years back, we had an experiment disruption and we heard such a dull sound. 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.300
 We were able to determine the exact area where we were supposed to source the sound. 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.130
 Finally we found out that it was a vise holding a pipe. 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.090
 And we were immediately able to get into the area, 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.100
 where did we assume the sound was coming out, 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.280
 we found a trumpet and could fix the vice. 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.570
 Local engineers have taken human capacity, 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.520
 that feeling, which was developed several hundred million years of evolution, 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.280
 that something is slightly wrong, something does not fit, 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.310
 and they used it here, in one of the most amazing things, 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.910
 what humanity has ever built. 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.680
 OK. Now comes the pulse. 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.310
 (Five, four, three, two, one, zero ...) 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.650
