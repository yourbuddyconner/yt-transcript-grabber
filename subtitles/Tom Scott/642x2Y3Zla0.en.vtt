00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.469
 This is an unheated spice 

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:05.650
 This is water, ethanolic acid and coloring and flavoring 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.330
 And it has it in almost all franchise stores in Britain 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.830
 this is the "vinegar" you will get 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.419
 And in modern life there are several advantages. 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.530
 It can be made from concentrate 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.760
 which facilitates the seller's work 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.210
 in fact, if they do not forget to divide it 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.710
 This continued several times 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.860
 And that's also a Halloway (safe for Muslims), the charge contains very little alcohol. 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.280
 than normal vinegar 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.240
 and even some brands of gluten-free (this is what makes me ugly) 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.899
 where normal vinegar is not. 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:37.070
 I have seen such vinegar sold as high quality. 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.160
 But that's not the reason to investigate 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.210
 There are ideas that say that this thing started the temperamental movement 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.730
 of people who are against alcohol from the 19th and early 20th centuries, 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.409
 but I can not find a trusty source for that 

00:00:47.409 --> 00:00:48.739
 ha "spring" 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.719
 I can not find a trusting man for this. 

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.059
 the reason is that the mixing of chemicals 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.910
 is much cheaper than its cooking. 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.320
 It has been for a very long time 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:05.229
 There is a reference from her Majesty's Food Inspectorate that it existed 100 years ago. 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.220
 But now can not formally be called vinegar 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.250
 Ministry and Food Standards 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.280
 are aware of this 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.670
 It can not be put in traditional bottles of vinegar that people love 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.329
 But without every potato shop in the country, they do not care 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:21.630
 and Trading Standards .... 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.119
 they can tour every store in the country 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.610
 and forbid it, but they do not 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.100
 There are good things to do 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.409
 like following foods that can really hurt you 

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.560
 And they do not want a penny of the money from the fines 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.259
 And most people do not know this is not vinegar 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.390
 And those who know are not interested 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.110
 it's not like margarine or butter 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.060
 where with chemicals the health effects are different 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.579
 just a little different taste and bottling 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.909
 But nobody cares about it, no one deals. Throughout the country 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.740
 everyone agrees: it's good. It's vinegar 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.260
 Here is the question: Is it different? 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.980
