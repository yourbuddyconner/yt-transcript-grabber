00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:02.100
 Game (head) ....... People love the game 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.100
 New video game See for ratings! 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:12.040
 Everyone loves the game, saying it's a tough game but I have it easy 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.139
 One question ? 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:16.139
 simple 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.420
 Is it? 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.560
 Just? 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.560
 Like Dark Soles the hardest game in the world after I'm lost, I lost them 90 times in the first stage Haha 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.240
 Such as Dark Sols, Shooting Games or Dark Soles 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.639
 DarkSolez Chappe Fire Watch - The Crash Game has become a difficulty for Dark Soles 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.550
 Dark Soles in Space Joking 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.309
 The air of nature is a little like the Dark Soles - all the games are like Dark Soles 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:54.780
 Visit Boligon's favorite world page and discover 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.160
 It is very difficult 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.219
 she 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:00:59.219
 Is it like Dark Soles? 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.879
 From 2D shooters? 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.460
 Oh really!! 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.309
 Polygon You're wrong because I made some adjustments 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.900
 I wrote the journal myself and found some evidence to make it clear 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.130
 These clips are from 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.610
 I play a journalist and I will not name him and he has spent twenty-five years of his life 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.950
 In writing about entertaining games 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.669
 This is an explanation game play. I certainly love the game's amazing directions 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.630
 You know that he could not do this jump, I have not played the game yet 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.410
 So I do not know exactly 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:47.910
 But you seem to know that nasty in the game. 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.429
 I am a big fan of cartoon art 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.350
 In the 1920s and 1930s 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.730
 It's something I've used in my channel 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.729
 Feeling warm and nostalgic 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.839
 Only design and attention to detail is really unthinkable! 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.920
 Seeing how to integrate this and form it into a game that knows this is a very creative idea 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.149
 It is easy to say that they made a great effort to put the most accurate details and make this possible 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.209
 I did it yes ... 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.139
 Thank you to the Lord - In a defense of the attack on him the man said that those who attack him have not played the game yet 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:35.489
 "They told me faithfully the first 26 minutes of the game so I would do what the journalist said (filming 26 minutes of play) 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.829
 You are about to watch Beydipay playing his first 26 minutes of Cap Head game 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:43.450
 Non-produced (you will not be too lazy) 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.400
 Video is a complete 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.790
 I have a lot of stuff to do today and I do not have time to edit the video. I'm sorry I'm very nervous and busy 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.340
 Maybe come on really tough 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.140
 Well Well Well, here we are, this is the explanation of the game 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.820
 God! - I did not know that pressing the Shift button until 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.700
 - God - it's cold - it's cold - it's cold - it's cold - it's cold - it's cold - it's cold - it's cold. 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:39.380
 Probably the hardest 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.360
 I do not mean to look like an elitist or whether people are bad, in games. I could not care less, but if I was writing reviews 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:01.340
 About the Games How anyone can trust what you say when you clearly do not care to play a game 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:04.780
 Correct and good 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.980
 How can you struggle with this you do not even have to press the direction ... correct 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.200
 I love it, this game is very beautiful 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:28.640
 Hey, do you know why? This game is just like the 'Legend of the Brofist'! Can you buy stuff? 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.200
 Oh my God, this is so cool. Extra beating points? Okay. 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:48.780
 I love everything about music just because you die and explode or whatever is so cool. 

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:55.439
 I think this is my first honest 26 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:02.789
 Honest minute 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:06.599
 It's very tough, I'm not lying 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:09.930
 I was surprised and I made this much. 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:17.939
 I must, I must be a very lucky look at these skills. I have not played until 25 years 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.610
 I played more like 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.280
 22 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:25.410
 Got them 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:34.560
 , Wait, those I can see, I forgot. I thought they were enemies 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:40.169
 Did not I just take the damage? In Dar Sok, it does not work like that 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.889
 Hey look at it. He did jump 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.910
 My God is seriously what this game is impossible 

00:05:50.199 --> 00:05:52.199
 no 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:56.519
 Are you kidding me, and you're up to it ... it's all? 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.360
 You better be flirting 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.840
 Fine you know just fine I died at the first level Everyone needs to relax 

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.520
 What is this leader 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:21.060
 There you go look at that look at those left and right skills 

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.100
 My God 

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.640
 Why did not I go for one coin? 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:37.590
 I was right at the end I knew what you know what, yes the game is tough, whatever 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.910
 This shit is really embarrassing there are things everywhere cold in Malaysia 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:53.670
 Hey look Yeah look at it when did you take me 26 minutes? It's Hell Yeah 

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.030
 Gimme that A +, A + Gimmie that 

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:04.530
 Come on A +, I'm a plus gamer, everyone knows it, A +, and - sure he's Biekhad B 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:10.530
 This game is just like dark souls. That's just it 

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:17.039
 Well it could have been really embarrassing 

00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:21.030
 What 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.590
 Is this leader? 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:29.979
 So I think that this game was originally supposed to be just like a game of a leader or whatever 

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:37.150
 But he received a lot of attention that they want to make the game complete 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:42.129
 Which I am glad they did, this reminds us of Sonic too much. This game is just like the Dark Souls Sonic Edition 

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.280
 This is wonderful 

00:07:51.710 --> 00:07:55.750
 Well okay whatever, no matter how zero deaths, well do not count 

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:04.210
 What the hell that makes no sense 

00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:21.539
 Do you know what they are, fine do not want to play stupid leader anyway stupid stupid games no matter what the game is whatever. Well, shut up 

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.840
 What do we have here? 

00:08:26.139 --> 00:08:32.819
 The thing to remember is that with all the old games used to be as hard as once a day 

00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:38.099
 I've never been able to finish a lot of games that I played like Donkey Kong Country or whatever 

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:48.149
 But that does not mean I enjoyed less think at the moment when developers have much statistics on everything they know quite well 

00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:53.279
 Whether the person finished the game or not what places he died most on 

00:08:53.770 --> 00:08:58.829
 I just created this attitude that everyone should be able to finish the game otherwise, 

00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:02.369
 It's not a good game, when that's not necessarily true at all 

00:09:04.209 --> 00:09:07.289
 This is just my opinion 

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:13.380
 Difficulty in games. This leader is crazy dude looks very cool. 

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:16.110
 Fight the Illuminati carrot? 

00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:19.409
 'Cause if so, I run 

00:09:23.250 --> 00:09:30.349
 Hey, it's a first knockout right of death just zero zero deaths just like dark souls, just like the spirit of darkness 

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.140
 Give me that A + FA (sure it's BJ + B) 

00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.440
 But you have to parry three times to get - what - all 

00:09:38.370 --> 00:09:40.429
 Level five skill 

00:09:41.339 --> 00:09:46.969
 Level skills, consider this skill level. I knew I loved him before you played but cursed 

00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:51.829
 love it. Damn you gotta have at least a divine reaction to dealing with this leader 

00:09:56.880 --> 00:09:58.880
 I'm guessing I have to shoot these 

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:04.220
 Oh no 

00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:08.640
 What happens What do I do? 

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:24.350
 Well this one is hard, dude. You never know what gonna happen-ok we're in good shape. What the hell, my God 

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.320
 what should I do? 

00:10:32.130 --> 00:10:34.549
 I think we have to Barry it? Oh well there we go. 

00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:40.429
 What do I get for a frog? Got the frog, excellent. Stop! 

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:46.280
 I mean hey hey hey hey 

00:10:50.850 --> 00:10:54.080
 very nice! Come on. Give me something good 

00:10:56.250 --> 00:10:58.250
 Tiger Hey 

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:00.500
 Wonderful 

00:11:03.930 --> 00:11:05.930
 Hey Laurie, Gah! Uh! 

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:09.750
 Yes 

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:11.550
 another one 

00:11:11.550 --> 00:11:13.550
 No, are you kidding me ??? 

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.760
 Die in the easy part I think I should do it three times 

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.610
 But man, I can not this is difficult !! 

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:28.489
 It goes faster! My speed is non-agricultural, oh I did it 

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.720
 Last one - stupid coin! 

00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.000
 Come on stupid game! 

00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.190
 Please give me a challenge 

00:11:51.630 --> 00:11:55.489
 O match a little tough. Very difficult game 

00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:03.020
 No god damn boys. Give me balls. I do not even know how these work 

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:16.059
 It's all knockout, zero death, zero! Just like journalists have zero skills. 

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:23.979
 My Jah! Look at that first attempt, which was the first look try in it. What do you mean I was not Barry? 

00:12:24.769 --> 00:12:29.078
 what do you mean? Why do I have to parry? That was ten out of ten, baby! 

00:12:29.839 --> 00:12:35.229
 Get Weta here. How can I Barry seriously? I do not know how Barry Barry was not in the games. Okay? I never do 

00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.779
 Really another dude leader, how many leaders there? 

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.809
 How do I die? Oh, I have to defend 

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.769
 Well okay okay? How can I get rid of it? Barry got them right? 

00:13:01.910 --> 00:13:04.509
 do not touch! do not touch! Yachmar Laatlas 

00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:15.520
 But I did three times Barry did not I? This is just like tennis, you know you go, then go back then go 

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:23.079
 Victory First try everyone, try first. Thanks. Defend the Earth just like Dark Soles 

00:13:28.190 --> 00:13:33.459
 Oh boy! You know that this is the only thing in the game missing a creative voice representation 

00:13:33.460 --> 00:13:35.460
 II I think I can do a good job at it 

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:46.690
 I love the game and I think it's very fun 

00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:48.280
 I can not just wait to play more 

00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:54.879
 But we're gonna end those there. Now you should expose them to anyone for being bad at games not at all 

00:13:56.300 --> 00:13:58.959
 But the game must be judged differently because it is difficult 

00:14:00.410 --> 00:14:02.410
 Get out of here 

00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:09.490
 Go home, then you do not understand the man. Difficult games are not only there to make it challenging 

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:13.629
 It's to make it rewarding when you beat it is not clear? 

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:19.080
 Maybe this is obvious but in fact it does not seem to matter when you see every single media outlet 

00:14:19.660 --> 00:14:23.900
 Compare tough games to dark souls because that's all that matters. 

00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:26.440
 Do men read "all you need is kill? 

00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:30.220
 It's manga based on the kind of the same concept. (By Anime and Manja where are you Yautaku) 

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:34.260
 He's every time ... The guy is not very good at fighting, you know. 

00:14:34.670 --> 00:14:37.120
 But every time he dies he gets to try again 

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:43.870
 Then again, again and again soon will become such a master scenario of the war itself 

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:45.580
 The same thing with games 

00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:51.249
 You know you do not necessarily have to make it on the first try then before its end 

00:14:51.250 --> 00:14:56.230
 You're a master of this level and you just finished it, and you can get that feeling 

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.689
 Hell Yeah, I learned something that became better in something 

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.240
 This is what fun. 

00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.650
 Anyway, this Cuphead lets you like if you enjoy watching the Malaysian squad to come out I wish you a wonderful translation Haha Norte Yaarb
