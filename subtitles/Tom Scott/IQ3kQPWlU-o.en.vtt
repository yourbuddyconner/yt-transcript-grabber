00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.020
 TOM SCOT: I'm here for the Junior Winter Olympics 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.439
 in Lillehammer, Norway. 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:06.319
 It's still the beginning of the season, 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:08.060
 so they use snow machines. 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:11.290
 It is not easy to meet the requirements for the slopes. 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.059
 ROGER HJELMSTADSTUEN: Here in Haifel we have about 250 cannons for snow 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.850
 All of them are controlled by one place. 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.370
 and all are connected. 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.980
 It is most important to put the machines in the right places. 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.740
 Otherwise the wind can bear the snow outside the track. 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.810
 That's why it's working twice a day in two shifts 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.739
 all winter, all winter, to make sure everything is perfect. 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.539
 TC: In the snow machine, huge amounts of water and air 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.579
 are injected through miniature nozzles, 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.519
 creating a fine fog that turns into snow. 

00:00:44.519 --> 00:00:46.579
 But although it's cold, 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.260
 the temperature is actually not below zero. 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.789
 Then how does the water freeze? 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:53.579
 Why does not it just rain like rain? 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:54.819
 All right. Physics. 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:59.179
 When the water evaporates, it takes heat from the environment in which it is located. 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:01.050
 If you wet your hand and blow it on it, 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.379
 you will feel cold, 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.140
 because the evaporating water takes away heat from your body. 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.570
 This is happening here as well. 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.200
 Some of these water droplets evaporate 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.490
 and so the temperature around them falls. 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.130
 Which means other droplets may freeze. 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.110
 Once this happens, the so-called crystallisation centers, 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.170
 from which snowflakes are born. 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.180
 And if the machine does not do well enough, 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.400
 one type of protein slurry can be used. 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.890
 It is added in very small quantity to the water 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.930
 and then each droplet becomes the center of crystallization 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.280
 and can form its own snowflake. 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.880
 RH: To make snow, we need water and air pipes. 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.580
 Each machine must also be connected to a data cable. 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.420
 The water here comes from large lakes on the top of the mountain, 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.200
 from where it goes down without the need for extra pressure. 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.180
 This is easiest and cheapest. 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.180
 We usually use about 30,000 liters per minute. 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.540
 It sounds like a lot of water, but we have a very large lake. 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.990
 So during the season his level drops by no more than 5-10 cm. 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.860
 And that is, if it is not filled from nowhere. 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.420
 So most of the time your lake looks the same way. 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.620
 TC: The drier the air, more water can evaporate into it. 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.930
 So if the air is very, very dry - 0% humidity, 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.159
 can produce snow and when the air temperature 

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.769
 is well above zero - up to 6 ° C. 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.180
 But if the air is damp, it is not possible to evaporate all these droplets. 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.540
 At 100% humidity, when the air is saturated, 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.790
 the temperature should be at least -2 ° C to form snow. 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.939
 This is not a magical freezer machine. 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.480
 The laws of thermodynamics make this impossible. 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.340
 However great it would be for snow machines to work in the middle of the summer, 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.980
 what we would get then ... 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.829
 ... is a machine for rain. 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:49.060
 RH: Good snow cover is very important for big races, 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.900
 but it is also very important for 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:54.069
 the ordinary skiers here in Hafiel. 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:56.769
 We need snow to have slopes. 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.029
 Without him we are nothing. There's no snow! 

00:02:59.029 --> 00:03:02.010
 TC: There are still many videos on the Olympic channel, 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.340
 as well as on my channel - watch them and subscribe. 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.230
 And I thank the Junior Olympic Games 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.959
 about the opportunity to come here to Lillehammer. 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.900
