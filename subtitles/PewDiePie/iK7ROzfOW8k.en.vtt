00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.150
 My dream is to become a star on YouTube 

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:04.750
 F 

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.640
 So I'll try to .. (laughs) 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.960
 Great ! Another child on Dr. Phil 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:10.775
 She wants to become a star on YouTube 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.259
 Let's start to see the style here! 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.730
 (On the left side) is mentally ill 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:16.780
 (On the right side) 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:18.780
 Mmmmmmmmm (twisted effect) 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.320
 How are you! Lush here 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.960
 And welcome to invite children weekly 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:31.620
 Laugh 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.760
 Before we go to the shape of Logan Paul .. let's take a quick course 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.400
 Hey, hey Nicole, how's it going? Everything is perfect today? 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.400
 Yes I am in good condition 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.340
 Listen 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:50.000
 There are many people who hate you online and .. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.620
 Do not make it famous and it does not deserve fame 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.100
 They just hate me! 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:00.300
 They just hate me! 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.890
 Just breaks in laughter. Hey, well my name is .. 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.580
 Do they want to become like you? 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.580
 Yes, they are just hateful 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.759
 Well .. you still will get your C-Bugger you talked about in Dr. Phil !!! 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.940
 What? .. I'm sorry .. What! 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.599
 Even the person who left behind says "What?" After all this the mother bought her the car? 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.660
 Are you Tamazhini? !! 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.300
 You literally need to vent and no one wants to listen to me 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.090
 Well you're not wrong with that what sits in the g-and-wang 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.230
 She has all the bags in her back and has done a lot of surgery and she is 15 Jesus Christ, dude. what a hell? 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.859
 Hey, hey, our kids call it the week. Everything is allowed. Everything is fine, ok. We have to go ahead though 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.259
 I have three YouTube channels. It's almost my old videos that I posted about makeup lessons 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.959
 What has three channels? 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.160
 Reminds me 2014 * when you use legitimate games? * 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:23.599
 Youtube where everyone was like ya, my vlogging channel. Here's my game channel because I like games 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.409
 Well, not because he's famous because I'm a great passionate player. Well, these are my technical review channels 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.470
 This I also have some videos on the YouTube channel called dare Mondays 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.989
 It's my favorite program. Well, it's my favorite program on YouTube. Love her. I love her dare on Monday stuff 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:03.629
 its the best 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.599
 None of my videos got the most views I got on YouTube 

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:11.658
 85 was only 85 views 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.019
 Well, as you know, it was not like I used to update old videos * The older videos were the best * 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.010
 So they seem to have gotten more reviews 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:25.009
 This did not happen 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:32.209
 Well, do not feel bad about you, so you should feel bad about getting 85 views. This is pathetic 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.760
 Also, I do not understand dare the two look very good. Well number one, Joey Grisva 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.240
 he is 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.100
 Well, it's as perverted as Shin Dawson 

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:59.329
 Imagine how good it would be if people watched old videos that might be worse 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:06.679
 Well, how boys and girls walk. My name is Peeewdipah and welcome to comment blackops. I'm allowed to 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:10.879
 I liked how I liked my videos at the time. Well, okay okay 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:16.279
 She wants to become a star on YouTube, but what's wrong with it? I feel that I have a bright future ahead of me 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.359
 I just think Kimber needs to get out of my life. I 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.329
 My mother is called Kimber, her mother is literally 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.560
 Susan and Jessica, see you on YouTube (by chance?) 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:40.839
 I usually go to the ski park. This is in this section a good video blog portal really enjoyed those blogs 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:47.649
 This is me in the ski park. I will definitely lie this when I drive 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:53.950
 I will not lie well. Okay. Let's see the doctor sit with the legendary doctor 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.170
 Why every comment you play? 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:59.150
 sarcastic. 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.250
 Because I think that's funny, I'm not so important 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:09.780
 This is that she was sitting right on why Susan really hates having to show her own video clips 

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.640
 Why is everything you say defensive and cynical? 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:19.340
 Because 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:24.730
 She will try to knock me away and find my weak point 

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:26.530
 I do not have a weak point right now * do not you? 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.260
 I will never mourn at the age of 50, but I may be able to find a few weaknesses 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:37.689
 But just getting to get going like Logan Paul. Probably not the greatest thing 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:40.060
 How do you know what I will do? 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:50.230
 I just know I've been watching you since I was young and I know every aspect of everything 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.800
 (Laughs audience) 

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.190
 Well, I've been teaching you d 

00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:00.469
 Phil I've been watching you since I was fine 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.970
 I know every aspect of everything that this child looks like in school 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.660
 I watched porn before everyone was like men 

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:14.569
 I know things. Okay. I've seen the prophecy I've seen so I've seen everything okay * lmaoo * 

00:06:14.569 --> 00:06:20.269
 There is nothing you can tell me because I already know him. I mean it's television. It is not that difficult 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:27.799
 YouTube vs TV Everyone. I did not say that school was stupid 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.729
 But you have to get some kind of education 

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:37.340
 Or you will not get a job. You can not do anything 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.259
 Well, what happened was to become a utilitarian and do not need anything to become a utopian user. I 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.440
 I feel that this is the dream of children these days. It's like the easy way now. You can just become a YouTube 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.849
 You do not even need to go to school. You can only play games. I still see people spreading like 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.370
 I only play video games for 10 minutes 

00:06:55.470 --> 00:07:01.130
 That's all you did. You're not saying you're not wrong, but you guys, it's really hard. Okay 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:17.710
 Hair, make up and investigate the crime scene everyone will end up and match 

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:25.329
 Why did not anyone try to study it before? This is all you need to teach to become a YouTube 

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:30.849
 I will study music and I will study frogs well, if you do not give me a job 

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:35.020
 I do not know what will happen, but we do not know that cuz is not in bubble bubbles. Not funny 

00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.960
 Like why? Is that funny? Huh? Why is this funny mom? 

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:43.629
 Why can not I study poetry and investigate the crime scene? Yes. What is a psychiatric patient? 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.740
 Unnamed: Um, it ruined my life for the money you set forth, okay 

00:08:02.420 --> 00:08:09.069
 Just like you do not think it's true. You do not think as a normal human being will look like they describe themselves * lol * 

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.560
 You do not have a thinking process 

00:08:13.430 --> 00:08:18.789
 Well, what you do not have a thinking process for you 

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:34.059
 I think what you are saying is that you are not communicating 

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:39.340
 I do not want to do anything with her but last night you wanted me to come and grab your legs and do it 

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.920
 The things. Yes, I want you to do things for me 

00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:56.260
 Rub my Mom's legs like once I get a GED I can start my life 

00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:00.550
 Because I am already an adult I have been an adult since I was young 

00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:05.140
 Through your profile 

00:09:05.150 --> 00:09:12.220
 Literally one minute ago the psychopath was exactly what you mentally do not think about your age and you have 

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:18.940
 You do not think your mind is your age. I did not do anything for you at all 

00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.250
 No, do not do anything 

00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:27.290
 Nanny and Papa are things for me. I've bought everything. Did not buy me a car until * wtf * 

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:33.410
 What is with these children and getting cars? I did not get a car when I was a kid. Yes 

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:41.840
 No wonder many YouTube users are psychologically ill because all psychopaths want to be YouTube users. Logan will now make logical sense, in the end 

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:49.280
 Let's see the perspective of parents. I am curious about what parents will say to defend themselves. There are some things 

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:52.220
 I had not done that 

00:09:52.350 --> 00:09:58.999
 Right in my country we did not justify well that we did. There is no book about it and I have no idea 

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:14.900
 But why did you buy my book and that would never have happened 

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:17.869
 This is a strange look. I think it's interesting though 

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:22.940
 How many children would like this idea to be aware of YouTube users? 

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:26.299
 They are famous for earning a lot of money. You know, you do not have to go to school 

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:31.220
 You do not have to do all these things. It's like it's like an easy way out. Looks like and, yes, inish 

00:10:31.220 --> 00:10:36.680
 Thank you guys to see this video leave like if you enjoy watching and let me know what * like it * 

00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.180
 Since I'm basically the new leafy second let me know what should be called to the kids afterwards 

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:47.700
 Let me know in the comments and would like if you are a nine year old kid and wa wait, I can just call you guys * im 4 *
