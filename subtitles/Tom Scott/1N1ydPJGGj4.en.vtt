00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.150
 In America, alcoholic beverages must be radioactive so they can be legally consumed. 

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:06.300
 Sounds stupid, appearing in such lists as: 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.180
 "Fourteen special things you'll never believe," 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.720
 for which, for some reason, resources are never given. 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.300
 But this is really true. To find out why, 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.580
 we need to use some knowledge of chemistry. 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.520
 Earth is constantly bombarded with cosmic rays 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.990
 and radiation with incredibly great energy coming from space. 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.240
 Our atmosphere almost completely protects us, 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.470
 but this "almost" causes strange chemical reactions. 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.720
 When the cosmic ray is hit by nitrogen, 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.520
 there will be something called carbon 14, 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.450
 which is a heavy and somewhat unstable carbon isotope. 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.460
 This isotope is constantly produced high in the atmosphere. 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.950
 And when it is established, the half-life is several thousand years old. 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.320
 Then it falls back to the nitrogen. So at any moment 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.180
 there is a very small part of the carbon in the world, 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.800
 about one billion, made up of this radioactive version. 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.539
 The exact number varies, which depends on many things, 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.460
 which also include whether we launch atomic bombs. But the conclusion is: 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.260
 Part of the carbon on Earth is radioactive. 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.600
 And anything that is organic and alive exchanges carbon with the surrounding environment. 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.049
 Plants take nutrients from the soil, 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.009
 herbivores eat plants, 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.740
 carnivores eat herbivores who eat plants. 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.990
 So carbon in any living organism, 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.959
 including you and me, is constantly changing. 

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:25.049
 A small part of this exchange is the radioactive isotope of carbon. 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.060
 But when an organism dies, it stops exchanging carbon with its surroundings. 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.659
 No new carbon comes and no old one leaves. 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.770
 And so a small amount of radioactive carbon in the dead bodies begins to fall into nitrogen. 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.959
 Slow, very slow. But thanks to this, the radiocarbon method of age determination works. 

00:01:41.959 --> 00:01:46.020
 Because we know that the half-life of this isotope is about six thousand years, 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.539
 we can remove from a sample and 

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:51.590
 to determine the amount of this isotope. And if it has half the amount we would expect in today's living organism, 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.149
 we can say that it had to stop changing the carbon, 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.829
 that it had to die, about six thousand years ago. 

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:00.249
 And yes, in fact, it's much more complicated than I described. 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:03.319
 So complicated that someone won the Nobel Prize. 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.840
 But this is a video on YouTube and not a course of forensic science, so that's enough. 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.079
 Good. Keep this still in your head. 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:14.790
 Because alcohol intended for consumption is distilled from plants. 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.180
 In America, this is the only legal way. 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.319
 But it is also possible to produce alcohol from oil, 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.900
 what was drilled from the ground. 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.390
 You can not sell this alcohol in America, it's forbidden. 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.849
 You can only drink something that has been made from recently dead plants. 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.510
 But you can not drink what was made of long dead plants and, like, a random dinosaur. 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.769
 Of things that have been transformed into oil in millions of years of underground pressure. 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.780
 Although alcohol from plants and alcohol from oil is chemically the same substance. 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.109
 The only difference between them is the amount of radioactive carbon. 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.849
 When alcohol is distilled from plants, it is still present. 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.069
 The resulting fluid will be a little radioactive. 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.120
 Just as you are radioactive, me and the plants you come from. 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.659
 Distilled alcohol from oil, which has long been underground, 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:01.579
 where it has been protected from cosmic rays for many millions of years, 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.799
 contains almost no radioactive carbon. 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.650
 When you test this alcohol and it will not be radioactive, 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.749
 it is clear that it had to be made of oil. 

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:15.959
 Alcohol, the right alcohol, must be radioactive. 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:16.810
 Cheers! 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.019
 Like, it's water. This is, of course, water. 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:23.069
 If I did this for the fifth time, I'd be rolling under the table. 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:25.620
