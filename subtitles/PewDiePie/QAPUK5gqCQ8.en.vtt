00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.820
 I am still alive 

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.540
 damn it 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.060
 God bless you Mr. Beast 

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:05.580
 Bless your soul 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.580
 It seems that there is no hope. 

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.220
 Everyone is pushing 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.420
 Pewdiepie is to be replaced 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.180
 Pewdiepie 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.180
 Everyone’s media is cheering 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:14.960
 awesome 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.460
 This Indian company 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.900
 It’s me except to discuss him. 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.300
 But Mr. Beast 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.420
 You saved me 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.420
 I owe you a life, thank you. 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.420
 I bought a bunch of advertising billboards. 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.000
 Hey everyone, I bought a double-layer advertising board. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.900
 We won't mess up 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.420
 On TV 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.380
 Pick up your phone and go to Youtube to search for pewdiepie 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.700
 Then subscribe to him 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.900
 Broadcasting 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.100
 No one kills the "stalk" 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.800
 Faster and more efficient than this Swede 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.100
 I still have the last move. 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.600
 I haven't used it yet, okay? 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.700
 Because I don't need to use him yet. 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.300
 An Indian channel 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.800
 Just over the pewdiepie to become the most popular youtube channel 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.100
 You said that there are millions of dollars in companies and thousands of employees. 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.100
 Upload 5-10 videos a day 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.300
 There are advertisements everywhere, and people who read must understand Hindi. 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.300
 Will fight against an independent homemade film 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.100
 People who come to today 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.700
 He made a film at home 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.700
 It took 5-6 years to become the first youtuber 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.600
 His fans all over the world 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.700
 Made a lot of effort 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.700
 Ok, this is a bit exaggerated. 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.500
 Even if there are many because the copyright is warned 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.000
 This is no exaggeration. 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.200
 He doesn't care, he will continue to make videos for his fans. 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.700
 And he is always the first in the hearts of fans. 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.700
 This heart 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.900
 It’s interesting that many people hate me very much. 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.900
 They will definitely congratulate anyone 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.000
 To replace me 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.700
 a pile of acid 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.700
 You can continue to acid for a few days. 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.400
 Because we haven't lost yet! 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.500
 Mr. Beast's influence 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.200
 This is too crazy 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.000
 Honestly 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.200
 How much do I have now? 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.800
 I have more than 6,000.. 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.260
 Really useful 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.260
 When all hopes seem to fall through 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
 It’s like a "magic ring" 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.260
 When that moment comes, you know 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.800
 You know what I am talking about, less coming. 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.800
 Pentagonal, hexagonal 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.800
 Octagonal type, main income type 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.900
 what can I say 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.800
 I learned the lesson because of my moral standards. 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.500
 No other reason 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.900
 Look at this, you really work hard 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.800
 Not? 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.700
 Put this on just remind 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.800
 We are completely successful 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.000
 Because T-series has almost no followers of Twitter 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.800
 I do not quite understand 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.600
 The whole thing made me too confused. 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.200
 You may have won one, but you haven’t won yet. 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.860
 They haven't won yet! 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.140
痾痾痾痾痾痾

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.600
 Operating spacex and tesla 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.400
 Hosting the stalk review with pewdiepie 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.200
 Come on Elon, we need your help. 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.400
 Please, Elon Musk, please. 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.400
 Please, Elon Musk 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.400
 Don't send this trash to me anymore. 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.500
 There are very fake tweets now. 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.500
 I think this is also fake. 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.000
 Some people just can't let go 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 Look at another fake Twitter 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
 Multi-original 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.100
 Ok, we will shoot scared pewdiepie season 2 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.100
 But will I do this? 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.600
 It’s time to start* 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.400
 I think this means 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.400
 I think I am getting old, it is too young for me. 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.000
 Imagine writing something but not erasing it 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.080
 This gave me an idea 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.080
 Imagine that you are now eight years old. 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.080
 Someone 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.080
 Someone lost, you know the stalk 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.240
 Some are hidden, not everyone understands 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.420
 When you were 80 years old, someone knocked you with Uganda’s ring. 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.020
 Then there is a person like this 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.180
 Degree, then put a face 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.200
 Faces...not ancient relics, ancient symbols 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.760
 represents.. 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.000
 Your face 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.640
 Come back to me 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.460
 Imagine writing something that cannot be erased 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.680
 This announcement was posted by a pencil 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.120
 The pencil help sponsors this film喔

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.540
 Thank you very much for helping the pencil 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.360
 Pencil help decide to join us against T-Series 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.080
 Don't worry about pencils helping everything. 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.760
 Felix, are you thinking in English or Swedish? 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.580
 I don't know XD either. 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.320
 Have you ever thought about your thoughts? 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:50.720
 No, I never thought about it. 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:51.940
 Should be in English 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:55.720
 Sometimes I will say a lot of dreams, Mazia said that I speak Swedish. 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:59.940
 So I think, I still have some Sweden over there. 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.280
 Kick and call 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.060
 He bought all the advertising billboards in this city for this 

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.440
 If you haven't seen this video yet 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.460
 Go and have a look at the link. 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.000
 Bless you Mr. Beast 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.080
 If someone is standing out now 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:18.900
 If there are other youtubers standing up in this war 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.900
 The history of which side you will stand on 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.000
 Channel (...) 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.720
 I did this for pewds, I hope your naive audience will like it. 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.120
 This is very interesting喔

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.800
 Do not lie to you 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.880
 Unless they don't accept my challenge! 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.560
 You don't understand the taste of my Twitter followers at all. 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.580
 You don't even want to know 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.560
 Why are you crying so loudly? 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:41.360
 I am proud of marzia making this major decision today. 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.480
 Goodbye youtube 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.180
 We can take an F to this chart. 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.820
 At least she can't give me a channel. 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.240
 So I can be a member of the T-Series, if there is sponsorship. 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.420
 Felix don't forget to turn the five-minute film into ten minutes. 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.740
 Why do you have to do it for five minutes? 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:02.400
 Become twenty minutes 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.400
 I wonder if I can get more time to watch. 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.060
 Because you know, youtube mainly depends on your viewing time. 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.060
 The longer the viewing time, the better 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:11.600
 So if I do this 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.000
 Try this movie to see how 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.080
 Pewds: When are you going to review? 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:15.040
 Elon: midnight 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.820
 (patted) 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:17.700
 Oh, this tweet is not completely fake. 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:18.400
 I didn't expect it. 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.000
 I am still waiting for you elon 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:22.000
 We need you to help elon 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:23.880
 Help me with elon sauce 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.720
 I know that he understands this stalk. 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.860
 Damn Hari House 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.780
 I watched the video of hus, we will go to see doctor david tomorrow. 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.980
 What is pewdiepie, why should I ask you to subscribe to him? 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.980
 I made my part 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:46.160
 When you find pewdiepie is not the first youtuber to get 69 million clicks 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
 Come on, everyone, we have a goal. 

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.680
 We have a mission 

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.460
 Please 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:52.960
 This is my only request to everyone. 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.720
 In addition to hoping to subscribe to your lifelong subscription 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:56.340
 In addition to this 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.880
 But please, everyone, this is my only one. 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.460
 I can buy youtube and delete the T-Series. 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.460
 This is really a good idea. 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.980
 Upload scared pewdiepie season 2 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:08.840
 But why should I do this? 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:09.960
 damn it 

00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:11.640
 Just a little 

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.640
 I almost believed that this tweet is true. 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.680
 Incredible 

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.440
 I plan to make a film about giving an apology to others to score points. 

00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:18.980
 Do it 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.100
 I have already done it, go see it. Still quite good 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.860
 I hope I can have more apologies. 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:26.860
 But after a long time, I don’t know why. 

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:31.680
 I wore pewdiepie clothes when I got married today. 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:34.780
 Look at this, you are a virgin. 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:35.940
 Washed 

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:39.920
 Even if you are only nine years old, you can find the true love of life. 

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.920
 All you need is to buy my goods. 

00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.700
 I said this for a long time. 

00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:47.000
 This is really great, thank you, I am honored. 

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:53.040
 To be honest, the product I reviewed is the one I support the most. 

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:57.680
 I just want to say thank you very much. 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.060
 I really really appreciate it. 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.380
 Felix is ​​now married in your clothes. 

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.380
 Just put the kids on Felix. 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.040
 Just lick my wife. 

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:07.820
 Ok. Look at the next one. 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:08.680
 Defender 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:09.460
 Attacker 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.160
 But the most important thing is he is the best, happy birthday Felix 

00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:14.980
 This is really heart 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:16.980
 Except today is not my birthday, you are staying 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:24.840
 Logan Paul: Color blindness pretends to see the color, taste the dead mouse to open the real body joke 

00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.940
 Get a high budget for his youtube movie 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.680
 PewDiePie: Just kidding 

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:30.940
 in fact 

00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:32.700
 Actually not a joke 

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.080
 To tell the truth.. 

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.800
 It’s a joke, a joke 

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.620
 His program was cancelled because someone said he was a Nazi 

00:07:40.620 --> 00:07:41.840
 It doesn't matter that he is a vegetarian now. 

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:42.860
 This really 

00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.460
 Pretending that Felix has made Elon's humanoid legislation, then they are even co-hosted. 

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.580
 Nice, thank you 

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:51.300
 Elon Musk 

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:51.900
 Dr. Phil 

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:52.800
 Ben Shapiro 

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.800
 Prepare to host the stalk review together 

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.800
 come on 

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.420
 Come host 

00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:58.780
 anyone 

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:01.260
 I am proud of Marzia’s own choice to make this major decision. 

00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:05.840
 I hope that Marzia will find what she hopes in her life, and I hope that her future will be beautiful. 

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:09.000
 At the same time, I hope that T-Series will quickly come out with similar videos. 

00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.500
 Look forward to it. 

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:12.500
 Imagine you can hear the sound inside 

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.240
 Everyone~ 

00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.460
 We are going to announce today~ 

00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.460
 Stop bullying~ 

00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.820
 I hope this has a second one. 

00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.900
 Want all of them 

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.760
 I tried to contact this child. 

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:23.140
 But he did not reply 

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.240
 But I know that he left a comment in one of my films. 

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.000
 I know that you are listening. 

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.640
 Please, find your little friends. 

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.940
 I beg you 

00:08:29.940 --> 00:08:31.360
 Find your little friends and say 

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:32.160
 Everyone~ 

00:08:32.180 --> 00:08:33.380
 We are going to announce today~ 

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:35.820
 stem 

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:36.960
 Review ~~ 

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.960
 Ok, absolutely great. 

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:42.960
 The fans of pewdiepie are still not looking at reddit 

00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:46.780
 When will you be honest that you are doing your job? 

00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.780
 Don't look at it later. 

00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:52.340
 Let's go, I hope things are a bit different, okay? 

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:55.880
 You can't catch a Swede and say, sorry, Mr. Hitler Sa. 

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:57.880
 Please go to the founding of the country. 

00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.660
 What should we do in Europe? 

00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:01.160
 you can not do that 

00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:01.760
 That does not work 

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.540
 This is it 

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:03.600
 This looks pretty like mine 

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:04.920
 Is that the child of Mr. Super! 

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.920
 I am wrong... I am right. 

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.980
 The test is to get F 

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:12.880
 Found that the teacher is trying to win some respect 

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:15.280
 This is true.. nice 

00:09:16.520 --> 00:09:18.580
 Youtube, can you give me the money to pay the rent? 

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:19.940
 pay the rent? 

00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:20.760
 Yes~ 

00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:23.620
 In fact, I imagined a boss to buy some useless belts. 

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:24.980
 I still keep those belts 

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:26.980
 If someone can teach me how to use them 

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:27.840
 that's great 

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:28.560
 Thank you 

00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.240
 The troubles of the rich, right? 

00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.160
 This is what I always said 

00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.160
 The more money, the more troubles. 

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:36.060
 Goodbye youtube 

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:41.100
 Nothing is more fun than me. 

00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:42.340
 The old days of the nest 

00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.080
 Come to a pizza 

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.080
 Farewell to marzia 

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.280
 Imagine a subscribed button that looks like this 

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:50.600
 This picture is made by T-Series 

00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.760
喔~~~~~~~~~~ 

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.500
 The Last Supper 

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:55.300
 That's right 

00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:00.280
 Hello everyone, I am pewds, I want to discuss serious topics with you today. 

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.900
 Well, this is not bad. 

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:03.900
 Skulldino, are you doing this? 

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.900
 I want to confirm, yes. 

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:09.100
 God did a lot of it, it’s really good. 

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.000
 Thank you very much, very cool. 

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.000
 I don't know much about my channel. 

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.360
 Piewdiepie sugar candy 

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.480
 Styling chocolate candy 

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:16.740
 Can you do this? 

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.960
 Green packed lemon sugar, good 

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:21.260
 Pewdiepie pat 

00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:22.480
 Oh my God 

00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:23.740
 You lost the cookie when you laughed. 

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:24.960
 You lost if you ate. 

00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:26.720
 This idea is not bad. 

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.760
 ordinary 

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:29.760
 Double speed, baby. Spicy 

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:35.840
 I hope you like this double-speed movie, if you like it, you can now switch back to normal speed. 

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:37.480
 If you like, just press 

00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:38.180
 Kidding! 

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:39.000
 subscription! 

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.880
 Damn subscription! 

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.300
 This is our last chance 

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:45.980
 Listening well, I am fed up, okay? 

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:48.160
 I won't pretend that I like you. 

00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:48.980
 because I know 

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:50.980
 I only care about one thing, just one thing. 

00:10:51.460 --> 00:10:54.700
 More than 6.9 million earlier than that damn 

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.760
 You don't know what it is, you know what to do. 

00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.540
 Otherwise, the epic brothers will be lost. Yes, I have to take back the previous brothers. 

00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:05.140
 Unless we complete this great cause 

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:06.980
 Now you have a real motivation 

00:11:06.980 --> 00:11:08.500
 Now you have a real challenge 

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.500
 Now you have a passionate task 

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:12.980
 Let’s have a good fight, damn never look back. 

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:14.560
 What are you doing here? 

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.140
 Fast roll
