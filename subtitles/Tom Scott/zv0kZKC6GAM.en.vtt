00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.900
 There has just been a self-retweeting tweet on Twitter. 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.060
 And this should not happen. I mean, this is the most basic one of cyber security. 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.400
 If you don't know this yet, you should not design a commercial website. 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.760
 However, it appeared, 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:19.540
 The fans of the 10.1 million BBC mega news just saw a little red love. 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.300
 So how does it work? 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.840
 The web page is built using HTML. 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.840
 HTML is a tag-based language. 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.380
 So if I write this in the source code, 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.360
 Then write this at the end, 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.940
 Then everything between these two "tags" will be bold. 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.200
 B means Bold (bold). 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.480
 I am oversimplifying this mechanism, but this is almost the basic principle. 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.060
 In addition to the B tag, the I tag is italics. 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.960
 There are other complex labels for design and layout. 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.240
 There is also a special tag called Script. 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.460
 Script is a special tag. What it means is that no text on this side should be displayed to the user. 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:56.200
 This is not the text to display. 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.620
 This is not a picture. This is the program language code. 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.260
 This is the code that your web browser - Firefox, Chrome, IE - should run. 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.680
 But there is a very important rule, 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.380
 This is a way to prevent cross-site scripting attacks. 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.260
 If you have a text box, 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.100
 Even if it is something like a search box, 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.300
 You are absolutely, absolutely, absolutely not 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.780
 Throw the things in the text box back and forth. 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:22.100
 Because, for example, I can enter the B tag in Google's search box. 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.540
 Then I didn't close this tag, 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.520
 In the worst case, Google throws these things back and forth. 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.080
 Then suddenly after "you searched for Hello" - 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.380
 That B tag is not displayed, just indicates 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.220
 "Let the text bold" and the text will be bold. 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.900
 So the second half of the entire page was thickened, which ruined the page. 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.240
 The really dangerous thing is that I can type in this text box: 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.600
 Script. 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.100
 Because if you don't set the filter 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.900
 Just put the text I typed in the text box, 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.400
 For example, the text in the tweet, 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.860
 If you throw it back as it is, the label will appear on the web page. 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.180
 And will be run. 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:01.160
 just now…… 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.640
 This is twitter.com 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.300
 This is what you see on the website. 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.800
 This is the right approach. 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.840
 They transcoded these angle brackets. 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.900
 There is some code behind this, which means 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.200
 "This is a sharp bracket, not a code." 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:16.640
 This is the right approach. 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.760
 This is the code for the vulnerability. 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.560
 TweetDeck... 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.740
 ... forgot to check these contents. 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.760
 I mean, this is too basic. This is the most basic thing about cyber security. 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:30.500
 That filter is absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely can't be turned off. 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.640
 But it was turned off. 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.940
 So this text will be executed as code. 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.900
 So let's take a look and see. 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.760
 This is a script tag. 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.580
 This tag indicates everything inside, including the tag itself, 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.300
 It is not displayed on the page, but is executed as code. 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.680
 It also has a "class" called "xss" that will be used in a moment. 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.320
 The first instruction. 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.220
 Dollar sign. This symbol represents jQuery. 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.820
 jQuery is a development that makes development easy 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.380
 JavaScript plugin. 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.300
 Here is the beginning of this instruction, indicating 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:06.320
 "Find everything on the page that has the xss class." 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.180
 This is the script tag, 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.960
 right here. 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.980
 Basically, "Find me. Find myself. Find this code." 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.620
 Ok. 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.100
 Then the next piece of code, meaning 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.800
 "Find the upper element. Find everything that contains this code." 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.400
 This directive will give an ordered list in jQuery. 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.500
 Each item is a layer of "container." 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.040
 So, first of all, the paragraph containing the label, 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:32.640
 Then this is the box, right here. 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.200
 This is very important. It’s here. 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.880
 Then the entire tweet, the entire tweet list, 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.140
 The bigger piece on the page, the bigger piece, and the end is the entire page. 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.960
 It doesn't matter, it just gives a sorted list. 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.920
 This paragraph: "Find the second item in this list." 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.540
 The computer counts from zero, so 1 is the second item. 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:51.800
 zero one. 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.240
 Ok? The second item is this block. 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:57.620
 Ok? Next step. 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.260
 "Find all the A tags in this block." 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.820
 A tag is a hyperlink, something you can order. 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.300
 We can do this. They are here. 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:08.320
 This is the first one, this is the second, the third, the fourth. There are more below. 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.660
 This is a list of A tags (hyperlinks). 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:12.920
 Next, find the second item. 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.800
 The second item, look, is the retweet button. 

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:17.280
 Hey! click it. 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.800
 This is equivalent to the user clicking the retweet button. Not finished yet: 

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:22.660
 New instructions. 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.460
 Because the retweet button does not retweet immediately, a dialog box pops up. 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:27.340
 The content is "Are you sure you want to retweet?" 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.080
 Dollar sign, "Find me." 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:30.680
 "data-action". 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.460
 So it’s "find something that has data: 'reverse' action", 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.900
 This is the button. 

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.020
 Hey! This button is here. 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:41.620
 Point him. 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.460
 Hey! The retweet is complete and everyone has seen it. 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.200
 Again, this only happens on the TweetDeck where the filter is turned off. 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.940
 That filter is absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, and can never be turned off. 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.460
 We still have a place to write something. 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.180
 This is an interesting part. I mean, Andy, doing a good job. 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.820
 If this is your real name. I guess your account won't live too long. 

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:02.660
 We still have time to write the third instruction. 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.640
 We still have space. 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:09.900
 Alert (popup dialog). Is popping up an annoying dialog box, 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.800
 His content here is 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:14.640
 "Cross-site scripting attack (XSS)" - this is the attack - 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.000
 "...in the TweetDeck." 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.480
 Andy is here to tell you clearly what he did, 

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.420
 Just like what he just did. 

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:23.680
 Then, just a little bit friendly, 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.800
 He closed the script tag because he still has a place, 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.500
 Also very polite, just affecting a tweet, 

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.240
 Then just seem to have a little love, 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:32.580
 A love. 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.000
 Because they still have a space for words, when the tweet is sent out, 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.580
 All victims 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.460
 I won't see these messy codes. 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.860
 They just saw this little red love. 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.180
 Finished. 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:45.320
 This is how he works. 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:48.620
 Less than 140 words of code, 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.220
 And a negligent TweetDeck programmer. 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:56.760
 This is all the conditions we need to see the self-reversed tweets. 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.280
 And this is a remarkable damage 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:03.660
 Incredibly becoming a world communication 

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.400
 An important part. 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.240
 It’s worrying, isn’t it? 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.240
 (Translation: User670)
