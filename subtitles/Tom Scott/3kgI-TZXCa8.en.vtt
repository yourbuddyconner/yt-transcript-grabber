00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:03.280
 This is The Technical Difficulties, we play Citation Needed. 

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.220
 With me today, he reads books you know, Chris Joel! 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.340
 I fade quickly! 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.120
 Everyone's favorite Gary Brannan, Gary Brannan! 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.900
 Well, I have a tanker of whipped cream but the pump is broken. 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.680
 The bastiest man on the internet, Matt Gray! 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.120
 'Ello YouTube! 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:15.900
 Ve'domme. 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.440
 I have an article from Wikipedia for me and these people can not see it. 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.560
 Each correct fact gives a point and a count [TING]. 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.760
 And there is a prize for exceptionally good answers and that is ... 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.880
 And today we talk about Victor Lustig. 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.440
 On the French 'Top Gear', how do they report that the Stig has won? 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:32.920
 Victor Le Stig! 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.220
 Ayy! 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.420
 Can I have a vote for Mr. here? Is that a 'golfers applause' or 'cookies'? 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.860
 - That's not a cookie. -It is not a cookie. 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.140
 It is not a cookie. It is really not a cookie. 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.540
 Oh, my best, that's fine. 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.000
 Ah! I was hoping that it would be a lusty gentleman. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.620
 Victor Lust-ig! 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.560
 Oohrg! 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.820
 Lusty is not correct, but he certainly had an interesting life. 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:57.160
 Was he lively? 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.520
 Sorry, are you just telling me that someone named Victor Lustig had an 'interesting life'? 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.020
 Yes 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.080
 With such a name, is not that on the card? 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:08.600
 Oh, he has had many kinds of tickets printed. For many kinds of business. 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:09.760
 Was he a spy? 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 Ooh no. More to the dark side of those arts? 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.360
 Was he a night spy? 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.760
 --No - With Patrick Moore (English astronomer) 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.960
 Imitator? 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.800
 Imitator ... is not precise enough. 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.240
 I need something more laffer. 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.020
 Was he a bulky womanizer? 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.760
 Crook? 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:30.240
 Crook! [TING] Is exactly the word I was looking for! 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.140
 That is why he had the tickets for different identities 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.200
 Different identities, different jobs, 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.600
 he was one of the most successful scammers of all time 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.960
 wait a minute, is this the guest who sold the eiffel tower? 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.900
 [TING] [MISTERY BISCUITS!] 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.360
 OK, he won. 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.940
 We can all go home! 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:51.880
 He is therefore the guest who sold the Eiffel Tower 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.580
 you miss an important word at the end of your sentence 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.500
 Several times... 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:56.460
 Twice 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.540
 Yes, correctly, Victor Lustig is the man who sold the Eiffel Tower twice 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.900
 Is it worn at the bottom? 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.400
 is he worn .... you know, I'll give you a point 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.200
 go away.. 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.360
 I'm making a joke here 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.320
 go away! 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.980
 Sold! 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.360
 Lifting on one side ... nailing tightly, and polishing ... 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.320
 I mean what ... 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:25.240
 what kind of handle do you want on that Eiffel Tower? Are you going to run on ice? 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.220
 I'll give you a point [TING] 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.380
 In 1925 he was no longer used and ready for demolition 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.100
 He was built for ... 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.600
 It was something like the Millenium Dome, built as a temporary thing, part of an exhibition 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.820
 To show that the French could build a big penis to heaven 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.060
 because let's face it, that's what towers are ... I have a bigger one than you! 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.960
 It was a temporary thing, was not it? 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.060
 Everyone thought he would be taken away again to make room 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.560
 for the patisserie or something like that .. 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.340
 Yes, but if they would bring him down, what would they sell him for? 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.040
 Scrap! 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.960
 Blackpool! 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.020
 Get your blackpool parts here! 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.620
 the mayor of blackpool is on .. 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.900
 "It has come to my attention that there is a tower like ours. 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.880
 this tower has entered the market and I have been able to get it off the market for a reasonable price. " 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.420
 Does he have a ballroom? 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.140
 No, no ballroom or circus, unfortunately not at the top, which always disappoints me 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.920
 Because that seems hilarious to me 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.520
 I want to see an elephant walking around the top on top of a beach ball 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.040
 on a glass ball? 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.440
 Yes, that would be great fun! 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.980
 or a lift opens, and a mass of clowns comes out 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:35.260
 You are right, they would sell him as scrap 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.280
 How would you sell the Eiffel Tower? 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.640
 You approach someone very quietly, who is A) quite stupid and B) has a lot of money ... 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.660
 And you say ... 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:47.200
 ..how is his name ... Jones, looked at this ... And I think you want him .. 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.660
 You get another point Matt [TING], 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.700
 for he invited 6 scrap dealers to the same meeting, and said: 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:59.020
 I am from the French government, here is my ticket, and the paperwork 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.900
 Who wants to buy the Eiffel Tower? 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.320
 You do not want Michel to get him, you can buy it, you can become rich of it 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.000
 Michel the scrap dealer 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.440
 Some guest from Rotherham arrives with a car and says: 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.440
 "I can load it all for the lowest bid!" 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.100
 OK, give me a robust French name 

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:16.960
 Jaques 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.020
 Oh .... that's true 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.640
 F * CK 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.640
 He arranged a limousine for all 6 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.820
 and drove them around, and determined who was the most enthusiastic and gullible 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.360
 can anyone here gamble .. 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.960
 what was the name of the person he selected? And this is not as difficult as it seems 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:34.940
 Michel 

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.640
 Jaques 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:40.920
 André and the surname is a French word that you learn at school for .. 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.840
 Gare 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.760
 Bonjour 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.800
 Something you take with fries 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:45.840
 Frites 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:46.400
 Mule 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.200
 Cheval 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.560
 That's a horse 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.680
 Horse and French Fries 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.180
 Mhhh 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.280
 la Plage 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.420
 What? that's the beach 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.920
 That's where you eat them 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.560
 What the hell are you eating with fries !? 

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.580
 Piscine 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.620
 That is the wrong word! that's a swimming pool! 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.840
 poisson 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.840
 poisson [TING] 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.880
 André Poisson 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:13.060
 André Piscine 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.920
 Bonjour, your suis Andrew Swimming Pool 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.780
 Is it Gary? 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.480
 We killed him! 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:25.040
 Oh god, I want to order that! 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.020
 Le piscine! sil vous plait 

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:31.660
 Sorry France 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.040
 André Poisson 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.800
 so not André Piscine 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.340
 André Poisson did listen to it 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.800
 Someone in his area almost prevented the deal 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.780
 His wife!? 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.100
 [TING] Yes, Poissons wife 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.900
 thought it suspicious 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.700
 Smart, smart .. 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:49.840
 the deal was too fast and too secret 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.600
 The thing that caught her attention was the absence of the "For Sale" sign 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.020
 on the side of the Eiffel Tower 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.640
 Yes 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.080
 It was not on the news 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.580
 How does a scammer deal with being almost unmasked? 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.880
 By lighting her up 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.180
 By courting her [translation woo] 

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.460
 what, like a ghost? 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.940
 whooohooohooo 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:08.440
 Sorry! 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:09.660
 aha ... 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.500
 I am the spirit of Monsignor Eiffel, and I want you to buy my tower 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.320
 Did he tie her to the top? And he got big ... 

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.140
 and turns dots on his mustache ... 

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.180
 Let a train drive up the side .. 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.800
 Let a zeppelin slowly come closer. 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.140
 No? 

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:27.040
 Paid her? 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.300
 He admitted 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.940
 with a completely false statement .. 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:35.360
 that he was a Minister who tried to be bribed 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.520
 aaahhhh 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:38.480
 What did that mean for what he got 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:39.680
 A smaller part? 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.040
 More the opposite! 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:41.720
 A larger part? 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:43.700
 Here, a point [TING] 

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.900
 He got the money, 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.200
 What color is a red fire truck? 

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:52.880
 Lusty got the money for the eiffel tower, 

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:53.980
 and the kickback 

00:06:57.900 --> 00:06:59.320
 Good work, my lord 

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:03.520
 He took a train to Vienna with a suitcase full of money 

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.160
 That is the way to do it! 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.920
 in the France between the wars. How else? with a suitcase with money. 

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.460
 And you can leave the city without being seen 

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.980
 That is obviously the least striking way to pay someone 

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:21.000
 handing over a suitcase with millions of francs 

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.720
 Thank you, I step in this waiting train right next to me .. 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:27.700
 Here are the keys 

00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:28.580
 From my garage ... 

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:31.960
 from the tower, because towers have keys, remember that 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:32.460
 Yes 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.040
 And the floor plans are inside. dove! 

00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.020
 Light a cigar with a new money bill 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.240
 What happened next? 

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:44.840
 I think he arrived with the cutting torch, 

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.300
 and started at the foot ... and someone sent him away 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:48.660
 Euh, no, no 

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.060
 He checked it with the government? 

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:51.280
 Euhm ... maybe 

00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:55.100
 Does it sound like this is the type of man who would check that? 

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.340
 After he had already bought him without having to check before? 

00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:01.980
 all of a sudden .... Now it's time to .. 

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.180
 What would you do.. 

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:08.220
 If you are scammed for such a large sum of money? 

00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:11.640
 I would .. I do not admit that 

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:12.760
 one point [TING] 

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.440
 Nothing happened 

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:19.980
 Poisson was so humbled that he did not go to the police. 

00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:22.740
 That's kind of like going to the desk and saying: I'm a *** idiot 

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:23.240
 Yep! 

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:28.580
 This man approached me if I wanted to buy this large, well-known national building 

00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:30.480
 For a ridiculously low amount 

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:32.160
 do not ask questions! 

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:34.620
 He said, do not ask questions ... so I did not, 

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:36.440
 oh, and I gave him a bribe 

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:40.540
 Oh, yes, I gave him a pile of money and he got on a train, and he can be anywhere now! 

00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:42.320
 You have to do something about this! 

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.640
 Where was Lustig a month later? 

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:45.880
 Was he still in Paris? 

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:47.080
 To sell him again? 

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.720
 Both a point! [TING] [TING] 

00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.000
 You are right, he still had six scrap dealers in a room in Paris 

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.720
 And he did the same trick again 

00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.120
 He did not go for the "Hat Trick" right? 

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:00.600
 No, he could not do that anymore 

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.280
 He was robbed? He was caught? 

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:06.040
 Not really ... he managed to prevent arrest 

00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.520
 One of the traders found him and broke his knees? 

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.760
 One of the dealers ... One of them knew the other one. 

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.120
 No, I give this point to Chris [TING] A scrap merchant went to the police 

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.820
 with the false contract, and puzzled out what happened 

00:09:17.820 --> 00:09:19.680
 But Poisson managed to get out of the city and avoid arrest 

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.320
 mhhh, yes 

00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:24.340
 This is the story of the man who sold the Eiffel Tower twice 

00:09:24.340 --> 00:09:27.960
 But there are still a lot of scammers' tricks that he did 

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.280
 What was his "money printing machine" for example? 

00:09:30.280 --> 00:09:31.960
 A machine that could print money? 

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:32.640
 WRONG! 

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.460
 A person? 

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:36.320
 No, it is a machine 

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.000
 .. who did not print money 

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.180
 One point [TING] He printed very badly, and sold the machine to others 

00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:42.360
 who wanted to do this .. 

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.920
 All right, another point [TING] 

00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:45.020
 Ha! Totally correct. 

00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.420
 So he probably has a machine from which money came from 

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:50.100
 he then sold the machine and supplied a copier or something similar 

00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:51.100
 It was just a box 

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.580
 How long did this box cost 100 dollars? 

00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.620
 exactly as long as it takes for someone on the other side to push the note out? 

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:00.920
 You are .. A kind of Turing test 

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:04.200
 As long as it takes to leave the city? 

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:06.560
 As long as it takes to take the train to Vienna? Again. 

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.320
 You get the point, this time with a boat [TING] 

00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:13.140
 He went up and down with the Transatlantic ferries 

00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:17.980
 and while entering New York he gave .. 

00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:20.920
 a statement to someone that he had a money-making machine 

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.600
 and he printed a $ 100 note, but that took about 6 hours. 

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:27.780
 How? how can a machine need 6 hours to get a ... 

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:28.900
 because this was a long time ago 

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:31.160
 it is very difficult, the machine has to do everything 

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:35.120
 and, for 6 hours a $ 100 note came from the machine 

00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:36.980
 and then the beginning of the next 

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.320
 And he said: it takes so long, I really want to sell the machine. 

00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.580
 so it's actually two normal $ 100 tricks, is not it? 

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.840
 yeah, the machine spits two $ 100 notes, and then only blank paper by the time he's gone. 

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.800
 Oh, for God's sake, people ... 

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.540
 Oh, the ink is gone. I can also sell you 

00:10:54.540 --> 00:10:56.200
 Was his last name coincidentally Hewlett-Packard? 

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.220
 What, the printing ink? 

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:57.720
 Yes 

00:10:57.720 --> 00:11:00.340
 I also sell the ink for a ridiculously high amount 

00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:05.720
 There was also the "black dollar" scam. or money laundering 

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.080
 Does anyone know how that works? 

00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:08.920
 Is that something like invisible ink? 

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.440
 No, the opposite 

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.440
 Is it visible ink? 

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:15.880
 I keep giving points for obvious things 

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.340
 Was it invisible, this? 

00:11:17.340 --> 00:11:19.420
 yes, Matt, a point [TING], please 

00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.820
 I like that binary point system here. 

00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:26.740
 He simply drew up an Eiffel Tower somewhere and tried to sell it. 

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:31.720
 Oh ... did he try to use banknotes that had been invalidated by the bank or something? 

00:11:31.720 --> 00:11:37.980
 Yes, that is the [TING]. A suitcase full of dyed money. 

00:11:37.980 --> 00:11:38.480
 Yes, 

00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:44.820
 With the idea that he sells the chemicals to clean it for a fraction of the value. 

00:11:44.820 --> 00:11:49.100
 And he demonstrated that on the few hundred dollar bills that he sent in advance ... 

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.020
 had worked for these chemicals 

00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:52.200
 And then it works .. But the rest is .. 

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:56.080
 you have it all right [TING], just painted paper 

00:11:56.080 --> 00:11:59.560
 Or, they need more expensive chemicals. 

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.060
 Of course! 

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:01.820
 Again, just like printing 

00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:05.040
 At work, a while back, someone tried something similar, not as a scammer, but .. 

00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:10.460
 They lived abroad and wanted to pay for a number of services. So she sent us a copy .. 

00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:12.360
 of two £ 5 notes. 

00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:14.200
 As if that would work as a payment 

00:12:16.440 --> 00:12:18.600
 Is that scam? Or is that just ... 

00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:23.580
 If you could do that ... You would not need money, would you? 

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:25.960
 A fiver and .. 

00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.160
 I felt like sending back a drawing of 20 pence change 

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:37.360
 Yes, he was also a member of a scammer group that printed counterfeit money 

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.360
 that was a lot easier in the 1930s. 

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:44.760
 He was arrested by agents in 1935. Who linked him? 

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:47.160
 After all this operational safety. After all this ... 

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.720
 His wife! I just wanted to say, his wife. 

00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:49.960
 His mistress. [TING] 

00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:51.840
 Arrghhh! 

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:55.500
 Yes, his handling of romance was just like his scam. 

00:12:55.500 --> 00:13:00.640
 He had several women and one of them became jealous and betrayed him. 

00:13:00.640 --> 00:13:01.540
 Was she the Statue of Liberty? 

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.280
 He was immediately arrested. She opened his suitcase, and found? 

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:08.800
 Money!? 

00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.120
 No, expensive clothes. And a key. 

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.240
 The key fitted to a safe. She opened the safe and, what was in it? 

00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:15.580
 Money! Narnia! 

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.840
 Mr. Tumnus ... with money! 

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.800
 A fake Mr. Tumnus. 

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:25.760
 But if you wash him, he is actually two $ 100 notes in a box. 

00:13:27.980 --> 00:13:29.920
 No, you're absolutely right, fake money. [TING] 

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:35.100
 $ 51,000 false money, more than enough to convict him. 

00:13:35.100 --> 00:13:37.880
 Look, that's because you obviously do not have $ 51,000 bills. 

00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:40.380
 A note! 

00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:45.880
 "5, 1, 0, 0, 0 ..." 

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.940
 "I sell him for 50 backs, friend!" 

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:51.220
 Only he had notes of toilet paper 

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.820
 Stayed. taken to court, he known debt. What happened the day before his trial? 

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:57.420
 He fled? 

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.140
 Yes! He managed to escape. I wanted to say... 

00:13:59.140 --> 00:13:59.940
 A point [TING] 

00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.000
 It turned out that his confession ... was not real. 

00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:08.400
 They have washed the confession and after that there was "innocent". I am on the train to Vienna! 

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.280
 again! 

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:14.280
 And they said the man in the court was actually a photo on a piece of cardboard. 

00:14:14.280 --> 00:14:16.660
 That falls over at the end. 

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:18.840
 How did he do this ?! 

00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:22.140
 He managed to escape from the Federal House of Detention. 

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:24.520
 that Is either a prison or a ... Brothel! 

00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:26.020
 Yes, I thought a good nightclub 

00:14:26.020 --> 00:14:27.620
 Or a very strict school. 

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:32.280
 And he left the city. He took a train, presumably to Pittsburgh, 

00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.640
 and they grabbed him ... 

00:14:33.640 --> 00:14:34.540
 almost four weeks later. 

00:14:34.540 --> 00:14:35.480
 But, 

00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:39.800
 unfortunately it ends for him in Alcatraz, with pneumonia. 

00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.520
 But what ... Oh! 

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:43.520
 Was it really pneumonia? .. did he try to sell to the other prisoners? 

00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.480
 What was on his death certificate as his profession? 

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:48.680
 Was it just the dollar sign? 

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:49.320
 Git! 

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:50.440
 Banker? 

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.220
 You know what, I'll give you the point, It was a student salesman. 

00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:57.820
 Yes ... [TING] 

00:14:57.820 --> 00:14:59.100
 That's about it. 

00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:01.260
 Alternative: broker. 

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.320
 Striking! 

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.820
 So congratulations, Matt, you win this week 

00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:08.760
 Jee! 

00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:13.440
 Congratulations, you win a Formula One champion steel kettle. 

00:15:14.320 --> 00:15:16.080
 It is Sebastian Vettel's metal kettle. 

00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:20.080
 Good. I want tea! 

00:15:20.680 --> 00:15:22.700
 And with that we say thank you to Chris Joel, 

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:23.760
 Gary Brannan, 

00:15:23.760 --> 00:15:24.540
 Matt Gray, 

00:15:24.540 --> 00:15:26.420
 I was Tom Scott, until next time! [translation: Wouter Weggelaar]
