00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
 Last week I made a video about pedestrian crossings, 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.720
 and although I don't want this to become "things you may not know about British pedestrian crossings," 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.500
 Well, there is one more thing and a lot of people contacted me to say I should point it. 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:18.420
 There is a secret button, or button, at the bottom of these things you press when you want to cross the road. 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.840
 And what the little secret knob is, is a sign for people who are blind and deaf, 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.220
 or is partially blind and partially deaf. 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.820
 Or that is partially blind and at a pedestrian crossing that doesn't say a beep sound when it's safe to cross 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:31.940
 which is a surprising number of pedestrian crossings. 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.980
 Because the little knob rotates when the signal turns green, as we will now see. 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.840
 Because don't forget, disability is not a thing that turns on or off 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.060
 You not only have people who are completely blind, but fine every other way, or completely deaf, but in perfect condition to see. 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.700
 You have lots of people who might walk around safely in the world, but who can't see the light curve, 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.040
 and that could not separate the beep sound from the background noise, even if it is there. 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.240
 So the little knob means it's safe for a lot of British people to cross the road, 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.440
 And that's one thing you might not 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.440
 [laughing at the sound of a bus] 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.440
 Why do I record videos near roads? 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.320
 THAT is one thing you might not know! 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.020
