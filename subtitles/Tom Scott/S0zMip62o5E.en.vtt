00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.360
 Oh no, that is not good! That is not good! Boys anyway! 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.360
 Now you have it crashing. 

00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:10.580
 Oh my God! (laughter) That is so realistic. 

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:13.400
 I thought I would go over the edge. 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.040
 This is Mevea Simulation in Lappeenranta, in Finland, 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.720
 which make some of the most realistic industrial simulators in the world. 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.980
 These simulators can be used for training the operators 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.980
 or for research and development of the machine. 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.340
 You can test different types of designs of the machine. 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.940
 The seat and the controls are the same as in the real machine. 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.180
 The control system of the machine does not know that it is controlling a simulator. 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.680
 I just instinctively looked down to see what was there! 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.680
 Yes, you are trying to keep yourself alive! 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.480
 And the screens support 3D? 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.480
 That is not enabled today because of the cameras, 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.480
 but this system supports full 3D rendering and can also follow my head. 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.480
 Yes. That is possible if you wish. 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.560
 But it does not look like the other staff here. 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.860
 This is controlled by three computers. 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.960
 Intel i7, 3.5GHz, and a GTX 780 graphics card. 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.240
 The people from Mevea told me that they had a material handler simulator 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.900
 which I should definitely try. And then ... then ... 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.220
 ... they told me they had friends at a steel plant. 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.220
 And uh ... 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.240
 Tjah (!) 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.460
 - All right. - Sit down. 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.160
 - Turn the seat. - Yep. 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.160
 - I'll help you a little. - All right. 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.900
 Good. Now you are ready to start. 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.180
 The movements of the joystick - so, left, right ... 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.540
 Oh, that's weird! Oh, that's ... aah! 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.540
 That is much faster than I thought it would be. 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.840
 Okay then. 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.300
 The thing is, and this is very weird ... 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.120
 I did not think about that movement. That was just ... 

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:59.420
 it was clearly the right thing to do. 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.360
 Pull the right joystick towards you. 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.100
 - All right. Oh! That's fast. - Up and down. 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.920
 Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa. Whoa. All right. 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.920
 - Careful with that! - Yes. It is much... 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.280
 ... much stranger - Because, in a simulator 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.280
 so much seesaw would not be so disturbing. 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.960
 In real ... it is very disturbing. 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.060
 And now ... okay, you've understood. 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.380
 - And now, up ... - Up. 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.580
 Here we go. And in. 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.340
 All right. And now, grab? - Yes. 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.380
 Yes. And then... 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.480
 - Close it again. - I've got it. 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.360
 All right. 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.040
 Well, now raise it a bit more. 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.340
 - Go to the left? - Yes. 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:54.360
 This ... open. 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.960
 I'm okay. Yes. I spilled a bit of that. 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.540
 But it did not matter much! 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.080
 How does it look? Does that go into it? 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.080
 I think so, yes. 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.580
 That looks like it goes into it. 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.880
 - Calm down. - Quiet. Quiet. 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.540
 A bit more... 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.760
 - Well done. Then open it. - Letting go? - Yes. 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.380
 - All right! - Now again. 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.380
 Now again! 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.380
 Cool, is not it? 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.800
 Pfff ... I'll let you know when my heart is back below 200 beats per minute! 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.500
 Thank you to everyone at Mevea Simulation! 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.280
 If you want to know more about them, the details are now on the screen, 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:36.280
 including a link to their YouTube channel. 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.740
 Leave it there. - Letting go. - And then open. 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.020
 Well done! 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.800
