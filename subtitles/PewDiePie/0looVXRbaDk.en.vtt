00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 I'm going to fuss' 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.880
 I'm going to fuss' 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.360
 I'm going to fuss' 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.400
 I'm going to fuss' 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.600
 Genius must be stopped! 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.500
 It's time to stop everyone 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.500
 Genius, which is a site that, to my concern, is used to break down 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.420
 rap texts explaining the meaning of the song 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.440
 To give more depth to the artist 

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.500
 But now Genius has taken on new adventures 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.240
 * 9 year old voice * Hit or miss, I guess they never miss what? 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.260
 That frame is a slang meaning 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.300
 What 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.040
 You got a girlfriend, I bet he doesn't kiss ya 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.220
 mwah 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.060
 What does it mean then 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:50.420
 The joke here is that Robert doesn't want to kiss 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.440
 What 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.920
 We dont want to know the meaning behind this 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.020
 It's disgusting 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.120
 Reach now with Genius or rap genius or whatever you want to call it 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.080
 Instead of having respectable artists who deserve recognition 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.900
 They decided 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.660
 LET'S ADD Viners 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.420
 👏 👏 👏 👏 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.600
 Like Lele Pons and Gabbie Hanna 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:08.940
 And of course 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.400
 The Backpack kid 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.120
 So essentially going from 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.240
 Thaw 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.020
 I am fussin ' 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.320
 I am fussin ' 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.380
 I am fussin ' 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.240
 I am fussin ' 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:57.840
 What does he mean by that 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.800
 Finally i can understand what he means 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.440
 With "I be flossin" " 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.580
 There's just a ton of great memes from this guy 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.000
 They've clearly just given up 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.280
 he is HEEEEH haA 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.480
 I don't hate vegans, I don't even give a **** if you're vegan 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.580
 stop showing it down my ****** 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.520
 I dont care 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:22.000
 great what you're doing. Thank you for helping the cows 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.220
 stopping the ads and the ****** fruit flies and shit, thats great do that 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.240
 I'm really happy for you, keep doing it becuase 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.980
 I like animals 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.020
 But i also eat them 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.640
 ehhm .... soo 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.100
 Im kind or conflicted 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.160
 hehehe 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.880
 There's a ton of stuff to go through 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.080
 But why don't we start with the I am flossin 'song 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.820
 Just cuase 'we already brought it up, for convenience matters 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.900
 I am fussin ' 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:47.320
 What does he mean by that 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.380
 Flossin 'is the dance that took the world by storm on the internet 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.740
 * Ninja trying to hype the crowd * 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.880
 * It doesn't work at all * 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.760
 Flossin 'the dance that took the world by storm 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.820
 It just really came to mind 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.980
 I was just playing around in the mirror, playing music and in started dancing 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.100
 And then I started doing it and I was like 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.120
 WOW, it has a cool rythm to it 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.520
 so i just brought it to Instagram 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.880
 The dance, it just really came to mind 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.200
 You mean when you where browsing YouTube 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.540
 Don't lie to Floss kid 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.540
 Everyone knows the original was from 2014, huh 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.680
 You want me to do it again? 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.120
 "Yea" 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.120
 "Okay" 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.860
 THE DANCE, just really came to mind 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.160
 I don't know, it's just so random 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.360
 I don't understand 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.700
 I'm joking obviusly, I'm not saying he actually plagiarized it 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.640
 A lot of people are saying that he did 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.700
 But, obviously it's possible for two people to come up with the same dancemove 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.580
 I know, crazy to think about, right? 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.260
 I think that's why it's so funny to me 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.200
 Or, his parents or management are trying to copyright this dancemove 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:52.700
 That, its not even original 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.000
 Everywhere you go you will see the flossin 'dance 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.380
 NO really, come on now 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.000
 That's ... That's really hard 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:05.780
 It's hard isn't it 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.600
 Come on we gotta get it now 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.200
 The craziest place in the seen floss dance is probably in New York 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.460
 There was a Guinness Book of the World thing they were doing for the amount of people flossin 'at one hour 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:23.240
 And it was just 600 000 people. And they didn't invite me but it's okay:) 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.700
 wait a 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.760
 wait a minute. wait a minute, sorry but 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.280
 did he just say that 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.820
 600,000 people tried to do something in New York City 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:41.060
 And this was recorded before Ninjas 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.040
 Now it all makes sense, it doesn't 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.940
 It says that they are trying to get a million people to the floss in New York City 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:52.080
 So we're going to get a million people right now to dance in Times Square 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.240
 * Pewds screaming * OHHHHHH 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.500
 So they're trying to beat the floss record 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.460
 hahhaha ha 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:59.900
 But no one did it 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.040
 Imagine trying to break a world record by trying to get a million people to do something 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.220
 This just brings whole meaning to this whole thing 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:08.340
 Thats amazing! 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.860
 BUT NO ONE DID IT 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.860
 * Ninja hyping crowd once again * 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.000
 Now I'm .... Now I get it 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.180
 This is how bad ideas come to mind 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.840
 When you try and steal some other people's idea that doesn't make sense 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.260
 Just like the dance 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.100
 I'm just kidding 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.260
 I'm being harsh on this kid, I mean like 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:28.640
 It's a cool dance, I'm not saying it didn't come up with it 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.760
 I want to go to Paris, I want to see the Eiffel Tower. That's great CONTENT 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:36.560
 Perfect example of why I love Genius 

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.760
 The way I love Genius 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:42.800
 I wanna go to France 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:43.500
 I want to see the Eiffel Tower 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.080
 Why did you write this thing, what was the deeper meaning behind it? 

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:48.220
 I want to go to France 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.180
 Thats great content 

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:54.420
 * pewds * okay 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.420
 * pewds * staph 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.480
 Oh good, please stop, please stop, stop, STOP, STAPH IT, ENOUGH 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.440
 * Explosions * 

00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:03.300
 Alright, so the first thing you want for you is. Spread your legs 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:05.240
 And then you're gonna put your arms out 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.760
 * pewds * and go left right, go left right 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:08.000
 left to right 

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.520
 INCREDIBLE everyone 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.520
 What motivated you and your mum to sue 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:18.400
 Ehmm, It was really my mum and my management that got the lawsuit 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.220
 Im kind of just a kid, having fun in life 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.080
 Im just letting the adults do all the busy work 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:28.120
 I don't really know the law like that I really can't say if they are taking advantage of anything or anything like that 

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:31.880
 But like, from a standpoint, like a manager standpoint. 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:33.540
 They think they're taking advantage of me 

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:36.080
 Luckily you can sue anyone, just go ahead 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.480
 Just go ahead, please don't sue me tho 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:42.500
 This is one reason no one floss during Ninjas gahaHAHA 

00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:44.720
 They just didn't want to get copyrighted 

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:47.620
 I'm not falling for that, I'm not doing the floss. That's copyright 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.720
 I know this is kind of a dead meme 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.920
 The whole, maybe I'm the monster 

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:04.920
 So goddamn good 

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:08.060
 Literally sounds like the beginning of a shit American idol audition 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:11.040
 * pewds laughing * 

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:13.020
 It's funny, cause it's true 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:18.780
 Really don't know what I'm made of 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.060
 Really they don't know 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:27.240
 So that line "people want to talk when I'm not around to hear" 

00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.380
 Means a few things 

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:29.860
 One is obviously like gossip and rumors 

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:38.580
 * Gabbie talking about herself * 

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.700
 Shut the fack up 

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:44.340
 People wanna talk when I'm not around to hear Really, they don't know what I'm made of 

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.140
 How much meaning you can get into this 

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.380
 I'm tougher than you think 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.440
 But also, it was supposed to be a deeper meaning on DNA 

00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:52.300
 What DNA are you talking about? 

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.440
 I don't want to be much on Gabbie, I mean everyone has been really mean in the comments going like 

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:00.920
 Ah, she can't sing blah blah blah 

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:05.300
 I mean lets be real here, so many artists can't sing and that hasn't stopped anyone 

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.880
 So keep doing what you're doing gabbie 

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:08.560
 Cauuse 'the memes are great 

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:10.380
 I listen to music that I feel is vulnerable 

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:11.380
 REALLY ?! 

00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:12.300
 really! 

00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:14.640
 Jacob Sartorius has a genius 

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:15.700
 WHY 

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:18.840
 STOP 

00:08:18.840 --> 00:08:20.700
 Oh my god, what the ftst is that 

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:21.480
 They just give up 

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.980
 They've just completely given up haven't they? 

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.920
 These are old, it's four days before the flossin 'one 

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:29.760
 Alright, let's see what he has to say 

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:32.320
 You actually have saved me with this song. 

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.300
 There is nothing that beats that 

00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:34.680
 Oh good, this argument 

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:40.380
 alright, yeah yeah yeah like if at least one person got this song and said it saved their life 

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.400
 That has brought meaning to my work 

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:46.680
 Like, imagine being 50 and you're being and adult in the future 

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.680
 I'm a survivor 

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.940
 Oh you survived the camps? 

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:53.000
 No, but Jacob Sartorius saved me 

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:55.820
 Jacob Sartorius saved my life 

00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:00.400
 Thank you Jacob, your musically got me really inspired 

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.120
 Me and my managers are in LA and we go and eat food everyday 

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:15.400
 And I'm so used to the same thing where the waiters are like "okay what can you get?" 

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.320
 They're not happy with their job 

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:19.640
 I mean it's a job and you know people gotta work 

00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:22.320
 But at the same time, you should be happy with what you're doing 

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.640
 It's nice to know that people care about you sometimes their waiter and you can be okay with that 

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.940
 what the fuck are you saying 

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:35.620
 I'm more confused now when he explained it 

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:37.720
 These must be some really advanced lyrics 

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.900
 For the record you have to have advanced lyrics 

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.440
 But if you go on Genius 

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:44.740
 Then maybe you want something to say but what is this 

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:46.040
 You ordered a coke 

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:52.080
 But you ordered the coke ... You ordered the coke 

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:52.740
 Is that what you mean 

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.000
 How did you ... aaahhh 

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:56.100
 There was a thing about that you should love your job like 

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:59.340
 Every waiter is supposed to be happy he's serving me coke 

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:05.920
 Not everyone can make a living from musically videos and horny tweens 

00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:07.080
 Jesus Christ dude 

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:12.900
 If you want to worry about your health then maybe your management that you eat lunch with everyday 

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:14.600
 Like, I don't get it, maybe I don't get it 

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:16.380
 Maybe his stuff is to advanced for me 

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:33.220
 what the hell happened 

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:34.740
 just give up 

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.200
 I can't keep ripping into this kids alright I get it 

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:49.520
 I don't wanna be bully 

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:53.040
 Jacob do whatever you want, alright I'm not trying to stop you. Live your life 

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.860
 Be free man, order as many coke as you want 

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.860
 Don't let anyone hold you back 

00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.760
 Maybe coke zero, now you look like a skinny boy you can probably drink regular coke 

00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.120
 * Ance * 

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.360
 Lele Pons 

00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:09.720
 When Lele Pons was on Genius I knew it was over 

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:12.700
 and I get that you have to understand that this video comes from 

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:13.940
 A place of 

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:15.240
 DISAPPOINTMENT 

00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:17.980
 I really like thissss, I really like Genius 

00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:23.180
 I really enjoy watching different artists and rappers explain their lyrics 

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:25.180
 I don't like Lele Pons (she's latina tax) 

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:26.440
 hey look there's my comment 

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.120
 Large yikes 

00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.080
 How did we get here 

00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:39.700
 HUH! 

00:11:40.660 --> 00:11:42.640
 I wonder what Lele is doing, you know 

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:44.880
 Clearly you do not have to advertise this series 

00:11:45.240 --> 00:11:47.280
 Art is here, I wouldn't like that either 

00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:51.740
 It would just be annoying, we need a bit of contrast in there and i respect Genius for doing that 

00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:52.780
 But friends 

00:11:53.220 --> 00:11:56.460
 Please for the love of good stop giving viners a platform 

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:00.100
 Now let's say there are tons of great friends on this platform 

00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.700
 Like Drew Gordon, he has great videos 

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:06.400
 Danny Gonzales, all I'm saying here is actually talented, funny and smart people 

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.980
 That came from wines 

00:12:07.980 --> 00:12:09.840
 But its the desperation that really gets me 

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.940
 It's that clawing for relevancy that's just so gross to me 

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:18.340
 They always crawl their way into the corporate world somewhere 

00:12:18.340 --> 00:12:21.820
 Just a little * someone * I don't generally hate her but the desperation 

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:23.220
 just disgusts me 

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.440
 And it's so transparent with these guys 

00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.420
 It's just sickening, I don't like it. I don't want to see it 

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:31.780
 That's what I mean. I just don't wanna see them 

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:35.560
 And I can't help them crawling there way into my territory 

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.460
 My Genius reviews, okay? 

00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:38.720
 just stop 

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:44.520
 So let me just end up at reviewing some of my favorite genius reviews that are actually funny 

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.260
 We have Big Chef for example 

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:50.300
 Now that's genius 

00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.460
 hahahaha, that's great 

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:05.480
 My absolute favorite one has to be the Lil Yacht 

00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:07.200
 Peekabo 

00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:18.420
 ** not understand ** 

00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.840
 The man did not just make that sound 

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.080
 ** still got no idea what he's saying ** 

00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:35.560
 If anyone can transcribe that to me, please cause 'I have no idea what he just said 

00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:37.300
 You need to really pay attention 

00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:40.480
 Which is why it's so important to listen to this 

00:13:40.660 --> 00:13:43.260
 Now the best breakdown of lyrics of all time is coming right up 

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:52.240
 ** still got no idea what he says ** 

00:13:53.980 --> 00:13:57.340
 I guess for a second in thought a cello was a woodwind instrument and it is not 

00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:02.660
 I guess for a second 

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.020
 That's why you wrote a whole song about it 

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:08.340
 That's why it's in a song, just for a second 

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.840
 You thought a cello 

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:12.120
 was a blowing instrument 

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:13.880
 I'm so happy that's in a song 

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:14.720
 Just for a second 

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.820
 I just ... I ... It just happened for a second guys 

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:19.360
 It was an honest mistake 

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:23.800
 And instead of saying I made a mistake I'm just gonna go ahead and blame my manager 

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:27.440
 Or whoever produced the song because they didn't know either 

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:27.940
 Okay 

00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.980
 He thought Squidward played the cello 

00:14:36.020 --> 00:14:37.600
 Squidward plaed the CLARINET 

00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:38.960
 You're a musician 

00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:40.880
 Okay 

00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:43.140
 Hope you guys enjoyed this genius and rap 

00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.320
 I keep calling it rap genius, It's clearly not what it is 

00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:49.300
 VINER genius, that right. That's a thing apparently 

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:52.000
 Hope you guys enjoyed, you'd really appreciate it 

00:14:52.520 --> 00:14:56.680

 I also wanna give a quick shoutout 

00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.900
 To my husband 

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:22.980
 CJ PLAYS 

00:15:23.200 --> 00:15:23.700
 Okay? 

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:26.020
 he makes incredible videos 

00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.680
 I review one of his videos before 

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:37.480
 Apparently he's been a little scared of making more video 

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:39.500
 so I just wanted to hope that CJ 

00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:42.020
 get encouraged to make more videos 

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.120
 I genuinely think that they bring a lot of joy to people like that 

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:46.320
 eh 

00:15:46.580 --> 00:15:48.260
 shoutout to ma man CJ 

00:15:48.260 --> 00:15:49.320
 and I hope he keep uploading 

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.720
 That's it for me for now 

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:52.000
 See you next time 

00:15:52.300 --> 00:15:53.020
