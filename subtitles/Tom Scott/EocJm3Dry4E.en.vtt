00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.020
I'm not allowed to cross this road,

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:04.500
because this is the town
of Stanstead, Canada.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.060
On the other side of the
street is Derby Line, USA

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:11.040
and the border between the
two countries runs right down this:

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.440
Rue Canusa.

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.120
For local residents,
that can be inconvenient.

00:00:16.123 --> 00:00:18.900
- I've lived here all
my life, so 63 years.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.200
Today you cannot cross over the line
and visit your neighbours, like years ago.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.650
If you want to cross,
you have to report at customs.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.440
You know I used to cross every day,
but now

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.460
I probably cross once every...
about once a week

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.020
because I come down to
the post office over here.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.720
To go through the border, basically,
they ask you for your passport,

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.130
they go inside, I guess they look at
whether you have a record or not.

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.230
They'll look at your
registration of your car

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.240
and a couple of minutes
and you've gone through.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.977
I'm a dual citizen so I'm
American and Canadian.

00:00:46.977 --> 00:00:49.510
So it's easier.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.560
- This is a place where
the idea of a border

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.670
as a solid, easy to understand line
gets a little bit fuzzy.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.350
The road doesn't run at exactly the same
angle as the border, not precisely.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.520
The official line is that
this is Canada and that's the USA,

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.100
but both countries' maps show the road
as being entirely in the US just here

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.090
and entirely in Canada, up there.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.180
The houses are definitely
in separate countries

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.900
but the road is not quite as clear.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.600
And in practise, if I was driving I'd be okay. 
Even on that side of the road,

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.850
I am considered to be still in Canada,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.220
as long as I don't stop and
walk up to an American house.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.060
It's fair to say that there's
a little bit of leniency here,

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.170
if you're just nudging the
border by a few centimetres.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.160
Or if you're on that side,
a couple of inches.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.100
But while I was setting up my camera here,
the police turned up, lights flashing,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.740
to move along those bikers
you saw earlier

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.500
who were admiring the view
from the other side of the road.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.290
It all seemed in good spirits,
but they had crossed the border.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.755
- Well, the library is
part on the Canadian side

00:01:47.755 --> 00:01:49.210
and part on the American side.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.960
But you stay on the Canadian side
and you stay on the sidewalk,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.120
and you go through the front door
and it's permitted.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.280
On Canusa Street, there's
a sidewalk on the Canadian side,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.540
so back years ago, it was tolerated
that people on the American side

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.960
could cross over and walk on the sidewalk,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.700
so, basically it's dangerous to
walk on the side of the road

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.180
and now today, well,
it's not tolerated no more.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.370
I think the rule hasn't changed much,
but they're more enforced.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.240
When you cross, they ask you more questions
than they used to, you know, years ago.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:23.330
Before when you went through the border,
you knew most of the customs officers

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.480
and they used to wave to you, y'know.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.530
- In 1783, this section of
the Canada-US border was set

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:33.190
at the 45th parallel,
a line of latitude.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:38.470
Slightly inaccurate measurements were accepted
by both countries, so it was locked in.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.730
But as for this specific road?

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.990
There are local stories about
drunk surveyors and pranks,

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.053
but no one really knows.
