00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.280
 This is the Notre-Dame in Paris, 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.280
 one of the most famous sights in the city. 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:06.120
 But I'm not here for the view from the top 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.820
 or for the flying buttresses and not even for religion. 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.940
 I am here for something just outside. 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.140
 If you look down from the top just outside the main entrance, 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.320
 you will find a marker on the ground 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.320
 called: "Point Zero". 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.680
 "Point Zero" is the place where all distances 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.300
 measured in France. 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.140
 At the moment I am filming here 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.340
 because once a person starts filming, 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.760
 it attracts tourists in the same way as 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.200
 traditional French bread attracts pigeons. 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.580
 That is a visual metaphor for you. 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.900
 France is not the only country with a "Point Zero"; 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.020
 many countries in the developed world have one. 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.800
 There will be a marker or a monument somewhere in the capital 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.460
 that says "this is where the numbering starts". 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:45.660
 In the United Kingdom, however ... 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.180
 ... uh, no, we do not have one, nor the US 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.120
 I mean, the United Kingdom has Charing Cross in London, 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.480
 but a few roads have been measured here. 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.500
 And in the United States, well, you have a marker in Washington, DC, 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.840
 But yes, nobody uses it for anything. 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.260
 Most states in the United States restart numbering as soon as a road enters their territory. 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.380
 And, here in Paris, a marker has hardly ever been used 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.440
 in these days of GPS and satellites. 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.820
 But what you have is a relic of a past tense, 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.540
 a marker that simply says "this is where we started". 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.480
 This is back to the time that we already had the triangulation 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.580
 and manual calculations were needed to map out something, 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.880
 back to when it was handwritten. 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.720
 This is where it all started. 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.780
 That is "Point Zero" and that is something you may not have known. 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.080
