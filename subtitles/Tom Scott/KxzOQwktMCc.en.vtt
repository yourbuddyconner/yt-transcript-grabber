 If you are in certain parts of the world, this video will not report anything new. But all 

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.310
 others: Welcome to Wales, and what might be the strangest bridge you've ever seen. 

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:15.040
 This is the Newport Transport Bridge, one of only a handful of transport bridges still in place 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.310
 active. And you will notice something strange when you stand on the ground. 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.580
 There is not a lot of bridge deck to see. At the top there is one for maintenance and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.560
 to use frightened tourists, but there is no through road. Instead there is one 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.140
 type of air ferry: There is a bridge section that goes back and forth, 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.420
 connected by huge cables here at the top. 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.729
 That raises a question: Why not a ferry? Well, the Usk River, here, is part of it 

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:47.440
 the river mouth of the Severn, which has one of the biggest time differences in the world. So low 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.149
 that it is for the most part a mud flat. A normal ferry would not come close to the bank. 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.139
 But instead a bridge with a few very difficult design requirements. 

00:00:55.139 --> 00:01:00.129
 First of all, the ships that sailed here a hundred years ago, when the bridge was built, were huge, 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.000
 so the bridge had to be at least as high. But the bank is low, so enough 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.469
 To gain height with a normal bridge, it must be kilometers long. What a lot 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.180
 more expensive, mostly a century ago, and you could also be a big part of Newport 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.700
 must break off. 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.600
 You could use a swing bridge or lift, but they would need a solid surface 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.810
 in the middle of the deep, wild river. Expensive. In addition, the fast and dangerous currents here 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.649
 would mean that ships would have great difficulty not to hit the bridge. 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.270
 So you can not use a bridge, you can not use a ferry, but you can. 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.960
 It is a strange combination, a hundred years old - and that hundred years is the reason why 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.039
 they are no longer being built. Because in those hundred years technology has made great strides. 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:44.320
 First, we can dig through long, deep tunnels under the river, instead of going over it, and 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.159
 we should not worry about breaking things down. Second, we have cars and 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.749
 buses, no horse and cart. The detour of seven kilometers that this bridge prevented is by no means 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:02:00.200
 such a big problem: You just drive around it. But nevertheless this bridge 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.960
 an icon for Newport, for Wales. It is a tourist trajectory, for very self-confident tourists. 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.800
 And the toll is only a pound. So this bridge will still stand for a century or two.
