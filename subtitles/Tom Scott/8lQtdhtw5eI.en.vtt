00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.670
 You rarely see the gravestone on which the repair is. 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.580
 But you rarely find such a strange story as this one. 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.230
 I'm just a short walk from Huelva, in southern Spain 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:14.749
 and near there is the grave of a Man who has never been. 

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:17.320
 In 1943, when the Second World War was raging 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.730
 found the body of Major William Martin serving at the British Navy 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.020
 as he sails on the water of the coast. 

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.580
 A suitcase was attached to his body and there was a letter with details 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.720
 on the planned allied attack on Greece across the Mediterranean Sea. 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.090
 There was no "here our secret plans here", but almost. 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.860
 It was a friendly letter among the generals in which 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.880
 there were all the necessary details. 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:41.400
 The British Security Service was desperately trying to get it 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.130
 the briefcase back before German spies, 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.290
 but it was too late. 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.100
 Britain has gotten its documents back, 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.970
 but before that their copy was already on the way to Hitler. 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:54.120
 He then sent a large number of soldiers, tanks and ships to Greece, 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.620
 to avert the British attack. 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.740
 Hitler had to be quite surprised, 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.800
 when allies invaded Sicily, 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.920
 near the southern coast of Italy, instead of Greece. 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.970
 And they won, with a fraction of the losses they could suffer. 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.750
 Major William Martin never existed. 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.750
 He was fictional. 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.690
 But there was a man named Glyndwr Michael. 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.750
 It was Welsh living in London during the Second World War. 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.290
 He had no home or money or friends. 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.400
 He died in the street after he poisoned the poison in the meal, 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.940
 maybe deliberately, maybe out of despair, he ate the remnants of rat poisoned food. 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.230
 We will never know. 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:28.380
 According to official records, 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.580
 his body was "relocated outside England" and that is actually true. 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.659
 His body had been in the morgue for some time, 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:38.830
 then dressed him in the right uniform and added carefully falsified personal documents. 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.390
 There was an account for a wedding ring, a love letter from the fiancee and her photo, 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.950
 bus card, keys and other papers. 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:49.890
 Then they loaded the body into a submarine that had reached the Spanish coast. 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.590
 And during a dark night in April 1943, the crew let the body into the water 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.450
 and let it drift by the stream. 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.619
 The action was called, somewhat terrible, "Operation Mackerel". 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.590
 The British Security Service has chosen the place correctly. 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:03.840
 There were a lot of German spies in Spain, 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.283
 and the head of Spanish security was the kind of man, 

00:02:06.283 --> 00:02:08.000
 which would declare the appearance of the body as its own 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.159
 and then went to Berlin to hand over the copies personally 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.689
 and maybe even somewhat embraced the story of his finding, 

00:02:14.689 --> 00:02:18.780
 to make it look better and to make the story look a little more credible. 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:19.780
 And he did exactly that. 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.760
 And, of course, the desperate attempt of the British to save the documents was just an eye. 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.290
 In 1943, the team from Bletchley Park deciphered the Enigma code 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.709
 and he could listen to the German news 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.439
 less than a month after Glyndrew's body was launched. 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:39.549
 They caught a message confirming that the plan had come out perfectly. 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.109
 Britain took Sicily, used it as a bridgehead to get to Italy 

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:45.689
 and German war plans were in ruins. 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:51.269
 Even then, Major Martin, was buried with all the military honors and gravestones. 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:52.560
 The truth was still strictly secret. 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.779
 His true identity was revealed in decades 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:59.799
 and therefore his grave was repaired. 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:03.109
 Glyndwr Michael, served as Major William Martin. 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:03.779
 Rest in peace.
