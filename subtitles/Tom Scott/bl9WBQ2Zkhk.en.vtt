00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.100
 You know from the experiment we did with Toast ... 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.140
 -- Oh yeah. - Ah, no! 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:12.140
 Have you recently received strange phone calls? 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.340
 - No. - Oh. 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.340
 Okay, we have to explain this: 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.200
 We have done a small experiment to find out what is the best 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.660
 Mannier is for Toast, probably the most attractive bachelor among us, 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.020
 to arrange a date. Or, sex. Or ... yeah. Thanks (!) 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.000
 We have tried it in several ways. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.860
 We first placed an advertisement on a certain well-known dating site. 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.140
 - I hate you. 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.380
 - with your telephone number. - I hate you so much at the moment. 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.180
 "Call Toast for a good time." 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.720
 - There are two things on that ad. 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.280
 There will certainly be time and I am maybe 24. 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:00.660
 - What I like so much is the bottom ad: "Is there someone who wants a suede?" 

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.900
 Now the question is whether that description is "gone wrong" or a person who loves an enormous amount of velvety material? 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.220
 - I think we should look a bit more at the ... There it is: "Single, athletic, easy-going person. 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.580
 - Oh, it's funny because it's true (!) 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.260
 And underneath is your telephone number. That is posted in October. Strange phone calls? Uberhaupt? 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.260
 - No, only yours. --Oh 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.840
 - And mine. 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.840
 - That is, considering you do not drink, remarkable. 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.920
 - We know that that was not such a successful approach. 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.500
 We had a second way, I believe it can be seen now, that was this ... 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.140
 placard that we hung up in a number of telephone booths in London. 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:44.200
 - Oh, that is beautiful. I want to keep it. The pink contour lines complete it. 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.480
 That makes it suitable for a kind of clientele, but that is really suitable for it. 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.860
 They are telephone booths in London - You can not get far ... 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.860
 - May I say something ... - It depends on how you sit ... 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.900
 - Well, you can, Gary, but I did not know you were thinking about me (!) 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.240
 - I did not realize we were doing this for the show and I called that number - it was occupied. 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.600
 - You too, you did not have to call that number at all. 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.560
 - Okay, no strange phone calls? - No strange phone calls. 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.000
 - Okay, we had a third attempt in case ... 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.880
 There was only one thing we could do and that was to go to Cardiff. 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.120
 That is Cardiff, the capital of Wales 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:23.180
 - That's the busiest shopping street in Cardiff ... - That's a river! 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.080
 And see there: There on a huge animated screen is Toast's face and phone number. 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.240
 That stopped ... 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.660
 - It does not state what it is for! "Buy this t-shirt!" 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.180
 -- All night! - "Grow a beard!" 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.280
 - These are not special effects, that really stood out. That was indeed there. 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.540
 - We paid for it. 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.200
 - We had to go through the entire bureaucracy of Cardiff ... 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.980
 - "Call Toast for a good time" was also rejected. 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.900
 - For the sake of clarity: That went through a whole city council before that sign was there. 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.400
 - Oh God, and I did not even get a call from their (!) 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.380
 You would think that there is some lonely woman there. 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.660
 - Phone calls? -- No! 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.160
 It does not matter in which format you advertise it - No phone calls. 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.480
 - We had to pay to use that board and it did not help at all. 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.480
 - Oh, of course, "help me" (!)
