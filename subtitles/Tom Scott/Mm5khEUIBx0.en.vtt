00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.560
 Here, below London, 32 km of new tunnels are almost completed. 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.660
 But they are not for people, but for electricity. 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.049
 The 400,000-volt voltages will be transmitted here, 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:13.549
 fueling a growing city 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.550
 which requires more and more electricity. 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:19.670
 This project stood a billion pounds, 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:20.810
 so that the lights could light up. 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.000
 How did we get to this? 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.720
 In the 1920's, electricity was created by hundreds of small businesses 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.769
 in places and cities across the United Kingdom. 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.630
 Everyone was different and mostly incompatible: 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.470
 Only London had 24 different voltages and 10 different frequencies. 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.760
 So if you moved to the adjacent street 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.010
 maybe you had to buy all the new bulbs. 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.550
 Under the condition that you had bulbs. 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.240
 Electricity prices were too high for almost everyone. 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.710
 The solution could have been what other European countries did: 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.900
 adopt and apply standards, regulate prices, 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.030
 perhaps nationalize companies that have engaged in electricity production. 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.770
 And lower the price to everyone, 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.620
 people and companies. A good plan in theory, 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.750
 but the problem was that the prime minister was then Stanley Baldwin, 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.110
 who led a conservative party. Political 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.740
 he could not control private corporations! 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.870
 That would be socialist. 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.470
 That's what the other side was doing. 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.750
 That is why the solution was a very British compromise: 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.430
 National Gridiron, later only National Grid. 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.340
 The Central Committee for Electricity, 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.000
 backed by the government and privately managed, 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.270
 built and owned the central infrastructure. 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.130
 He built a network of power lines across the country. 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.590
 The network has reduced the risk for small power companies 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.890
 and enabled them to access a much larger market. 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.890
 If they wanted to connect and reach out to everyone, 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.840
 they had to reach the Network Frequency Standards, 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.900
 voltage and reliability. 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.180
 The best story I found while researching this: 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.150
 Initially there were six different network areas 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.630
 spread across the country and managed separately. 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.260
 Their managers thought it was too risky 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.210
 connect them all together to one state network. 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.430
 But theoretically it was possible. 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.749
 Sometimes two or even three areas were merged together 

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:13.499
 to help maintain a network if somewhere a power plant was shut down. 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:19.040
 So on the night of October 29, 1937, engineers in control rooms 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.920
 without permission quietly decided 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.969
 Connect the whole country to one network for an hour or two 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:26.150
 to see what's going to happen. 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.139
 And the Network worked. One year later 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.230
 even the managers agreed that it was the only way 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.499
 to ensure that the lights are always bright everywhere. 

00:02:33.499 --> 00:02:36.129
 How is the level of regulation? 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:37.389
 and privatization 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:38.870
 changed over the years, 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.180
 as in nearly every other country in the world, 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.810
 and when technology has developed to the point 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.019
 instead of the power line 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:51.499
 now we are building a billion pound of 60 meter tunnels under London 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.109
 and we still have a majority private network today. 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.359
 Home on the London Stock Exchange. 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:02:59.379
 If history had been different, 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.809
 maybe this tunnel might have been a government today, 

00:03:01.809 --> 00:03:03.579
 but even if it is, 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:06.730
 we should still network to have light. 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.579
 Thank you very much for the National Grid 

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.680
 and all the people who allowed me to walk through the tunnels, 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.409
 together with Geoff from London, 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.969
 who have themselves made a video about these tunnels 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:17.599
 and my infrastructure around me. 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:18.790
 See this channel too!
