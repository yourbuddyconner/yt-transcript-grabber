00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.860
 If you ask an English teacher to correct a task, then it is easy to count words. 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:08.080
 This is the number that appears when you click on "word count" in your writing program. 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.900
 In English, the word counting algorithm typically means that a word consists of series letters. 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.860
 Each series separated by other types of characters ... 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:17.200
 That's a word! 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.340
 It is nice enough when you want to check that a style has a fairly suitable length, 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.900
 but it will also count a lot of other things than words with - 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.089
 And it doesn't answer our basic questions - What is a word really? 

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:31.520
 First, it is the issue of importance. 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.329
 If you accept the definition of a word 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.440
 as some letters surrounded by spaces, 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.420
 then "xnopyt", "aaaaaajjjjjj" and "hrrkrkrkrwpfrbrbrbrblblblblblwhitoo'ap" 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.720
 also words, even if they are completely meaningless. 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.079
 You can't even expect dictionaries to define all "real words". 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.620
 There are lots of words that people use daily but that have not been included in dictionaries ... 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.640
 - okay, that word you probably don't use anymore in daily speech - 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.840
 - but they obviously have an impact. 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.700
 So, let's say a word is some sign surrounded by something else, 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.700
 which expresses a meaning. 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.000
 On paper it is not a bad definition. 

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.820
 I mean, it's not really a bad way to define English words when they're written down 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:14.720
 But language is not just about writing language. 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.290
 The definition - spacing around some letters - does not count contraction. 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.100
 In daily English speaking, there are many more contractions, 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.740
 than what you see in writing. 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.880
 Depending on your dialect, "I'd-a" is as good as "I would have", 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.220
 as in "I'd thought you'd known that". 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.740
 Are there 3 words? 2 words? Only 1? 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.140
 What about "I'm-a" as in "I'm-a let you finish". 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.900
 There are several different ways to spell that phrase 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.600
 and it replaces the 4 conventional words, "I am going to". 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.860
 But in fact there is also a reasonable argument that "I'm-a" is not a contraction, 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.780
 but that it is an independent word "imma". 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.460
 Either way, be careful not to count the actual number of words. 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.860
 And to make things much worse, the meaning and use of words change over time. 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.860
 "Today" used to be with hyphen: "to-day", and pass it in two words: "to day". 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:07.400
 When did it become one word rather than two? 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.500
 What about "first class"? Does it become one word if you use hyphens? 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.080
 You will find that people give two different answers: two-day is one word, first-class is two words. 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.040
 It is only when it comes to English. What about synthetic languages, 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.540
 where in extreme cases can one put together whole sentences in one long series of characters and sounds? 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.700
 Is it still just one word? 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.880
 And more important is the question: is it important? 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:41.620
 Word Counting is a handy tool to keep an eye on one's progress in major writing work 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.300
 no matter how you precisely define a word, 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:47.420
 then it is obviously a great achievement to write 50,000 consecutive words. 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.860
 But if you look more closely at the language as a system, 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.960
 so it makes more sense to ignore words, and rather look at morphems and phrases. 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.140
 Words are probably the most convenient way to divide English sentences, 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.300
 But linguists can't actually use it for so much. 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.280
 Incidentally, we also have the question that has not yet been answered: 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.940
 are the words of emoticons or emoji? 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.140
 They are symbols that express a meaning 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.800
 sometimes quite literally encircled by spaces, sometimes to modify a sentence. 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.920
 So if I had to finish a written version of this with a smiley, 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.920
 should it count as a word? 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.020
 :-)
