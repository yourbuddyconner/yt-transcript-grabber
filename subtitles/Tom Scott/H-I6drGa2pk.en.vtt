 Sometimes, when people say something is "secret," they mean that it is very unknown or hidden. But 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.419
 this is really a secret. 

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:12.269
 In the Second World War the United Kingdom had a problem: getting fuel from the refineries to the airports 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.800
 that spread across the country. Above ground transport of fuel was too fragile for well-placed 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.980
 bombing of the road network. It was not the tankers themselves that were targeted, but the roads 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.490
 that were used. The solution: a huge, secret, underground tube 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.650
 network to transport kerosene through the country. It was even built at night so that the hostile 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.430
 reconnaissance aircraft would not be able to see what was happening. 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.460
 In the decades that followed, this network has been extended and expanded and extended to 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.720
 2400 kilometers of pipelines, which are ports, airports, refineries and 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.370
 Air Force bases throughout the UK. It is vital for both military and civilian use: if you 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.790
 plane is replenished at any known British airfield that comes fuel from tanks that 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.059
 connected to this pipe system. 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.079
 Airports in other countries have similar systems, but these are smaller, private agreements. 

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:08.630
 This was a big, secret government network - in fact, until it was sold and privatized 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.020
 in recent years, the air force regularly flew over most of the network 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.479
 See if everything was okay. 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.759
 The pipe system is now known to the general public because, well, it is difficult something like that 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.090
 great as to keep this secret. You can view a schedule, such as a vague metro map, and 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.280
 there are a few well-documented places like here in the Gloucester area, where it comes above ground 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.109
 for a few meters. But there is no public card that shows exactly where the pipes are. In 

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:37.749
 In 2010, the government refused to respond to a request under the Government Information Act that asked for the card, under the 

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:42.240
 mom that it would jeopardize national security and resilience. And, to be honest, that would do it. 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.459
 But at the same time: a local person might need to know where a pipe is, just 

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:51.899
 so that a construction worker does not simply break a pipe with his drill bit, and under high pressure 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.060
 spray very flammable kerosene, and ensure that Heathrow Airport is stationary for a day. 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.770
 That is why all pipes have these markers above them at regular intervals - sometimes 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.409
 the small ones like in the background, but often these are gigantic poles. Many people see 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.179
 they just like some street furniture, if they are noticed at all, but for professionals 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.750
 looking around, ready to dig, that's a big warning sign that you, maybe, 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.099
 just have to verify what exactly is under the ground here. 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.980
 In theory, someone could use modern air and street photography, work out the routes 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.879
 and just publish them - and there are enthusiasts who have done that for their field. But you 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:31.400
 there will be no official confirmation of it, because for once, this pipe system 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.370
 is really secret.
