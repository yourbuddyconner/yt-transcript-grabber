00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.340
 welcome! 

00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:03.100
 Craft video! 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.640
 That's right, Edgar. We are doing craft videos. 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.640
 * Push away Edgar* ... but not for you, Edgar, go away 

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.640
 Go away, Edgar 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.100
 This is not your movie! 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.080
 * stalking * 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:15.580
 Hey, Doggy ("dog" means? pewds are called small creatures between the legs, not maya) 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.820
 Hey, we have Doggy (not sure if the spelling is doggy or what...the room?) We have raised him for a while, but never let him expose it on my channel. 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:22.800
 He is a hedgehog 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.780
 Obviously we have a hedgehog. He runs very fast 

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.000
 As you can see (not as fast as Sonic) 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.440
 But do you know what I am thinking? 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.680
 Even faster! 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.080
 Obviously, Doggy needs... 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.720
 Sonic classic shoes 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.800
 I didn't know what to shoot today, but Marzia said, "Why don't you do small crafts?" 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.600
 So today we will come to Doggy. 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.840
 First, do Sonic's shoes... 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.040
 We need red felt 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.900
 Thicker, used to make soles 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.300
 There are also yellow and white. If you want to be crazy again, we will give him a hat (Sonic's hedgehog...) 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.000
 I have never done any crafts in my life, so I don't understand why I am qualified to make this film. 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.600
 But no matter what, let's get started. OK, we must first do a good job. 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.080
 This thing is a bit like... very thick plastic stuff (??). 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.240
 These are all I went to the craft shop with Marzia and we went to the craft shop for the film. 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.360
 Ok, we have a shoe sole 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.560
 We are doing extremely serious work, okay? It’s definitely not a "bad weekend..." 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.280
 "DYI...?" 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.180
 D...D...(unexpected) 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.740
 Marzia: DIY 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:32.800
 "...DIY" 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.980
 Do you think this is funny? 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.180
 Then go ahead, we are already done... 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.820
 *Maya goes forward to observe* 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.820
 Made two soles. It is approved by Maya. Maya, do you recognize it? 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.720
 *thinking* 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:42.480
 *Ran* 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.940
 I think that means "YES"! 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.760
 Ok, let's take this step, we need 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.200
 * Stealing the phone * Do... that, the one above the footboard. 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.520
 Is this piece 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.020
 If I want to do it for myself, it will become like this. do you understand me? 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.500
 Do you understand me???? 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.380
 I want this piece to be consistent with the sole... 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.640
 Then we have to follow it 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.500
 I will cut it a little bigger because we need it a little bigger... right, Marzia? 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.000
 Marzia: Uh huh 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.100
 Am I right? 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.360
 See how accurate my instincts are. 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.920
 These years of ... what (P forget the words I want to say) gave me a wealth of knowledge 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.540
 Take me with me, let my mind find the answer 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.320
 People go to school, they go to the craft school 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.180
 I have never been to a craft school (self-feeling good) 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.660
 Having said that, do you still remember the stupid movie that "Have your smile lost"? 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.560
 There is a person inside the hedgehog belly. You may wonder why there are hedgehogs, well, that is why we raise hedgehogs. 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.100
 After we saw it, we thought, "It’s so cute, we want a hedgehog right away." 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:44.060
 That's it, the hedgehog is like this. 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.060
 Ok, now we come 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.000
 ...if you ask me, I think it’s quite like Sonic’s shoes. 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.000
 A little secret: glue gun 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.000
 Hot melt glue gun. Professionals use glue guns. All professional. 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.680
 Look at Maya 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.700
 It is in use 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.940
 Taking advantage of the glue gun heating, let's take a look (top of Sonic's shoes) 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.740
 *By hot melt adhesive to * 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.260
 There is a piece across the shoe, we have to cut it out. 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.540
 This requires a high degree of precision and expertise -- 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.200
 *Poisoning status* 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.000
 - Focus. Now I feel like playing CUPHEAD, it’s exactly the same 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:22.140
 Video game reporters are impossible to do 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.760
 * Flight attendant* 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.740
 It seems that we are doing well, buddy. I feel very proud now, but I know what you are thinking: 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.180
 "Felix is ​​not sticky" 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:30.400
 "This is not sticky at all." 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:34.420
 Oh oh oh a little further away 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.980
 like this 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:37.980
 M: I don't quite keep up. 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.220
 You better keep up if you want to join "Pewdiepie's crafting" 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.700
 My new channel 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.820
 "This is my new channel" is also the stalk created by me. 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.580
 No other youtuber... will take "do craft channel" as a joke and really implement 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.460
 Get it! 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.280
 Then we have to cut out a hole so that the foot can reach in, right? 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:01.300
 M: Uh huh 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.300
 Right? M: Uh huh. 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.020
 Yes, so we have to do this next, right. (confirm *n times) M: Right? 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.120
 Then I am now... 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.560
 M: Don't do too much, I know you will do too much. 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:09.480
 Marzia, I know 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.540
 M: Why do you only make one pair (shoes), I don't mean to have two pairs (real world hedgehog has four legs) 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:12.800
 Yes, but that... 

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.580
 How many Sonic shoes are there? Marzia? 

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:15.400
 How is this hole? 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.560
 M: Yeah, is it a good hole? 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.460
 Not too small? For little feet 

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:25.240
 This is actually quite interesting... I have never done handicrafts before. 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.820
 My other genius-level move: 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.520
 You can see this sole, I am doing a little small 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.040
 So what we have to do is squeeze the glue from the outside and stick it... this is what I think of. 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.040
 M: No, no, no, what are you doing? 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.060
 M:NONONONONONO 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.840
 No, this is my Idea... Are you not saying this way? 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.180
 Look, look at it 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.500
 Wait, OH NO, this thing is very swaying, 哎哟

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.620
 As you can see, my hand... 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:57.520
 In adjusting... 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.700
 Another shoe 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.200
 This is what Marzia tried to do for me (rotten) 

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:04.740
 (...is yours) 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.220
 And this is 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.840
 The one I am doing 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.580
 I should have done this for you, it will be simpler. 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.760
 Ok, you can see that we are sticking them up -- 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.700
 I am stuck... very precise 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.640
 We work hard here (lazy) 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.060
 Very busy very crafty (craft=handcraft, crafty has awkward meaning) 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.720
 *Marzia呛pewds is doing badly* 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.040
 Hey, you can clearly see the improvement. 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.040
 Guess which one is what I did? 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:33.400
 M: This is not sticky yet. 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.659
 Don't care too much. 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.920
 We haven't finished yet. We also need to add socks 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:43.160
 Sonic is wearing a small socks 

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:47.080
 Why are you so skilled with glue guns? I always squeeze too much when I use them. 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.480
 Do you have a Sonic fan? 

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:53.840
 Fast, fast and fast 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.700
 Look at this Sonic shoes, MAN 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:59.540
 M: There is glue hanging on your hand. 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.520
 Yes, the speed of the shoes is too fast, so the surface is melted. 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.960
 Why do I always squeeze too much glue? I don't understand. 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.440
 Handicraft, what is the most annoying 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.420
 It's all for Doggy, ok? 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.760
 The child we love, he needs this 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.600
 You may want to know what I am doing, I am actually making an egg... a circle (may be old, accidentally messing up egg/ring) 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:18.520
 We are doing a circle because we all know that Sonic likes the circle (what is the yellow circle in the game?) 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.160
 And we don't know... 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.820
 *Talk to Marzia* In fact, he (Doggy) likes your jewelry very much (jewellery refers to jewelry), isn't it? 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:23.320
 M: Uh huh 

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:26.440
 OMG, Sonic... Doggy also likes jewelry 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.440
 This looks like a circle 

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:34.380
 It's a bit like those boring... like Sonic's meme and the like. 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.460
 This actually did not imagine the difference. 

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.540
 Not? 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:39.700
 I thought it would be worse. 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.620
 I think my first craft is just the first lesson in 500 lessons. 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.380
 This looks neat and tidy 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:48.380
 I know what you want to ask now: 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.100
 Can he wear these shoes? 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.100
 Probably not, NO 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:54.320
 He is in a bad mood now. 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.460
 He looked at me like saying "What the hell" 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:00.800
 You can see that he has set up the thorns... there is a piece on the head (sawdust?) 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.800
 Hey, do you see what we have to give you? 

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:07.720
 Oh, I think we should measure the size first because this is too small. 

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:12.540
 Do you know Doggy, I have worked hard, this is my first time doing craftsmanship. 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:14.400
 I have never even done to Eddie (who?) 

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:15.460
 Please be sure to love me. 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.340
 Too small 

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.700
 Oh, no, ah. 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:21.280
 Doggy, do you like this circle? 

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.560
 Ok, then, uh... 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.680
 Marzia, you did this. 

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:30.320
 You made another pair of shoes because our camera didn't have electricity... (so didn't take it) 

00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.220
 Oh! This seems to fit well. 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.640
 As you can see, this is really a good idea... (shoes are gone) 

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.080
 Seriously, have you actually done two pairs without any one suitable? 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:43.460
 Oh, let's wear this stupid hat for him (make sure it's not a wig) 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.160
 I made this when you were busy making shoes. 

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:51.080
 Very beautiful Sonic hat 

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:51.820
 I am sure he will 

00:07:51.860 --> 00:07:52.360
 * I want to get rid of the foreign objects on my head* 

00:07:52.480 --> 00:07:53.820
 I will definitely like it. 

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.940
 Well, this is the first episode in many series. 

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:00.160
 If you have any ideas, or want to see Doggy for a while 

00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:03.440
 Maybe next time we will do something for Slippy. 

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:10.280
 This time, "Crafting with Pewds" ends here, and the next episode sees you. 

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.180
 GOODBYE 

00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:16.120
 He wants to sleep here. He used to sleep here super cute DE 

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.660
 Dear friends and relatives (Squad fam), 啪咔嚓 (refresh the sound of the five senses) 

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.380
 ...?? 

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.860
 Ok, because it was a complete failure. 

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:28.500
 And the hat is doing the best, isn't it? I know what you are thinking about. 

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:31.100
 Slippy needs a hat, no guessing wrong (...10 minutes?) 

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:33.700
 Now let's make a hat for Slippy. 

00:08:33.940 --> 00:08:36.760
 He has been thinking for a long time, he said: 

00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:38.060
 "Fe...Fellur" 

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:42.460
 Why don't you give me a hat and let me... wear? 

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.420
 We must first cut this small piece. 

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.300
 This will be the front end of the hat 

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:47.420
 You know, hats are like this. 

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.420
 If the hat has this little thing, it should be very cute. 

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.300
 This will be the front end of the hat... 

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.160
 This will be the top stuff 

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.200
 Slippy is a big trend, but everyone doesn't know, but we have to stick him up. 

00:08:58.660 --> 00:09:02.280
 ...this time I feel like I am doing what I am doing... I mean I know what I am doing every time. 

00:09:02.380 --> 00:09:03.900
 Ok, now 

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:05.900
 There are some extra parts 

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.700
 Don't worry, the extra is OK, because we can cut them off. 

00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:12.020
 As I cut it off... 

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.140
 My marriage is the same 

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:17.560
 Maya is jealous because we are taking this 

00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:20.100
 She is saying, "Why don't you shoot me?" 

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.980
 When I was doing this, I was extremely focused... try to keep up. 

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.240
 If you have jealousy or hedgehog, this will be a good teaching film for you, you can try to do it yourself. 

00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.980
 Ok, we have to get some glue. 

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:33.700
 At the edge of this thing 

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:37.800
 This is the weird thing... Why does PEWDIEPIE fall so far? 

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:41.700
 I just want to say sorry to the DIY community on youtube. 

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:45.800
 This starts to look like a hat, as you said there is a little extra 

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.860
 But remember how I told you before? 

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:48.900
 Excess is a good thing 

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:49.940
 ...what happened? 

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.820
 *M is laughing* What is going on? 

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.640
 Do you want to wear this? 

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:03.560
 We have to take a white mic pen to draw a sign on the top of the hat. 

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.140
 Be very careful to write 

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.960
 This is really hard, I am focusing 

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:22.480
 "Let PEWDIEPIE be great again" 

00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.720
 I want to abbreviate a word (PDP, not enough position) 

00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:30.140
 Looks a bit like tweet 

00:10:30.140 --> 00:10:32.140
 She looks like Super Mario 

00:10:32.600 --> 00:10:33.520
 so cute 

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:34.760
 Ok, let's go. 

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.540
 I am very excited now. 

00:10:37.650 --> 00:10:39.760
 Slippy? How are you doing? Brother? 

00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:43.460
 I now find that I overestimate your size. 

00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:44.540
 OMG 

00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:46.840
 OMG (laugh) 

00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:48.660
 I can't think of this real thing (laugh) 

00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.780
 He likes it very much. 

00:10:53.860 --> 00:10:55.160
 * Resentful eyes* 

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.780
 He has no stool or something else. 

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:58.780
 M: He looks very hot. 

00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:00.680
 He seems super angry 

00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:02.940
 He is saying "What is on my face, dude" 

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.080
 OMG 

00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:08.600
 This works. I am a craftsman, I am a craftsman. 

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:10.160
 It has been identified 

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.400
 That's it 

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:13.340
 I am exhausted, so tired
