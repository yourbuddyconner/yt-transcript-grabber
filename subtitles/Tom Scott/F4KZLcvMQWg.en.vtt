00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.660
 It is not surprising that the futuristic dreams of the past for monorail transport have not come true. 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.030
 Nowadays, monorail trains are known as lunar attractions 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.049
 or short-distance carriage at airports, 

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.889
 or expensive, impractical projects that lead to nowhere. 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.560
 Sydney, Australia, destroyed its monorail a few years ago. 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.250
 Well, monorails look cool but real 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.680
 to build is a terrible idea. 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.580
 But in some places in the world they really work. 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:27.590
 This is Wuppertal in Germany, 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:29.090
 where not only have a monorail - 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.090
 created more than a century ago, the suspended railway still carries 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.460
 about 80 000 people over long distances. 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.050
 Forget about the ideas presented at the World Fairs in the 1980s: 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.820
 the construction of this began in the 19th century, 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.399
 and has been constantly updated. 

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.530
 It looks like something coming out of "Thunderbirds". 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.649
 There is a great story about how she once carried an elephant, 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.829
 who panicked, fell into the river and miraculously survived. 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:57.130
 So why are monorails such a terrible idea? 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:58.670
 Compared with other options, 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.809
 they are more expensive and unreliable. 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.809
 First you need a railroad line erected above the ground. 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:08.021
 Required is the so-called transport flooring - the entire route. 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.500
 Even in rare cases, when at ground level, 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.180
 you have to put huge concrete blocks on which to move 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.470
 instead of ordinary rails. And taking into account the costs, 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.280
 governments are basically building only one route 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.810
 and if something breaks, the whole system fails, 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.920
 and passengers have to evacuate from a high altitude. 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.970
 You can solve the same problems with 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.080
 an ordinary rail system that is being built for less money. 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.510
 Or with a tram that runs on already existing roads 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.610
 with rails laid on them. 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.979
 Or you can use the simplest option - a bus. 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:44.720
 But it does not look so cool. 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.080
