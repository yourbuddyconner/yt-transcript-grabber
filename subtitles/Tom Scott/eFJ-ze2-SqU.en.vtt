00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 I made a lot of shots in Spitsbergen, 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.420
 more than I can ever use in normal videos, so I thought I'd take some time to show them, 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.820
 and at the same time explain how to get there, what you can do there, 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:12.560
 and whether it is worthwhile to go on this adventure. 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:16.500
 I'm no longer there, but in an old fortress in Oslo, 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.820
 what kind of resting place during the return journey. 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.000
 Tim and Matt, the people I travel with, each do their own thing. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.400
 We have been packed for three to four days and can no longer stand each other. 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.500
 So I thought, let me deal with some frequently asked questions 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.260
 while at the same time I show you beautiful recordings of the North Pole. 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.920
 How do you get there? 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:40.400
 Spitsbergen has become much more accessible in recent years. 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:47.920
 We expected to have to apply for many visas and permits, but none of them. 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:54.080
 First, no one needs a visa for Spitsbergen, although it is necessary to go via Norway, 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.760
 So if you are allowed to enter Norway, Spitsbergen is open for you. 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:03.200
 You just book a flight. Matt, Tim and I were shocked by that; we just booked from our phones 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.940
 and from a resaurant. We expected to take a kind of special tour, 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:11.240
 or a scientific license. It does not work like that. You go online, book a flight to Spitsbergen, 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.420
 with destination Longyearbyan Airport. And it is a normal, modern airport as elsewhere. 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.900
 You book a flight, you book a hotel, the hotel is on the normal booking sites. 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.620
 There is a Scandic and a Radisson. We stayed in the coalmine workers' huts, 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.420
 who have an incredible history, and had the only free rooms when we wanted to go. 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.740
 It is difficult to say. Compared internationally, the facilities are provisional, without their own bathrooms, 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.000
 you have to walk through the hall to take a shower, but in practical terms there is hot and cold tap water, 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.780
 and even fast Wi-Fi connection! 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.320
 It is just like arranging a holiday elsewhere. 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.540
 It is slightly more expensive because you go to the polar circle, 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:52.560
 but the flights are not really noticeably worse than in other remote areas. 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:54.260
 It's practically the same. 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.440
 The hotel also had a fair price. 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.860
 Spitsbergen is tax-free, so it's expensive to buy something, but it's similar to London, 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.360
 because there are no taxes on top. 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.700
 We came back on a scheduled flight from Norwegian Airlines, 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.600
 and they are practically the Jet Blue, 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.420
 or the EasyJet from Scandinavia. 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.900
 You go. 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.280
 How "extreme" is a visit to Longyearbyen? 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.740
 Spitsbergen is not remote, although that is physically true, 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:29.440
 after all, you are 78 degrees in the north. When we were at the airport, we were 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.380
 one of the thousand or perhaps 500 most northerly people on the planet, which is best one 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.180
 strong claim to be able to make. 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:41.960
 But at the same time there is fast Wi-Fi in all hotels. 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:48.720
 Oh, and they use credit cards everywhere; even on the bus that you get from the airport 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.940
 to the hotel they accept credit cards and bank cards. 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.540
 If you have something that works in Europe and has a chip and pin code, 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.960
 then it will be all right. 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.620
 There is fast 3G and I think 4G. We posted messages on Instagram and Twitter. 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.980
 It just works. 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.980
 They have a submarine cable, not even satellite internet. 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.300
 It is fast, just like everywhere else, in a city in Norway. 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:16.800
 What is there to do? 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.680
 There are two types of people who want to see this, 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.340
 the one is: "This is pretty fun, I will not go, I prefer something more comfortable." 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.600
 That is a good choice and I respect that. 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.920
 And then there are people like me who saw pictures of Longyearbyen - 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:36.200
 I think I was wrong ... "Longyearbean," I do not get the vowels right - they saw pictures of them 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.880
 and they thought, "Oh, here I want to go, this is great!" 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.000
 What is there to see? 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.720
 As a tourist, and let's face it unless you are part of a scientific expedition 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.140
 or doing a study in microbiology at the poles 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.180
 - like someone we met on the bus from the airport, 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:55.300
 Unless you do something like that, you're just a tourist. 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.980
 There are travel organizations, 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:59.960
 and it works the same as anywhere else in the world. 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.080
 You look it up on the Internet, google it, look at the organizations, 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.400
 "I want to do this, I want to do that." 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.400
 We went on a tour with a minibus through the local areas, which I absolutely recommend, 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.860
 because you can not leave the settlement without a firearm (!) 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.620
 It is also quite far away. 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:17.440
 We visited the seed vault, 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.420
 we caught at least a glimpse of the solar research station that is there, 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.640
 and we got to hear stories about the city and the people who lived there, 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:28.580
 and I can certainly recommend that. 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.380
 We also went kayaking in a fjord, 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.060
 what is hard work. My muscles hurt. 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:39.000
 But if you want it, it must be in the summer. 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:46.520
 If you go in winter or in spring you can take the snowmobile, or "ice scooter," over the fjord. 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:50.700
 Besides kayaking, we also went on a speed boat trip. 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:58.240
 What I recommend, but you have to be aware that you sit on a somewhat uncomfortable saddle chair for about five hours. 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.000
 You know the short trips, bounce over the water. That is this too, but then for hours. 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:14.140
 If you want to, do it. It is awesome. You get to see the glaciers and stand on something that looks like Mars, or the Moon. 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:24.220
 After all, there are no trees on the poles. Geology and geography are like nowhere else on Earth. 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.900
 And you can do things that you can not do anywhere else. 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:33.300
 More options: a dog sled, on irons or wheels depending on the season; 

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.960
 you can take a long, slow boat trip to Pyramids, the deserted Russian mining village, 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.780
 what is now a ghost town with the northernmost statue of Lenin; 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.260
 and much, much more. 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:49.020
 Do research, see if the travel organization is reliable, but honestly ... 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.680
 There are few crimes in Spitsbergen because only a few thousand people live there. 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.760
 Most people know each other. 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.600
 And there is little to ... ah, I can imagine that 'crimes against the person' exist. 

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:05.280
 There are people who get drunk in the bar and someone outside in the polar night a blow sell, 

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.260
 but crime is not very common here. 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.540
 I think that an organization that lights up people would soon be chased away. 

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.860
 What you need to bring? 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.680
 You must bring suitable outer clothing for the season. 

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.120
 We went during the hottest time of the year, 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:26.240
 which was about six to eight degrees Celcius, so early-mid forty degrees Fahrenheit. 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.440
 Large waterproof windbreakers with gloves were fine. 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.120
 You do not need much more if you go. 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.440
 If you go in the winter, I assume you know how to survive the pool. 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.520
 That is certainly necessary. In summer, you need sunscreen. 

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.440
 It may be cold, but that does not mean that it is unnecessary. We were constantly spreading it. 

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.440
 That must be real. 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:53.400
 You also need to bring a pair of shoes that can easily be put on and off. 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.760
 So from those big outer shoes, preferably easy to loose and tie. 

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.440
 And then you still need indoor shoes. 

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:06.420
 The reason is that in Spitsbergen it is customary to stay in a hotel, restaurant, or something in that spirit, 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:13.460
 take off your shoes, pull those big, dirty, frozen chests, and something more comfortable. 

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:16.780
 This is much easier if you take something that goes well 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:21.400
 instead of the plastic disposable shoes that are available for people who forget this. 

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.420
 And it's handy if you can quickly unbutton the laces of your big, heavy crates. 

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:29.220
 I did not have easy laces, 

00:07:29.220 --> 00:07:34.220
 and I had to leave my hotel room, go outside, put on my shoes, 

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:38.920
 take ten steps to the place where you had breakfast and take them off again. 

00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:42.020
 Take comfortable shoes, and shoes with easy to tie laces. 

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:47.300
 Make sure you have good gloves; for what you will do, you will need them. 

00:07:47.300 --> 00:07:51.220
 So: sunscreen, good shoes, gloves and a camera. 

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:55.020
 Almost everything is arranged by the travel agencies if you use them. 

00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:01.540
 There are stores here. I keep saying, this is not a remote outpost, this is a city. 

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:04.140
 It is only quite far from the rest of the civilized world. 

00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:08.000
 What should you avoid? 

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:14.340
 If you are wise, you do not have much to fear: do not leave the settlements, follow the instructions. 

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:19.380
 It will be all right. There is nothing to worry about. 

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:24.240
 I give up all the reputations I would get with this, but 

00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.100
 All in all, this is a regular attraction like many others. 

00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:31.660
 It is obscure and remote, and it sounds impressive. 

00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:37.680
 But it is so much easier than ten twenty years ago; you can just go. 

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.100
