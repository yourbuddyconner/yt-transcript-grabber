00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.940
 Behind me lies London City Airport, built on the old harbor in East London. 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.000
 They are building a new control tower here to replace the 30 year old 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.520
 and to make room for expansion 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.640
 But there are no people in this new tower. 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:13.100
 It only a high mast with a lot of cameras. 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.020
 The people are 130 km away. 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.920
 - We're here in the London City ops room. Which will be commissioned in January 2020. 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.960
 And from here we will guide the air traffic from London City. 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.000
 London City does not have much space. 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.660
 So the footprint that is recorded by this mast 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.220
 is considerably smaller than that of a traditional tower. 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.380
 The digital tower can be cheaper and is significantly easier to build. 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.100
 You do not need functionality that you would need if there are people in it. 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.040
 There are therefore no relaxation areas, kitchens, toilets. 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.422
 Through the use of additions to the screen, 

00:00:41.422 --> 00:00:44.000
 we can show a plane with its radar number while flying over the screen. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.900
 They can see the call code, speed and altitude. 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.580
 We have pa-tilt-zoom cameras here 

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.920
 In theory you can even look straight into the sun to follow planes 

00:00:49.926 --> 00:00:51.887
 flying to the south. 

00:00:51.887 --> 00:00:54.761
 You can not do that with binoculars, but with this system. 

00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:58.220
 This is a 360 degree panorama which is compressed in 225 degrees. 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.140
 This has the advantage for the controller that it does not 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.300
 have to look over his shoulder when something is flying behind him. 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.520
 You can see the lighting of planes coming this way from 20-25km 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.320
 The visibility of this system is much better than with the naked eye. 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.740
 The data is compressed on location. 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.200
 And then by a few large pipelines pushed to Swanwick. 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.060
 We specify a delay of less than 1 second, 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.340
 that is the same amount of delay we have for speech communication with the pilots. 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.360
 - At the moment the new control room is used for training. 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.640
 The camera mast is not yet made, so they use previously filmed material 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.320
 from a tap, a few months ago. 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.240
 Digital control towers are already being used at smaller airports. 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.060
 But this is the first in a big city 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.920
 and with this level of air traffic. 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.340
 Something like this should not only be flawless 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.100
 there must also be no risks. 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.540
 - Every controller is conservative by nature. 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.120
 For that reason they keep a "what if" in their mind. 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.780
 What if the screen goes down, what if the image falls away? 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.160
 What if a camera fails. 

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:52.980
 All these things have been included in the design. 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.560
 At the top of the screens is a "wake-up indicator" 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.440
 If it is quiet during the day 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.480
 and there is not much traffic 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.520
 then you know that you are still looking at the airport 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.320
 and not to a stuck picture of the airport. 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.260
 If you lose a screen, the system is smart enough 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.040
 to recognize that 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.820
 the system will send that picture to a spare screen 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.320
 and rearrange all other images so that the controller has a suitable image again. 

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.120
 Then a technician can come and replace the screen in about 5 to 10 minutes. 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.320
 If a camera fails, we can use the pan-tilt-zoom camera at the top of the screen. 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:23.540
 It can replicate the image of a normal camera. 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.640
 When it rains, there is an air compressor that blows away the rain. 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.080
 There is bird protection on top and there are heating elements in it 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.080
 the image is then not foggy or frozen in winter. 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.380
 if the cameras fall out completely, 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.740
 then we manage the transition as if there is thick fog. 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.460
 There are still a number of backup routes. 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.460
 We have separate speech communication with the airport 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.240
 Controllers can not see anything in the fog, you lose the cameras 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.900
 and we then slowly make the same transition. 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.220
 We use different data feeds. 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.540
 They come from the mast, 1 goes to the east, the other to the west. 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.440
 They are not on the public internet and they do not go into the cloud. 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.260
 They do not go through the same pipes. 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.440
 They are robust and secure. 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.700
 - I do not want this to sound like a sponsored video. 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.700
 That's not it. 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.940
 But after my visit to the new control center, 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:04.620
 there is a part of my brain 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.940
 who is convinced that it works and is safe. 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.860
 Given the additions to the screen and the extra height 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.260
 it might be safer than the old tower. 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.380
 But it does not feel that good and I do not really have a good reason why not. 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.560
 It often happens that you think "This does not feel right" 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:21.600
 And that can be a reason not to do something. 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.740
 A bad relationship, walking into a dark alley in the evening; 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.720
 your brain is good at avoiding things that are not good for you. 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.780
 But aviation is something that is so far from the day-to-day reality 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:34.260
 and where safety is so important 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.800
 that you can not rule it with a bad feeling. 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.820
 The evidence is solid. 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:43.220
 And if I'm on a flight by 2020 that leaves from here, 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.280
 then I will certainly swing at the cameras when we leave. 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.820
 Please tell me we have that!
