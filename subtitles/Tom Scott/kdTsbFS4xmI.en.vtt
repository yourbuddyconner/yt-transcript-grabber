00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.519
 In June 2015, I went to Sheffield, and saw a paternoster lift, 

00:00:03.519 --> 00:00:07.730
 an outdated design elevator, with a revolving chain of open cabs. 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.100
 In June 2016, I traveled to Genoa in Italy 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.230
 and I saw a lift that also moved sideways 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.090
 except that it was actually a little cheating, 

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.510
 it is actually a small horizontal cart 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.550
 that moves into a larger lift that does all the heavy lifting. 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:20.710
 And now it is June 2017. 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.660
 And I am in Germany, at the brand new Thyssenkrupp lift test tower 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.710
 and they flew me here to show Multi, 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.269
 their actual, life-size, working lift 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.290
 that moves sideways without cheating. 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.070
 For us it was very important to have a tower to test the new technology 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.820
 We do not want to test it on the customer's location. 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.520
 The tower is 246m high, and thus 1700 steps. 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.400
 I know exactly, because I myself once walked upstairs! 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.420
 This is a building that is almost entirely made of elevator shafts 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.329
 Some test normal lifts 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.900
 but some are reserved for this new system. 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:03.870
 The principle of a continuous rotating flow of cabins 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.139
 was one of the best inventions in our industry ever. 

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:14.159
 And in order to achieve this, we have to exchange booths, from one shaft to another. 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.939
 And to keep this exchange, we have to have an exchanger, 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.950
 which you see behind me. 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.859
 This exchanger ensures that we can move horizontally. 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:25.799
 The exchanger can be placed at any point in the shaft, 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.599
 he thus allows us to do all kinds of configurations. 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.409
 Drop vertically, and then move horizontally. 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.340
 One of the problems with elevators in very tall buildings 

00:01:38.349 --> 00:01:42.320
 is that you need a cable that is so long that it can not lift its own weight, 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.109
 let alone the weight of the cabin attached to it. 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.609
 The solution here is a bit different, and he uses no cables at all. 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:51.060
 He uses linear induction motors. 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:58.539
 Linear drive - it is also a synchronous motor with permanent magnets, 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:01.929
 maybe you know it from a rotary engine. 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.119
 If we just take this engine, and cut off half of it 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.399
 and just lay it flat on the table, 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:11.680
 then you already have a linear drive 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.959
 So this is what we have, vertically and also horizontally. 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.239
 In an ordinary elevator, that's called a friction lift, 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.340
 do you have cables that keep the cabin up 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.750
 each of which can hold up more than the designed weight 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.189
 You also have emergency brakes that come out 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.280
 and slow down the cab with friction if it moves too fast. 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.410
 And in the worst worst case, if all fails in one way or another fails 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.159
 you have a buffer on the bottom that has a free fall 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.620
 from "fatal" to "serious injuries". 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.879
 Lifts are incredibly safe because they are very well regulated. 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.219
 So before this is allowed people carry it 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.969
 the system must be at least just as failsafe. 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.299
 Safety is not just in the ropes of a traditional lift 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:53.900
 but in the brake system. 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.989
 In traditional lifts you have the brake 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.400
 in the machine at the top of the shaft in the engine room, 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.489
 now we have the brake directly in the cabs. 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.269
 This new component, the exchanger, 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.760
 where we can go from vertical to horizontal, 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.620
 must also be checked by our security inspectorate. 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.440
 What is the position of the exchanger? 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.499
 Is he locked? 

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:18.790
 Is he safe? 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.760
 And in the case of a breach of the security rule, 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.000
 then we go to a "safe state". 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.580
 There are of course some snakes in the grass. 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:31.189
 Linear induction motors are expensive and heavy. 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:33.349
 Each of the cabs must have its own set. 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:35.920
 And the whole elevator shaft, from the bottom to the top, 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.040
 must be coated with the magnetic coil that gives them power. 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.040
 To save weight, the cabs are made of carbon fiber and aluminum. 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.780
 So, will it work in the real world? 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.340
 Thyssenkrupp's models say yes, 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.219
 once everything has been tested and approved here, 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:50.349
 is the next step to sell it 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.920
 to the kind of huge multinational company that builds skyscrapers 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.689
 and does not like risk. 

00:03:55.689 --> 00:04:00.300
 And that is perhaps an even bigger challenge than Ã¼berhaubt make the elevator. 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:03.909
 Many thanks to the team here at Thyssenkrupp that invited me. 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.049
