00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.360
This is the Technical Difficulties, we're playing Citation Needed.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.060
Joining me today - he reads books you know - it's Chris Joel!

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.160
No letters once more.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:07.920
The bounciest man on the internet, Matt Gray!

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.420
Hello!

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.180
And everybody's favourite Gary Brannan: Gary Brannan!

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.880
Accompany me into the inner reaches of Dale Winton.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.720
In front of me, I've got an article from Wikipedia and these folks can't see it

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.080
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [ding]

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.520
And there's a special prize for particularly good answers is...

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.820
Think I've set a personal best there.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.260
Today we are talking about The Jimmy Carter Rabbit Incident.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.960
Oh brilliant! Giant, swimming rabbit [ding] attacks Jimmy Carter [ding]

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.320
whilst fishing [ding]

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.140
Ha!

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.680
Right, that's it, we can go home, we can go home.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.780
Personal best. Right, see you everybody,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.960
That's us done for the day.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.420
Were you both going for that?

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.060
Did you beat Gary to that?

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.560
Yeah.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.360
It's one of my few, sort of, extra super special bits

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.880
of weird general knowledge and I knew Brannan'd know it as well.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.540
You know what, I didn't actually, so well played.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.020
I genuinely thought you'd beaten him to the punch there

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.800
Well I thought I -

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.500
No, I was going to make up some schtick

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.400
but the point is, what I was going to make up weren't too far from the truth, fact is.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.060
I mean, obviously you've won, but -

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.720
Obviously this show is now entirely redundant for you, the viewer,

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.140
I mean, this is the way we should have done them all along -

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.340
Let's explore this because there's quite a lot to go on here.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.720
What do you know about this?

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.720
Ostensibly, an enormous rodent swimming across a lake to Jimmy Carter--

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.720
who's fishing in this little sort of boat about the size of our table.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.640
- US President Jimmy Carter -

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.100
He's up at whatever the country retreat is

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.860
and this thing just sort of gets up on the back end of the boat

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.180
and he's wailing on it with the oar.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.240
It was a swamp rabbit, swamp hare.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.980
Of course - only in America would they call it a "swamp rabbit"

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.020
give it the real, dangerous edge it obviously needs.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.940
It's a large, cotton tailed rabbit. It's a big thing.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:52.460
Looks about like that.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.020
Essentially, it's still a rabbit though, yeah?

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.060
Yeah. That can swim!

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.800
But it's got big nasty pointy teeth and it can jump through about-

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.360
Okay, it can swim, that's one thing. If it had its own kayak, I'd be more worried, let's face it.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.120
No no, it's much harder to get out of a kayak into another boat --

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.720
The rabbit can use a kayak, but it's on attack mode, you know.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.060
So we've got an amphibious rabbit attack as well.

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.460
I can imagine it just whittling away...

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.100
It only didn't use its torpedos because, you know,

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.500
there's only one of 'em. I can take him hand-to-hand.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.940
And it'd get launched backwards!

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.420
In the middle of this lake, a log-made submarine just pokes the conning tower above the surface.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.260
The top unscrews - donk! - out comes a rabbit in a naval uniform.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.820
"Fire!" "Sir, it's ungentlemanly to torpedo our president without giving him prior warning."

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.940
"F*** it, I'll take it meself then!"

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.380
And that was the problem. The problem was --

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:40.460
Dagger in his mouth. Aaah!

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:48.420
-- what was a fairly mundane story, is really funny when you start riffing on it. And everyone did.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.440
This is very funny anyway, because let's face it,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.260
It's a president being attacked by a f------ great rabbit, I mean, that's got --

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.360
Can you imagine, just, translating it here?

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.620
Gordon Brown is out one day, I don't know, cycling along the road

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.240
a sheep gets out and whales the s--- out of him. I'm sorry, I'd watch that day and night!

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.160
What was the president's side of the story?

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.440
The left hand side.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.760
He was out there fishing in a peaceful fashion.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.460
Maybe those things he did against the rabbits in his time in office came back to bite him on the ass quite literally.

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.740
No, he said the rabbit had good reason for being in a panic and jumping away.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.580
Was it being chased by a crocodile?

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.780
It's being chased by something.

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.480
FBI agents, there to escort the president.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.640
A court order.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.000
Hounds, but I'm gonna give you a point for "being chased" there, Matt [ding].

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.880
Okay, okay. So the rabbit's being hunted, and he's running away.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.240
Yup, and he said,

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.440
"Swam toward my boat, when he almost got there, I splashed some water with a paddle."

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.120
That is Jimmy Carter's side of the story.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.140
I was gonna say, that sounds very much like one side of the story in any incident.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.600
"So I'm innocently on the water, I just splashed me paddle, next thing I know he's on me!"

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.040
Turns out he called his mum a ****** or something while he was coming over.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.240
What did Carter's staff say about this when he got back to his office?

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.900
-- The staff, as in the oar?
-- No.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.120
"Ha ha, hahahahahahaha, boss, you got your ass kicked by a rabbit."

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.020
No.

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.760
Nothing! They were mute.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.040
Because they too were rabbits. Tinfoil hat.

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.400
Yeah, giant rabbit conspiracy tried to take over the giant lizard government of the world.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.180
Exactly, inside job man. Inside job.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.920
No, um --

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:18.600
Rabbits can't cut through steel beams.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.780
Um, rabbits can't what?

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.160
Cut through steel beams.

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.020
Um, replace -

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.640
Swim!

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.920
Thank you! Have a point. They insisted rabbits couldn't swim.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:29.480
Well, I think they just got called bull---- on that one!

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:32.540
Yeah, well, no one believed him apart from then the incident was captured --

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.560
-- on literally - there's video.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.300
Puts on tinfoil hat. "How convenient."

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.120
"There just happened to be a camera there when the rabbit attacked the president."

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.720
False flag, people! False flag! They set it up!

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.300
There was a second rabbit behind the Grassy Knoll!

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:51.740
Firing his torpedos.

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.500
Yes, there was a second rabbit, in the submarine!

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.660
You can only just make out the picture 'cause they haven't got very good steadycam.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:04:59.380
When you say footage, it is just a photo.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.640
Hang on a sec.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:05.560
Rewind. Grassy knoll - is a small little hill is it not?

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.460
It is.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.120
What would live inside a small little hill?

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.400
-- Teletubbies!
-- Teletubbies!

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.640
Yeah, Teletubbies killed Kennedy, that's where I was going with this.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.080
Nunu's about to be very naughty.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.600
I've got the thought that the Lee Harvey Oswald footage being re-cut now for Tinky-Winky, being pulled out

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.780
being pulled out as Po jumps out.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.200
"This president - is tubby-toast."

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.720
Meanwhile, the rabbits, who are behind all this s---

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.620
-- Oh, God!
-- they're still on the Grassy Knoll!

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.240
"Excellent," they cried.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.260
-- Theme from Watership Down plays. The end.
-- Yup.

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.940
But in a minor key, just to make it a little bit more evil.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:54.160
More evil than Watership Down?!

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:55.720
Yeah.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.920
Obviously, the president did not mention this to reporters

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:03.480
because "I got chased by a rabbit and had to splash it away" is not a good PR story.

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:04.720
How did it leak?

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:06.480
Rabbits did it.

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.920
Conspiracy. It's a rabbit conspiracy.

00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:11.880
Well how did the boat leak? I think a rabbit took a big friggin' chunk out of it by the sound of it.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.120
Well if someone photographed it...

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:18.360
The White House press photographer. Official. It wouldn't have gotten out of there.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:22.360
When they got it developed, the developer saw it...

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.440
No, so it's - the press secretary just kinda told a reporter about it.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.080
'Cause it is quite funny.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.280
It is quite funny,

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:36.100
and the reporter promptly filed that with a wire service, and the story, "President attacked by rabbit,"

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.040
promptly appeared on the Washington Post.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.400
I could absolutely see David Cameron getting...

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.160
Oh yeah. The thing is, they hadn't released the photo

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.040
because they didn't want the photo of the president hitting the rabbit to...

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:49.840
So what was on the front of the Washington Post?

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.240
A cartoon - an artist's impression. [ding]

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:56.840
Yes, you're getting the point straight away, but bear in mind, this is 1979.

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.300
What would've happened in 1979?

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:05.140
What pop culture thing would they have used for President attacked by rabbit?

00:07:05.140 --> 00:07:07.200
Disco, or something like that?

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.240
It's a film.

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.800
Star Wars?

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:11.880
No...

00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:14.300
Not '77, but - '77, '81.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.340
About attacks from the water.

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:19.520
Close Encounters of the Third Kind!

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.720
Oh, that's a...!

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.440
It's wrong...

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.260
-- Gnaws!
-- Jaws!

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:28.980
That, yeah, I'll give you the point there.

00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:33.960
It was - It was "Paws". But it was the Jaws poster with a rabbit instead.

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.040
Fair enoughski.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:42.140
The White House didn't release the photo until, I quote here, "it 'turned up' during the Reagan Administration."

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.080
Filed under "rabbits, lol" in a filing cabinet.

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:51.160
Reagan quickly used it as propaganda to go and invade the rabbit nation.

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:52.500
Yes, obviously.

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:55.460
Mr. Rabbit, tear this warren down!

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:03.000
It played into this idea that Carter's presidency was hapless, was feeble,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.420
was someone who could be taken down by a rabbit.

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:13.300
But it's not the only article here listed under "Jimmy Carter, incident".

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:19.260
So fill in the blank, what's the other weird thing that happened to Jimmy Carter during his presidency?

00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.940
Well, it didn't come out during his presidency.

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:22.900
It actually happened in 1969.

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.540
Was it food? Was it a sandwich incident?

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:31.080
No! No, you might be thinking of George HW Bush throwing up in the Japanese prime minister's lap.

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:32.980
That was something that happened.

00:08:32.980 --> 00:08:36.500
He was governer of Georgia in 1969.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.700
Oh it's a funny thing, though?

00:08:37.700 --> 00:08:41.500
Oh, no, I wouldn't go with funny. I would go with spooky.

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.900
Ghost! Witch!

00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.380
Sasquatch!

00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.260
UFO.

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.020
Ohh baby. Brilliant.

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:53.720
The Jimmy Carter UFO incident, sits quite nicely next to the Jimmy Carter rabbit incident.

00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:56.540
And the two aren't linked? Tinfoil hat.

00:08:56.540 --> 00:09:02.260
Apparently not. Jimmy Carter saw an object that was bright white,

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.600
about as bright as the moon, and 30 degrees above the horizon.

00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:07.640
-- Was it the moon?
-- Was it the moon?

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.880
Now, you say that, um...

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:13.340
"It was as big as the moon, where the moon should be!

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.080
"And it looked a little bit like the moon!"

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.880
"But it was in the way of the moon! I couldn't see the moon!"

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.760
"I couldn't see the moon, for the big white moon thing in front of the moon!"

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.860
Well, apparently it changed color to blue, then red, then white.

00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:25.760
The reflection of America, in the sky!

00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.380
Did you just hit yourself really hard there?

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:29.940
-- Really quite hard.
-- Well, quite hard.

00:09:29.940 --> 00:09:31.320
It sounded like it hurt!

00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.440
About 20 people unable to work out what a mysterious light could be.

00:09:35.440 --> 00:09:37.080
Crash zoom. Rabbit.

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.280
With a red torch.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.260
Yeah.

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:41.840
Going "hahahahahahaha"!

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.440
"This'll **** 'em up! Hahaha!"

00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:48.020
What is the most likely explanation?

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:51.820
What do you see near the horizon that's frequently mistaken for a UFO?

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.620
Venus.

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.580
Point! [ding]

00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.020
Absolutely right. Jimmy Carter said he did not believe the object was Venus.

00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:00.160
What, did he think it was his plane or something? Oh, he wasn't president by this point.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.640
-- "You're late!"
-- Yeah.

00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:04.820
He thought it might be a helicopter or something like that.

00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:06.260
With a rabbit in it.

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:12.020
But what did he say during his election campaign, what did he tell reporters?

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.500
What did he do?

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.560
"If I find out I was probed by aliens, I'll let you know."

00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:18.080
That's technically true. [ding]

00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:21.180
"If I become president, I'll make every piece of information this country has

00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.580
about UFO sightings available to the public."

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:24.460
Did he?

00:10:24.460 --> 00:10:26.400
Well, there weren't any.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.340
"No, definitely not."

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:34.420
Yes, if you were in on the conspiracy, and a president coming in said,

00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:36.900
"I'm gonna make this conspiracy public,"

00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:38.820
would you let them in on the conspiracy?

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.680
Or would you show them the empty filing cabinet that says,

00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:45.060
"Evidence for UFOs", hastily written on the front.

00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:48.840
And, before that, said, "Evidence for rabbit conspiracy".

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:52.640
What did he say was the reason that he wasn't actually going to make every one of the UFO -

00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:55.860
"Truth?! You can't handle the truth!"

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.340
You know what, I'm going to give you the point. [ding]

00:10:57.340 --> 00:10:59.140
Defense implications.

00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.460
So the last one's "fill in the blanks" here.

00:11:01.460 --> 00:11:03.780
The George H. W. Bush *blank* incident?

00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:04.900
Sandwich.

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:06.540
Vomiting, but yeah I'll give you that.

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.300
It was at a formal dinner. [ding]

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.540
The Bill Clinton *blank* controversy?

00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:12.400
Monica Lewinsky?

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.540
No, haircut!

00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:14.680
What?!

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:20.100
Oh come, we've gone from "man attacked by rabbit" to "man spews on diplomat" to "man has trim".

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:24.420
Man has trim while in Air Force One and grounding other planes, allegedly.

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:25.700
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.840
The Dick Cheney *blank* incident?

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.720
-- Dick.
-- Hunting people.

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.800
Quail!

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:33.540
Hunting, yes. You can all have a point for that one. [dings]

00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:34.860
I said "dick"!

00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:41.840
I got a point for saying "Dick Cheney dick incident"!

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.760
I... may not have been paying attention there.

00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.980
Technically he's right, because Dick Cheney was involved in this.

00:11:48.980 --> 00:11:51.660
I thought you were going to say Dick Cheney was a dick!

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.080
-- Also - also true... opinion.
-- Opinion.

00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:57.580
And finally, the *blank* of Caerbannog.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:11:59.600
-- Cave.
-- Rabbit?

00:11:59.660 --> 00:12:00.620
Point. [ding]

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:02.720
Absolutely right, it's the one from "Monty Python and the Holy Grail"

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.560
and it's listed as a related article.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.160
Yes!

00:12:07.160 --> 00:12:09.780
Chris, obviously you win this week's show.

00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.640
because you knew about it and gave everyone the first few answers!

00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.960
So congratulations to you, you win permission to dress up as a famous frog and go hide in a cave.

00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:20.280
It's a hermit Kermit permit.

00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:22.800
So do enjoy that.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:24.340
[in Kermit's voice] "Yay, let's get out of here!"

00:12:24.340 --> 00:12:24.840
Yay!

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:27.040
You are dressed appropriately, so with that -

00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.220
"Miss Piggy!"

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:30.300
We say thank you to Chris Joel!

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:31.420
Matt Gray!

00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:32.220
Gary Brannan!

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:36.920
I've been Tom Scott; that has been... this run of Citation Needed!

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.340
Thank you very much! We will see you next time!

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:43.100
