00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.839
 Tucked in a valley in the Allegheny Mountains in West Virginia, it says: 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:07.029
 The Green Bank Radio Telescope, 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:10.030
 the largest fully movable radio telescope in the world. 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.290
 If you want to build an optical telescope, 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.059
 something that looks at the stars, 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.059
 would you like to be at the top of a mountain, 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.610
 you want to get through as much of the earth's atmosphere as possible. 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.900
 But a radio telescope must be isolated 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.300
 of all radio noise that humanity makes. 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.720
 One way is to build the middle between the mountains. 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.140
 Solid rock shields well. 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.010
 Another way is to let everyone around you keep silent. 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.199
 Welcome to the National Radio Quiet Zone. 

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:40.489
 eh ... This is where I would have used a wide drone recording, 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:42.020
 to give a dramatic picture. 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.100
 But remote controls are not allowed here. 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.739
 The task of the Green Bank telescope is actually very flexible, 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:50.690
 from looking at objects in the solar system 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.699
 to look at objects halfway through the universe and beyond. 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.019
 It was useful in discovering the molten core of Mercury. 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:01.979
 It helped solve a disagreement in astronomy, 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.040
 about the distance to a nearby star cluster. 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.250
 And that may sound a bit "worldly", 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.220
 but measuring distances is very difficult in astronomy. 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.440
 And one of the biggest projects the telescope is doing now, 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.260
 is also looking out for living things in space. 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:15.860
 It is called the Breakthrough Listen project, 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.480
 and it is a quest for extraterrestrial intelligence using the Green Bank telescope. 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.900
 and other establishments around the world. 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.170
 The Quiet Zone is roughly a rectangle 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:25.970
 about 160 km (100 mi) long and wide. 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:27.290
 And since 1958 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:31.590
 the US government has strict restrictions on radiation transmissions within the Zone. 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.600
 Partly for this telescope, and partly because there is a much more secure military base 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.040
 50 km (30 mi) away is listening to earth communication. 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.380
 Some people write about the Quiet Zone 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.840
 and say that all radiation transmissions within 290 km (100 mi) are prohibited, 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.300
 but that is not true: there are cities within the Zone, 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.040
 and the people there use wifi and mobile phones. 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.300
 It is the Quiet Zone, not the Quiet Zone. 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:56.170
 Outside of these, the rules are about big channels, 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:58.150
 the kind that broadcasts TV and radio signals: 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.650
 they must use targeted low-energy antennas, 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.900
 instead of sending the signal everywhere. 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.710
 Within 16 km (10 mi) from here, 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.289
 the rules become stricter. 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.670
 This telescope is sensitive enough to 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.039
 if it is in the right direction, 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.610
 pick up a signal with the same energy as a snowflake that touches the ground. 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.469
 And even if it is not directly aimed at you, 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:20.140
 it has an area of ​​8000 m2 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.310
 to hear your telephone calling for cell towers that are not there. 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.650
 If you live in a place without a mobile phone, that is an interesting change. 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.680
 I had a mobile phone two years ago, 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.400
 I could look up everything on Google. 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.569
 You know, after living a week here ... 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.470
 I did not even remember it. 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.260
 The only difference is that you have to plan things a bit more forward. 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.189
 If you want to go out with your friends, you plan ahead 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:46.400
 or you say "I'll see them when I see them". 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:47.569
 Those kind of things. 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.260
 And many, many people have come and gone, 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.790
 stayed for weeks or months at a time, 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.370
 and none of them ever said "man, I really miss my phone". 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.110
 In the nearby city of Green Bank, everything that sends is 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.760
 whether it's a baby monitor or a wireless doorbell, forbidden. 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.340
 Just like anything that can cause interference. 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.840
 Microwaves are not allowed. 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.200
 Power cables must be buried more than a meter under the ground. 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.000
 The buildings in the vicinity of the telescope are giant Faraday cages, 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.640
 that keep all radiation inside. 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.040
 This is the dead room I'm testing. 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:23.760
 I first test the device myself to see what the radiations are, 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.029
 then I design a box for it, put it back in the room, 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:29.760
 and I see if I have done well or not. 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.290
 Things like cameras, for example, 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.120
 should see high-frequency electromagnetic radiation, namely light, 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:47.739
 and yet we try to prevent them from emitting electromagnetic radiation with lower energy. 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.049
 Normally we use a kind of net in glass that works fine 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:57.549
 and it does not disturb the picture so much. 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.239
 If you are within 1.6 km of the telescope, 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:02.799
 the restrictions are so severe that only diesel cars are allowed. 

00:04:02.799 --> 00:04:08.040
 Normal petrol cars cause too much interference from the spark plugs. 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.409
 People who say they are hypersensitive to move here: 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.919
 and even though every proof says it's in between the ears, 

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:18.090
 they still feel better when they are here. 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.310
 However, the scientists have some practical objections. 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.370
 My work is about dealing with radio frequency perturbations on location, 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.410
 and also routine reminders to see if there is something new in the area. 

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.250
 We have a measuring station at the location, 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.819
 and then we jump into the car. 

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:38.310
 And we have equipment in the car to find the way. 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:42.930
 We look at the receiver and the spectrum analyzer 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.480
 and drive around and watch changes of the signal. 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.050
 It's getting harder and harder, 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.199
 because more and more wireless stuff is coming. 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:53.860
 The wireless spirit is out of the bottle. 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:55.900
 And there are so many things out there, 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.319
 the Internet of Things sneaks into almost every device. 

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:02.880
 Fridges now have hotspots. 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.490
 If we drive around and watch wifi points, 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.629
 there are always three or four printers. 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:13.580
 The strangest thing that has been heard was an electric pillow in a doghouse. 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.169
 There were some sparks in the pillow, 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:17.889
 and that caused a lot of radio frequency disruptions, so ... 

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.669
 My predecessor liked that, 

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:26.349
 and they solved it by giving that man a new doghouse heating! 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:28.600
 I want everyone at the Green Bank Observatory 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.660
 and thank all the staff at the radio telescope. 

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:33.409
 I'm overwhelmed that I can be here, 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:35.360
 I am so grateful to everyone, 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:36.430
 and please look in the description, 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:37.339
 and view the links, and see what they do.
