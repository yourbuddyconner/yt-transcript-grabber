00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.700
 **Pewdiepie original opening ** 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.260
 YO, everyone, I just found out that I was adopted! 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:13.480
 (* ́▽`*) 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:20.480
 Double is the beginning~~ 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.320
 YO, everyone, I just found out that my mom is gay (・∩・)???? 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.900
 And the pair came to Pewds and said: God. (╬ಠ益ಠ) 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.260
 YO, everyone, ah, ah, ah, _( ́ཀ`" ∠)_ Warning: Turn the volume down quickly!!!!!!!!! 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.180
 The same beginning and both come to the www. Is this really the beginning of Pewds? ಠ_ರೃ 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.060
 Is Ali-A gay? (Almost) 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.560
 I think this is a good time to answer this question. 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.960
 So the answer you want to know is ~YES!!!! 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.400
 "And the doubles are the same beginning" "Different BGM" 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.200
 YO, everyone, today we are going to do another fan feedback. 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.960
 We have to send 5,000 V coins. 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.390
 The thing to do to win this fan feedback is to like the button. 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.540
 Subscribe to me and reply below: Declaration of Independence 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.000
 Play backwards (* ́▽`*) 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.820
 The condition 94 of participation is so simple, let's start this video. 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.740
 "And the eyes are the same beginning" "Music hodgepodge" 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.500
 A few weeks ago, I made a fortite film, but this 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.720
 Basically nothing changed. 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.980
 It is still the same. 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.600
 The hot status of the Youtube e-sports series is still very...ㄜ (unsure) 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.320
 Pewds is cute, ah ah * (* ́▽`*) 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:20.320
吼喔喔喔喔喔喔♂~~~~ (゚ρ゚*) 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.320
哼 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 嗯 ♂ (⊙_☉) 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.000
 Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh oh. (ʘдʘ╬) 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.840
 Hey, ah, oh, oh, ah, ah, ah, ♂♂♂♂ (ʘдʘ╬)(ʘдʘ╬)(ʘдʘ╬)(ʘдʘ╬) 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.060
 Abomination and evil....(⊙ꇴ⊙) (I have already read the translation w) 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.500
 I love his video thumbnails 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.440
 Awesome 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.220
 All in all, this is a thumbnail of the girly movie. 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.340
 I know that you are thinking.. 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.220
 Pewdiepie, you will only acid Ali-A because he has more views than you. 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.320
 Listen, I am very happy for my man Ali-A. 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.800
 I am very happy to see 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.980
 Videos with "content" can flourish on Youtube 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.520
 Ok, his movie is best seen. 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.640
 There is a film in his channel called Superman Challenge. 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.560
 Wow!!! Is there a superman in Fortnite?! I better spend 25 minutes watching this video to find 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.780
 This is how I deal with him.... 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.780
 This is me...how to... 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.340
 Did you see it?? [x3] This is right [x2] Don't move! [x2] 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:10.940
 bump! 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.400
 Hey!! Hey!!!!! Hey!! I-dead? 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.600
 We did it, we have completed this challenge! 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:17.620
 That’s really fun欸

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.400
 If you have more challenges, reply to me under the film (don't) 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.980
 Ok.. I guess there should be no Superman inside. 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.740
 Shih-what?? Flash in Fortnite?! 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.280
 No, not at all 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.520
 Hulk?! Hulk in Fortnite?! I have to spend 22 minutes and 35 seconds to see!! 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.240
 Brother, he really is not tempting you to see it. 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.160
 The thumbnail of the film is indeed 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.040
 Reflecting that the content in the film is correct. 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.880
 Just like 100% of my videos are expressing my content in thumbnails. 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.920
 The most recent title on the Fortnite game video is... "What's in it?" 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.560
 The title is down: You have an idea/thing and then add: What is inside?? 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.040
 A game company sent a free gift?! There is a gift in the gift??? 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.000
 Hey, I’d better open this video to see what’s inside! 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.820
 Ah ゚ ( ゚ρ ゚) 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.740
 What is inside?? I must know what is inside! What do they send me? (⊙_☉) 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.500
 And why should it take 21 minutes to reveal? 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.640
 Did you see it? This is the answer. 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.640
 In fact, I have already put on the suit glider. 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.239
 I got the suit glider in the gift and set it as the main look. 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.880
 This is great, let's speed up. 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.700
 Use this new set of clothes and continue to work hard to challenge it (a bunch of dry words) 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:27.420
 If you like the gift package, give us a new suit. 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.100
 Needless to say, help me press a compliment 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.579
 Let's take a look at these new suits. 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.240
 Let us also take a look and try to use this new dice to win the game. 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.160
 If you like anything at any point in your life 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:39.600
 Press this movie now~~~😂😂😂 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.600
 If we come to discuss the title of "What's Inside?" 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.880
 Look here and read: "I opened the mysterious bunker!!!! What's inside?" 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.800
 I only care about what is hidden in Ali-A's hat!! 😂😂😂 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:48.460
 He - because - 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:50.780
 Because in every film he carries, he wears that hat. 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:53.300
 He must hide something under his hat 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.680
 Hehehe.. What will it be? 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.060
 I actually have some ideas, but I don't want to say W ̄V( ̄∇ ̄)V ̄ 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.200
 Like us in the underground bunker 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.440
 We are in this basement.. 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.640
 *** But it seems that there is nothing worth watching...*** 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.100
 Pewds: Right, just like all your videos~~~ 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.160
 % % % % % wow hahahahaha 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.680
 I caught you Ali! Haha 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.960
 I know that you all think: 喔 This is just for kids. 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.200
 Ali-A’s film is for kids, so this is why he is so red. 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:28.720
 Sorry, the way you know about Ali-A is different from mine. 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.360
 He posted some fever content on Youtube (see Pewds' face to know why this is the case) 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.360
 I feel that he is inside. 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.380
 Hurry up~ 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.240
 Enter ♂ Enter ♂ 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.880
 Go in, go in, ♂♂♂ 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.000
 Well done (Pewds: 喔吼吼♂) 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.340
 Let's destroy it in more ways. 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:44.600
 *Cute ㄉPewds laughter* 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:53.660
 Ali-A: Five blocks, shouldn't be six, etc. Suppose he is now five kills... If he kills another person 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:05:02.380
 Math problem 

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.540
 That means... 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.320
 A... *** and double eyes are the beginning of this day *** 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.840
 Just kidding, I think the Ali-A people look good. 

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.900
 We are just kidding, kidding, this is just a joke. 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.220
 I saw that many people are ashamed because 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.885
 How much his content is waste and both are old stalks 

00:05:20.885 --> 00:05:21.530
 I do not know 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:26.060
 If you go to see Ali-A's Twitter, you will find that everyone is constantly snoring. 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.020
 Who cares? This is just a game. 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.840
 If you compare the content of Ali-A videos with other videos on Youtube 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.760
 Honestly, it’s really the worst one. I think his unpleasantness may be because 

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:44.900
 He is one of the big tails of the live master, so I feel a bit sacred Ali, I just think... you really are... oh... 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:50.060
 I can't praise people for being too strange to me. 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.260
 But some people are really hot on the content of those Fortnite 

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:56.040
 I am very angry 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.780
 A bunch of fortite pieces that lure you into clicking to see me can't sleep well. 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.820
 These creators make these scraps for the number of views. 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.120
 They don't care what we see, he only has to watch 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:15.340
 I just don't understand 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:22.320
 I can't understand all this. It makes me feel like I am like an alien. 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.660
 *擤擤* 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.500
 *sigh* 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:32.300
 Thank God, we have these brave people like Drift0r stand up and criticize these fortite scraps. 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.000
 this person 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.650
 Absolutely saint ww 

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:41.340
 Finally, some people have criticized the waste film of Fortnite with a serious attitude. 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.820
 I just want to see a really nice Fortnite movie. 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.880
 But there are a lot of waste sheets that make the topic and have no focus everywhere... 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.580
 What should I do? 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.980
 Now let's take a look at the content of the ninja. 

00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.600
 First place Fortnite live master 

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.500
 Like.. Warning: Turn down the sound 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.840
 Don't bully anyone warning: turn down the sound 

00:06:57.140 --> 00:06:59.480
 You X just said to me what you kid! 

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:01.840
 * Mentally retarded laughter* 

00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.980
 Why didn't he X attend classes at school?? 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.540
 Are you using your dirty mouth to kiss your mother? 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.760
 Are you X using your dirty mouth to kiss your mother? (nonsense) 

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:10.900
蛤? (蛤尛) 

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.500
 Then why didn't you go to school at school? *Laugh* 

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.000
 You are like asking all your audience 

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.750
 Innocent victims: We live in colleges* laugh* 

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.750
 [Intelligent laughter] *** Headphone users please rest in *** 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.740
 You shut me up when I spoke! You close my mouth to me! [You shut me up] 

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:29.860
 Don't laugh at anyone 

00:07:29.860 --> 00:07:32.380
 XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD 

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:35.860
 You can think about some people who are like this. It doesn't matter. 

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:36.900
 So ridicule is not good. 

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.760
 The fart child is going to die [just turn around and sneeze] 

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:40.400
 You are adopted. 

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:51.680
 Not sure what Pewds means 

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.400
 % % % % % 

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:00.200
 The ninja is obviously not as good and good as he said, although the film is a bit unfair. 

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:03.620
 But it’s really funny to compare the old movies he shot before. 

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.720
 I used to be really good in the past. I don’t want to mention it. 

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.280
 I am just kidding, don’t look too serious. 

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.440
 I believe he will laugh when he sees it. 

00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.400
 By the way!!!! Do you know that Thanos is actually in fortite!!!!!! 

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:22.020
 Ah, ah, ah, ah ah oh 

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:32.580
 Thanos is actually in fortite!! When the two things that I hate most, they are loved!! 

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:35.560
 Just hate me, thank you, I am very grateful. 

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.800
喔~喔Thanos was arrested 

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.480
 I guess the second part of the Avengers has been cancelled. 

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:43.620
 Sorry, kids: No Thanos. 

00:08:43.940 --> 00:08:47.074
 Just like there is no Alia-A kind of Fortnite movie with no content. 

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:49.020
 Now he deleted fortite 

00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:50.720
 According to the reading: This makes Ali-A 

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:52.960
 Remove fortite 

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:59.680
 He claimed to be a third person to delete the game to attract people to watch? It is so smart!!!!!! 

00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.020
 ** sad music ** 

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:11.380
 No~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.420
 No~~~~~ 

00:09:14.420 --> 00:09:18.040
 Who will waste 25 minutes every day in my ~~~~~~~~ 

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:19.420
 Can ~ evil~ 

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.320
 Let's see what Summit will do. 

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.960
 I am dying of his X [X2] 

00:09:23.020 --> 00:09:23.700
 I want to... Ha 

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.380
 I can't do anything now... 

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:31.420
 I want to go offline. 

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:32.740
 This kind of... 

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:38.640
 You don't think that this kind of big escape type of game can really bring out the gentlest face of humanity. 

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:41.420
 Anyway, I don’t care anyway. 

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.880
 Because I have never given such a strong emotional reaction* PUBG, I forgot about it XD* 

00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:51.660
 I am not so sad to play any game that will not happen to me. 

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.960
 That screaming player is 

00:09:54.129 --> 00:09:58.380
 EQ is so low that the child can control my emotions and make me crazy 

00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:00.320
 Absolutely not going to happen? 

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:02.020
 I have mentioned... 

00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.960
 Thanos actually appears in Fortnite!! 

00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:05.760
 Mad dab *dab* *dab* 

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:08.480
 YAAAA!!! 

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.620
 My old swan 

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:13.900
 If you like Thanos appearing in Fortnite then just like it. 

00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.799
 You may have seen this meme but this is still very funny XD 

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:22.769
 There is also a man here who really wants to use the striptease concept as a concept. 

00:10:22.769 --> 00:10:30.020
 He said this, oh, I can use my 13-year-old sister to naked in the film to show the audience of Youtube. 

00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:32.260
 Great, it’s a good way 

00:10:32.460 --> 00:10:35.120
 Basically, I am going to play Fortnite with my 13-year-old sister. 

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.540
 If I kill someone, she must take off a dress. 

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:39.320
 one day later 

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:43.280
 I understand the definition of child pornography and why it is illegal. 

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:45.620
 But in my opinion, I don't think this is child pornography (hi X's mental retardation) 

00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.620
 "I don't think this is child pornography~" Do you understand what I mean [X2] 

00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:52.840
 Do you understand what I mean?! 

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:57.240
 "About government and government laws" 

00:10:57.920 --> 00:11:00.700
 "Prohibited and blocked" 

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.840
 "For example, Fortnite has a minimum age of 12 years old." 

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:07.200
 Fortnite is now a parent issue, they even put forward 

00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.880
 a government ban 

00:11:08.880 --> 00:11:10.260
 Really a good idea 

00:11:10.260 --> 00:11:11.420
 Thank you fortite 

00:11:11.580 --> 00:11:13.080
 I am not a pedophile *** Are you sure? I am worried about your sister's future *** 

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:15.360
 This is really weird 

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:20.740
 This is reality. This is the reality of YouTube games for Fortnite. 

00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:21.780
 Thank you 喔Fortnite 

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:26.340
 If you want to find a better game than Fortnite 

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:29.840
 Take a look at a game called Animal Super Squad!! May 15 will be released!! 

00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:31.360
 Hooray! 

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.440
 The orange is very rich in the proportion of vitamin C. *Yes*
