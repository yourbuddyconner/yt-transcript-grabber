00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.435
 Good morning everyone (Imitate Jacksepticeye) 

00:00:02.435 --> 00:00:06.239
 Today is the only day we can enjoy in the UK. 

00:00:06.239 --> 00:00:08.141
 So I decided 

00:00:08.141 --> 00:00:12.345
 I am going to shoot Vlog and let myself leave the computer desk. 

00:00:13.246 --> 00:00:15.749
 I am wearing shorts 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:16.983
 I know 

00:00:16.983 --> 00:00:17.984
 very nice 

00:00:17.984 --> 00:00:23.590
 Marzia has always wanted to buy the inflatable pool of children for a long time. 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.227
 I think that is pretty ruby ​​but it sounds good. 

00:00:27.227 --> 00:00:28.261
 Marzia: What did you say?! 

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:31.898
 So today we are going to buy a swimming pool. 

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:34.300
 Really enjoy the summer in the UK 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.471
 I am afraid that you do not know that this is my temporary equipment. 

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:41.708
 Now I am in the place of vacation. 

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:45.979
 This is almost the same as the equipment I bought for Japan. 

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:48.682
 All can be loaded in the box 

00:00:48.682 --> 00:00:50.250
 ~ Equipment introduction ~ 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.487
 This is the camera I bought in Japan. 

00:00:54.487 --> 00:00:59.192
 This is a 4K camera so why do you sometimes see my pores? 

00:00:59.959 --> 00:01:03.463
 I am afraid that some people will be curious that this is a recording device. 

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:08.100
 I usually see a lot of walls on the YouTuber that have one square. 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.704
 The problem is that you have to spray super glue to stick it. 

00:01:10.704 --> 00:01:14.841
 My previous equipment has also been used. 

00:01:14.841 --> 00:01:18.411
 Once you stick to the wall, you can never get it down. 

00:01:18.411 --> 00:01:19.913
 I don't want to ask for trouble anymore. 

00:01:19.913 --> 00:01:22.282
 Then I use these babies 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.884
 See who this is? 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.422
 How do you sleep in this dog bed? 

00:01:29.422 --> 00:01:30.757
 Oh... 

00:01:32.492 --> 00:01:34.627
 Edgar: I love you Felix~ 

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.397
 Edgar: I also love your chicken. 

00:01:37.697 --> 00:01:39.366
 Do you want to see something cute? 

00:01:39.699 --> 00:01:41.167
 Edgar: Ok, shoot it~ 

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.350
 Not Edgar is not you. 

00:01:43.703 --> 00:01:44.804
 come 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.609
 Maya thank you for helping me clean 

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.811
 Hahaha 

00:01:52.912 --> 00:01:54.280
掰~ 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.510
 Oh, sorry, sorry. 

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:03.123
 Hey, do you think who always wants to attract attention? 

00:02:03.656 --> 00:02:07.594
 I found out how the vacuum cleaner will run there? 

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:10.663
 Which one do we want to choose? 

00:02:10.663 --> 00:02:12.966
 Marzia: It seems that there is only this choice. 

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.735
 In fact, I think it should be OK. 

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:16.770
 Marzia: No 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.339
 How about this fighter version? 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:20.940
 Marzia: Wait a minute, there is another thing. 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.509
 This looks so bad 

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:25.945
 OK, let's buy Marzia: Ok. 

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.982
 My God, Marzia, you made a mess. 

00:02:31.184 --> 00:02:32.352
 My goodness 

00:02:33.687 --> 00:02:35.655
 This is me then this is you 

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.230
 Marzia: Engen 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.857
 can not wait anymore 

00:02:37.857 --> 00:02:39.559
 Marzia: It's me and Edgie (Edgar) and Puga. 

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:43.229
 My god, two calm points. 

00:02:45.198 --> 00:02:47.233
 I forgot to buy a pumping bucket. 

00:02:48.902 --> 00:02:50.103
 Edgar, are you going to blow it for me? 

00:02:50.904 --> 00:02:53.807
 I even remember that I still remember to buy an inflatable bucket in the store. 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.480
 So if I let the waterbed 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:03.817
 I mean this stuff that is inflated to hold water. 

00:03:03.817 --> 00:03:05.552
 Fill it with water? 

00:03:05.985 --> 00:03:06.853
 Hmmmmmmm 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.322
 You know that Bill Gates has a famous saying. 

00:03:09.322 --> 00:03:12.926
 He said he would rather hire a lazy ghost 

00:03:12.926 --> 00:03:17.230
 Because they always come up with smarter ways to solve problems 

00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:19.833
 We just do it 

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:23.136
 That’s right, as you can see, everything is fine. 

00:03:23.136 --> 00:03:25.672
 Marzia, we are in trouble. 

00:03:25.672 --> 00:03:30.677
 This robot is a hassle to go and leave Marzia: No!!!!!! Marzia: Ah? 

00:03:30.677 --> 00:03:32.145
 Go somewhere else 

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:34.800
 Good to control the camera 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.517
 Oh, it’s coming back to come to me for revenge. 

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:39.686
 do not hurt me 

00:03:39.686 --> 00:03:42.188
 To be honest, I will be afraid 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.359
 Right, don’t stop, don’t stop. 

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:51.197
 Since you can swim next to the water, why swim in the water? 

00:03:51.197 --> 00:03:54.734
 Marzia, I found one thing. 

00:03:55.902 --> 00:03:58.171
 Filled up for so long... 

00:03:58.171 --> 00:03:59.839
 Marzia: What!? What!! 

00:03:59.839 --> 00:04:01.408
 Why is there a hole here? 

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:06.813
 So it seems that I have been pouring water into the hole that is used to drain the water. 

00:04:06.813 --> 00:04:07.580
 whatever 

00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:20.326
 I am honored to let Bill Gates see this scene. 

00:04:20.827 --> 00:04:22.529
 Come to fill the water, baby! 

00:04:22.929 --> 00:04:23.997
 You are not allowed! 

00:04:29.836 --> 00:04:30.503
 Do not 

00:04:30.503 --> 00:04:34.740
 Edgar is afraid of water 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.843
 But I think it is just afraid of the waves 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.412
 Is this your favorite song? Marzia: That's right. 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.917
 Marzia: I feel good about me 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:47.787
 Marzia: Very nice! 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.257
 Marzia: Don't shoot it. 

00:04:53.193 --> 00:04:56.296
 Ok, we have to come, though only a little bit. 

00:04:56.296 --> 00:04:59.320
 Is it a bad idea to go into the hot water? 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.100
 Marzia: No! It should be fine. 

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:04.237
 You know that the YouTubers pool is quite big. 

00:05:05.238 --> 00:05:06.506
 And I am like this 

00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:09.876
喔~ Very good~ 

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:14.981
 Please add more water, thank you. 

00:05:14.981 --> 00:05:19.152
 The best moment for the whole girlfriend will definitely be wonderful. 

00:05:19.152 --> 00:05:20.987
 My goodness 

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:25.525
 It seems pretty cool, you see 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.628
 Like a little chest 

00:05:28.628 --> 00:05:31.364
 Very cool, look at you. 

00:05:34.267 --> 00:05:35.802
 You 

00:05:36.369 --> 00:05:38.171
 what!!!!!!!! 

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.407
 You... bad! 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.644
 I have a whole barrel of bullets here, you know? 

00:05:44.644 --> 00:05:46.460
 Have I lost you? 

00:05:46.646 --> 00:05:47.647
 How was it lost? 

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:49.849
 I lost your ass? Marzia: Right! 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:51.685
 Hey, now I know how the title of this film is going. 

00:05:51.685 --> 00:05:54.287
嘿Maya 嘿Maya Marzia: Don't... 

00:05:54.287 --> 00:05:57.157
 She can't see her getting worse and worse. 

00:05:57.157 --> 00:05:58.910
嘿Maya! 

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.295
 Good next 

00:06:03.897 --> 00:06:05.999
 Hahahahahahahaha 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:08.768
 Is it difficult to pick up? You usually pick up it. 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:10.870
 Very slippery? 

00:06:11.638 --> 00:06:12.872
 No, no, no, no, no 

00:06:13.239 --> 00:06:14.974
 It’s hard to be 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:24.851
 Ok, now the water should be warmer. 

00:06:26.119 --> 00:06:27.487
 Well, actually. 

00:06:27.754 --> 00:06:28.722
 We are about to shoot 

00:06:28.722 --> 00:06:31.324
 Marzia: This is great, I said it. 

00:06:31.324 --> 00:06:34.194
 We are going to help Mariza take pictures. 

00:06:34.194 --> 00:06:35.362
 What do you mean by you? 

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:38.164
 Ma zza zas?? 

00:06:42.836 --> 00:06:45.438
 Do you know that I used to be the best goalkeeper? 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.475
 what!!!! 

00:06:54.481 --> 00:06:55.882
 My child~ 

00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:01.210
 Edgar loves to play with water 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:01.688
 Right, Edgar? 

00:07:01.688 --> 00:07:02.555
 (help me) 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.662
 He wants to escape 

00:07:12.799 --> 00:07:14.501
 Not bad 

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.700
 correct 

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:18.505
 Not terrible 

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:24.844
 Want to hold Maya in? 

00:07:31.651 --> 00:07:33.953
 She will float up, she is so fat 

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.322
 Hey, wait for her to stand up Marzia: What are you talking about? 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.159
乖 girl 乖 girl 

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:40.393
 Marzia: She won't be afraid 

00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:43.296
 Marzia: You are so cute. 

00:07:43.296 --> 00:07:44.964
 Edgar, do you want to play again? 

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:52.138
 Maya: How do I get out? 

00:07:52.138 --> 00:07:54.274
 Maya: I don't like it. 

00:07:54.274 --> 00:07:56.142
 Maya: Take me out of this human. 

00:07:59.779 --> 00:08:02.349
 My God, he is crazy, what happened to him? 

00:08:03.183 --> 00:08:04.451
 caught you! 

00:08:09.890 --> 00:08:12.592
 Edgar: What happened? Ok, now you have to shoot slow motion, this is definitely super wonderful. 

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:38.885
 You can't see it, but I am very badly sunburned. I feel it. 

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.655
 very good 

00:08:42.655 --> 00:08:45.859
 Very good 

00:08:45.859 --> 00:08:48.610
 Oh...yeah~ 

00:08:48.610 --> 00:08:50.797
 I don't know if it is an albinism insect? 

00:08:50.797 --> 00:08:52.432
 Or is it just a graffiti on the wall? 

00:08:52.432 --> 00:08:54.601
 I have never seen it before. 

00:08:54.601 --> 00:08:57.971
 I can't believe you found it. Are you a freak? 

00:08:57.971 --> 00:09:03.910
 Good good guy, good, nothing, nothing. 

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:06.112
 I think you have to take it? Let it go? 

00:09:11.451 --> 00:09:12.352
 Ewww 

00:09:13.787 --> 00:09:15.588
 It doesn't quite fly 

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:21.995
 Buggy adventure with PewDiePie and Marzia 

00:09:21.995 --> 00:09:23.263
 Caterpillar 

00:09:23.263 --> 00:09:27.670
 Marzia Do you think I have a way to nail it to the wall? 

00:09:35.475 --> 00:09:38.678
 I am afraid that you are curious and everything is going well. 

00:09:38.678 --> 00:09:41.981
 Everything went well but Marzia felt that I was not nailed straight enough 

00:09:42.382 --> 00:09:43.283
 but 

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:47.887
 Nothing is perfect, this is not my fault. 

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:49.656
 I screwed up everyone, I messed up. 

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:52.492
 Good TV on the wall 

00:09:52.492 --> 00:09:55.729
 Heite has to say that P is going up. 

00:09:55.729 --> 00:09:56.663
 What do you think of Edgar? 

00:09:57.864 --> 00:10:00.567
 If you need me to nail TV for you 

00:10:00.567 --> 00:10:03.360
 My service includes installation services 

00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:08.800
 YouTube’s income is too low, so please 

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.244
 If you can give a tip, you are too grateful. 

00:10:11.244 --> 00:10:12.579
 No matter how far I am willing 

00:10:12.579 --> 00:10:14.714
 Coffee can also be transnational 

00:10:14.714 --> 00:10:19.586
 Install TV at a cheap price as long as 399 

00:10:19.652 --> 00:10:21.521
 Now has passed the climax of the film. 

00:10:21.521 --> 00:10:24.591
 Nothing will be more interesting than installing TV. 

00:10:24.591 --> 00:10:26.459
 There is nothing better to shoot. 

00:10:26.459 --> 00:10:31.531
 I will wait to read &lt;Starship Warfare&gt; 

00:10:31.531 --> 00:10:34.501
 It’s not very good to watch movies, but I like it very much. 

00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:38.538
 A great day off, thank you for your company. 

00:10:38.538 --> 00:10:42.175
 I hope you like this Vlog. If you still want to watch Vlog. 

00:10:42.175 --> 00:10:44.544
 Do you know what you should do 

00:10:44.544 --> 00:10:47.547
 You have to press it, don’t like it. 

00:10:47.547 --> 00:10:50.160
 On this channel we have to reverse the operation 

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.619
 We are different, we are more powerful, we are amazing. 

00:10:52.819 --> 00:10:54.587
 Please, please, please, joking.
