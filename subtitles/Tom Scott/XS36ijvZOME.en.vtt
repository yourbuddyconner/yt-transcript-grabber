00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
 I am in one of the highest wind parks in Europe. 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.240
 Look! Are not they great? 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.240
 Maybe you do not realize it, but actually, 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.040
 when the clouds pass over, that it is so high 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.000
 that it creates a shadow on the cloud as it passes by. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.700
 But the reason why I am here is because you may not know, 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.700
 that's why, 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.220
 if it is windy wind farms are not always on. 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.520
 And there are a number of reasons 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.000
 One, is that windmills are not built for such extreme wind forces. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.160
 Above 80-90 km / h it starts to become dangerous 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.440
 and this beauty could go broke. 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.880
 So they brake it at high wind speeds 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.880
 and he stops turning, 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.880
 Because the amount of energy you would lose by doing that 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.460
 is much less than the number of energy that you would constantly lose 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.620
 if you should build this thing 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.380
 to be able to wind against hurricane force. 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.640
 The other reason is that the national electricity grid 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.300
 can not stand that so much energy 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.300
 produced. 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.440
 There are no gigantic storage batteries 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.600
 that can hold the all incoming power. 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.300
 So what happens; 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.300
 if the demand is low 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.940
 then they turn off the ones 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.520
 that are easy to switch off. 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.180
 And if the demand rises again, 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.780
 then they switch on these and hydroelectric power stations again 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.060
 to deal with direct demand. 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.580
 Nuclear, coal, gas 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.320
 are much harder to turn off, 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.240
 and to turn back on. 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.440
 And therefore, the national power grid keeps us balanced at 50 Hertz-- 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.820
 50 cycles per second, 60 in America, 50 in Britain-- 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.200
 by checking installations like this, 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.200
 and switch them on and off 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.660
 when it is needed. 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.940
 And that is something you may not have known. 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.700
