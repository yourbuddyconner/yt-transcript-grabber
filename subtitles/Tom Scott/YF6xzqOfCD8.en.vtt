00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.679
 This is a story that goes back more than 700 years, 

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:05.960
 and the best way to start is with a 16th-century joke: 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.060
 "A man drove to the market with two grain of grain. 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:10.950
 But because his horse could not carry a heavy load, 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.540
 he carried the grain on his own shoulders, on the back of the horse. " 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.150
 It may not be the best 16th century joke. 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.509
 But it is one of the Merry Tales of the Mad-Men or Gotam, 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:22.589
 a 16th century collection of stories 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.420
 who will take away the intelligence of the inhabitants of this village. 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.460
 You pronounce the name as "gutter-um". 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.239
 The jokes in this book have existed for centuries, 

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.470
 and despite the fact that years of retelling has changed the details, 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.940
 the story goes like this: 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.010
 Early in the thirteenth century King John - wanted 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.050
 the King John from the Robin Hood stories - 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.370
 traveling through this village. 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.880
 The residents were worried, because if the king traveled on a road, 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.180
 it would become a public highway. They did not want this. 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.660
 Another version tells of a hunting lodge that the king wanted to build in the neighborhood, 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.030
 where the bill would come to lie with the residents. 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.700
 So every royal ambassador who visited Gotham saw the villagers doing something ridiculous. 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.300
 They tried to catch a cuckoo by building a hedge around it, 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.829
 and decided, when the bird flew away, 

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.140
 that they had not built the hedge high enough. 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.409
 They tried to kill an eel by drowning him. 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.259
 At that time, "madness" was seen as contagious. 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.429
 If the King would come here, 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:19.829
 he might also be infected. 

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:22.960
 The king stayed away, and the villagers won. 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.270
 The legend describes a cunning group of people who outwitted the King ... 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.229
 but because of this also became known as a village full of crazy people. 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.499
 They were both the Wise Men of Gotham and the Fools of Gotham. 

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:39.960
 Centuries later, in the 19th century, there was an American writer named Washington Irving. 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.290
 People now know him mainly as the writer of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow, 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.509
 but he was also a satirist. 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.490
 In one of his early works he gives New York City the nickname Gotham. 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.079
 I have traced this work, but I can not understand it very much. 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.619
 I miss the complete context. 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.130
 I do not know whether he calls the people of New York smart, or foolish, or both. 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.049
 But the nickname he gave New York remained in public consciousness - 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.130
 and it was written language, so "Goot-um" became "Goth-am". 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.670
 More than a century later, when the comic book writer Bill Finger 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.189
 searched for a name for the fictional city of Batman, 

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:15.230
 he went through the New York City phone book. 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.840
 His eye fell on "Gotham Jewelers", and he thought: this is perfect. 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.590
 That's why we now have Gotham City. 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.849
 If one step had been missed, 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.650
 from 13th-century legends to a 16th-century joke book, 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.629
 to a 19th-century writer, to leaves in a 20th-century telephone book, 

00:02:31.629 --> 00:02:34.739
 if one of these trifles had not happened, 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.590
 Batman had now lived elsewhere.
