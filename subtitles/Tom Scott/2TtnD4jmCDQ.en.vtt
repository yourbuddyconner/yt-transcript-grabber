00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.680
 Colors are easy, right? It is one of the first things you learn as a young child. Red, Orange, 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.689
 Yellow, green, blue, purple, white, black, gray, brown, pink. And then when you learn 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.650
 In other languages, all you have to do is learn new words that refer to the same colors. 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.900
 But this is not the case. This color scheme, which is in English, with its beautifully defined names, 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.269
 Do not move one by one into other languages. 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.970
 Quick disclaimer: I'm the most basic thing here. Look at the references if you want to 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.650
 Learn more details. 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.630
 The most common differences, or at least the most variability, are research 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.719
 The blue and green universe is two different colors, or two different degrees of the same color 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:38.890
 It is called the English guo, "Azzar". The Vietnamese language, for example, uses the same word or basic word 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:45.240
 For blue and green, so that it can literally be translated into a greener paper, or greener ocean 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.559
 Does this seem strange? It should not seem so, it's just a simple change, where you usually draw a line of difference 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.309
 On the circle of color grading. On the other hand, the Greeks did not classify colors 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.969
 Depending on the degree of color, but depending on the degree of illumination. So they had one word, a single keyword, for blue, green, and dowakin structures 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.910
 And one word for the darkest greens, greens and greens 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.050
 We use one word, blue, for very different colors, but in Russian, there are two different words 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.920
 What we call blue is dark and light blue, and this should not seem so strange 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.570
 For English speakers, because this is exactly what we do with dark red and light red 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.890
 Or what we call it, pink 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.100
 In 1969, Brent Berlin and Paul Gai published a book claiming that they had followed a development 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.500
 Colors in languages. As Berlin said, the languages ​​begin only with words 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.610
 For cold dark colors and light hot colors, then gain a word for red, then green and yellow 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.490
 Then blue, brown, and the rest of what is called in English, the spectrum 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.200
 There is some debate about the accuracy of this, and with some controversy, I mean that really is 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.720
 A controversial subject in linguistics, and has remained for decades, I quickly browse the principles here 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.920
 But there are blocks of research that deal with deep-seated allegations 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:58.430
 I am not even qualified to discuss it, many linguists with impressive degrees 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.110
 They have very tough and highly divergent views about this 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.510
 Something as simple as color differences highlights how translation can be done 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.810
 And intercultural communication to be complex, and this argument goes deeper than this 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:15.630
 It looks at whether the words we know and the languages ​​we learn affect how we interpret them 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.630
 To the world, or reflect our current interpretations. Answer: I do not know, no one really knows 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.030
 Not yet. The answer may be somewhere between, because the language is complex 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.630
 People are complicated, and sometimes things are not just black or white 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.250
 I really need to write better verbal manipulations 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.660
