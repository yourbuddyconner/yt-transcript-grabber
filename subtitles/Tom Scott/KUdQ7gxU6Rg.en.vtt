00:00:03.769 --> 00:00:06.540
 Welcome to the United States of America, specifically from Los Angeles 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.450
 Welcome to the famous place (Bieb) 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:13.690
 Trademark rights are interesting 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.529
 You may know about copyright and how it is extended in America and Europe 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:22.910
 And always - oddly enough - before becoming the famous Mickey Mouse series 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.910
 Available for general use. But these are the nature of copyright, unlike trademark rights. And unlike those 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.960
 The animation, name and design of Mickey Mouse is recorded as a trademark. 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.060
 It 's something Disney uses to sell things ... very, very, very, very. So even if they are 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.030
 Those animations have gone beyond copyright control, I will not be able to sell my own Mickey Mouse items. 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.610
 In the same way that I can not open a shop called Wal-Mart and sell 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:52.260
 My own drink which I would call Coca-Cola. Trademarks related to these names do not have an expiry date 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.620
 As long as they are in use, companies defend them. 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.610
 The difference here is the commercial purpose, so this is the name of a back name 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.250
 Surely you know the shape of this label, it 's the most famous 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:08.969
 Landmarks in America, and you will be able to easily find pictures and videos of this brand in the Internet. 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:14.799
 Even videos of people climbing, and then chased by the police. 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:20.810
 But do I use it for commercial purposes by filming this video? I do not think so, because I use it 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.729
 Is just to describe it, something legal. But am I ready to risk it 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:30.850
 Lawsuits from the owners of this brand, financial offsets out of court dating back decades 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.340
 Now, could I have permission to shoot if I made some phone calls? Yes it is possible 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.329
 But they will probably ask me to pay a sum of money in exchange, and sign many papers 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:45.329
 Frankly, I am currently on holiday, can I file a lawsuit? Most likely, no. 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.389
 But am I 100% sure that the owners of the brand will not come to ask me to show you 

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:55.639
 One of the most famous landmarks in America? And I will not have to compromise 

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:59.509
 Outside the court for a fee, or to pay defense lawyers whose costs would be expensive? 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:02.939
 No, I'm not 100% 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.859
 This is the reason for the presence of rear fog pixels. 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:10.640
 I'm here in Los Angeles for several more days. If any of you are interested in video sharing 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.010
 From November 6th and 7th, they sent me an email. You will find details at the bottom of the screen. I do not have much 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.280
 Of time, but it would be nice to work with you, so please communicate if you are interested. 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.250
 Oh my God, that the sun is very shining here.
