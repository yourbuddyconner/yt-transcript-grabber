00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.990
 In 1961 Martin Joos, a linguist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, wrote "The Five Clocks", 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.900
 which describes five styles or registers of the use of English. Well, this system has not changed since 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.110
 Joos simply said so, even though it is a good introduction for a layman, do not take it 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.260
 as gospel. 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.700
 Joos presented five registers for English: Frozen, Formal, Advisory, Everyday and Intimate. 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.699
 Frozen is simple. These are quotes written in stone. For example from the Bible: "You 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.949
 will not kill. "That is frozen, frozen is what I do now, even if I use it deliberately 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.269
 some everyday words pauses to build a relationship with you, 

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.859
 the viewer. That probably does not work, but hey, I've tried it. Advisory is what can happen 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.929
 in a formal business appointment, or when there is information to transfer: no one assumes 

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.789
 foreknowledge. Everyday is friends in the pub: there are interruptions, inside jokes, and it is 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:52.979
 okay if you stammer a lot. And finally there is Intiem: the private language, including 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.809
 non-verbal signals that build up family members and very good friends. 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.370
 Everyone moves back and forth between these registers hundreds of times a day, without talking about it 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.240
 thinking. We instinctively know which register to use ... and if we do it wrong, 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.229
 then it is a recipe for shame. But what is interesting is that it is not just about 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.920
 how we talk. It's not just about using "I'm going to" instead of "Imma": it's about all 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.380
 words we use. 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.920
 The most obvious example of how registers change a language in English is in the names 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.920
 for meat. In 1066 the Normans invaded England and they generally spoke Norman or Picardian. 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.780
 Not that Picard. These were the languages ​​of what is now Western France. I am simplifying 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.979
 a lot here, but over the next few centuries they formed Anglo-Norman together with Anglo-Saxon, 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.049
 what was spoken by the nobility and the higher social classes, darling. So the people who 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.590
 The meat ate often referred to the food on their plate with the Anglo-Norman 'crook' 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.280
 - beef - while those who raised the animals referred to them with the Anglo-Saxon name: 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.159
 'cu'. 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.270
 You see that everywhere. The complicated words, the beautiful words, the words that are associated 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.109
 with respect and more formal registers - those words are more often of Norman origin 

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:05.759
 and sound French. A 'smell' is Anglo-Saxon, an 'odor' is French. If you order a 'drink', you are talking 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.660
 Anglo-Saxon. If you order a 'beverage', you speak French. Meanwhile, the Latin and Greek words - the 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.500
 words of the scholars - more often in more technical registers. 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.360
 And then you have scold. Brilliant, Anglo-Saxon swearing. Some Anglo-Saxon words for 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.660
 bodily functions were found rude when there were more refined French or Latin words 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.440
 who could describe the same less roughly. 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.200
 So, the chic words are French. The rough words are Anglo-Saxon. And we switch between the two 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.920
 and so many other things without thinking about it. The seeds of the linguistic class struggle 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.310
 were planted almost a millennium ago. 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.220
