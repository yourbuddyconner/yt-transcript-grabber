00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.230
 Behind me is Lake Constance. 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.170
 This lake is large, near the Alps, in the middle of Europe. 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.750
 This part of me exists in Germany, and this part of me, 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.420
 On the other side of the sculptor, in Switzerland. 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.420
 They removed the border fence and replaced it with a sculptor. 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.050
 A few miles behind, behind that horizon, is Austria. 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.340
 All three countries have a beach on Lake Constance. 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.850
 But if you look at the map, 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.550
 You'll notice something missing: 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.140
 Lines that indicate the international boundary, 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.390
 The lines I stand on now, stop at the beach. 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.559
 Lake Constance is a common sovereignty (condominium) 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:36.070
 It is a "luxury" way to say that it belongs to more than one country. 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.160
 But, no one is quite sure. 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:41.760
 We are accustomed to the idea that the land is divided, 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.850
 Different countries have different parts of them. 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.530
 And this thing is considered a bit strange, 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.920
 But since most of the world agrees, we cling to it. 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.370
 Laws, taxes, rights, and responsibilities change when formal lines are defined. 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.559
 Well, there are international waters, 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:00.699
 Antarctica is a special case, and there is a good part of Africa 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.350
 Where neither country wants to claim it, but generally: 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.990
 Each part of the land is owned by a particular state. 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.369
 Surely, sometimes borders are complicated by faults in treaties or land disputes, 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:15.790
 But this case is not any of the above. Quite simply, no one cared 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.840
 To make an international treaty at the border 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.689
 According to Austria, there, 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.819
 Lake Constance is a common common rule, 

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:27.020
 Equally shared between each of the three countries along the way. 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.649
 If you are on the lake, you are in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland at once. 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.829
 Switzerland is not happy about this: 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:39.280
 According to her, the border runs straight in the middle of the lake. 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.200
 Germany simply shakes her shoulders (I do not know / care) 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.600
 Actually, this thing does not cause anyone a problem. 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:44.850
 If there are any legal questions, 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.319
 Each case is resolved separately. 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:51.249
 So, if you're wondering what will happen if someone has a child in the middle of the lake, 

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:53.520
 And what will be the citizenship of his child, 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.980
 Or what will happen under the rescue laws (rescue ships) 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.260
 If someone pulled out a treasure drenched from the middle of the - 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.920
 I mean, the answer is: shoulder shake (I do not know / care) 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.119
 We will solve it when we are obliged to do so, 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.179
 In the meantime, no one would mind. 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.560
 The only people who will be affected by the lack of defined borders are cartographers: 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.000
 There is no option on most digital shoulder-shaking maps (I do not know / care). 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.919
 Computers and people do not know where to draw the line.
