00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.489
 ### This is an announcement from the Interstellar Security Council 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:08.980
 Your ship will soon enter an area where people have been seen before. 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:14.000
 We understand that there are speeches and myths of this kind. It is true that people are extremely dangerous, 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.310
 but we believe the best way to deal with them is to be aware of the facts. 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:25.269
 The human world, unlike other known planets, builds on the principle they call "Survival of the Strongest" 

00:00:25.269 --> 00:00:29.960
 For billions of years, since the first appearance of life, their world 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.200
 not co-operative but brutal, violent competition. 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.200
 People are driven by three things: 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:45.200
 First, people grow, recover, and feed on eating and digesting other forms of life, 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:51.270
 including macroscopic life and, in many cases, forms of life capable of reaction and fear. 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.520
 Their food input includes exoskeletal protrusions designed to crush, cut and tear almost every 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.080
 organic material. 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.800
 One once ate a flying machine. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.110
 People are symbiotic creatures. About 2% of their mass is the organisms they help 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.830
 their digestion, but which would kill them if they got to other parts of theirs 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.500
 internal structure. People, everything they make, and everything on theirs 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.200
 planet, is covered by an unpredictable amount of these creatures, and only one 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.000
 has ended catastrophically in some of our worlds. 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
 Unlike most species, human sensory organs are adapted to a wide range of terrestrial environments. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.770
 They can identify threats and prey by detecting atmospheric vibrations, 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.900
 using some electromagnetic frequencies, and chemical detection. Surprisingly they are immune 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.000
 to all magnetic fields, except the most powerful, 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 and all known hang-type type attacks. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.479
 People are able to perform many tasks at once. Many of them are able to operate 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.200
 automatically without thinking of their central mind. 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.000
 Most people are able to concentrate on more than one complicated task at a time. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.100
 They do not need to pause and think between actions, 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.100
 or to think about their further movement in a physical battle. 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:18.569
 They can control objects with incredible speed and accuracy by letting their bodies do it. 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.380
 Part of human recreation is physical violence, mental competition, targeted disruption 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:28.370
 their thought processes, and in some cases, deliberate entry into the potential 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.000
 deadly situations. 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.390
 People have weaknesses. 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.600
 The second thing they can not live with is oxygen. 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.200
 Highly flammable, highly corrosive, oxygen. 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.800
 Because of this they are able to live only on a limited number of terrestrial environments. 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.500
 They are also extremely prone to ionizing radiation, gravitational forces, and temperature changes. 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.400
 Therefore, their space travel requires great, complicated and fragile support for life. 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.400
 That's their weakness, and the right time to attack. 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:07.090
 Once they land on the planet with oxygen, it's theirs, and they win. 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.650
 And they win, because their most frightening capacity is self-deception. 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:19.000
 People are not rational creatures. They have no inborn understanding of statistics and probabilities. 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.920
 If they had, their history would be very different. 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.000
 More meaningful ways of space travel would follow than the insertion of their oxygen 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.400
 bodies into pressurized metal cans, and firing themselves from the surface of their planet. 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.950
 People are irrational, disorganized, opposed, and sometimes self-defeating. They act against the interests of one another, 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.300
 and competes in malicious and brutal ways with limited resources. 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:47.500
 Instead of doing as one, they make complicated tribes fighting each other. 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.000
 But people also have enormous capacity for desires, kinship, compassion, 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
 and ridiculous tolerance of adversity. 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.230
 Because of this, they are very dangerous and probably occupy a significant part 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.069
 galaxy in a very short time. 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.010
 Avoid them, if at all possible. 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:11.760
