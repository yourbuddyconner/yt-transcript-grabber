00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.000
 It is the day of fighting 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:16.940
 August 25th 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:18.800
 KSI vs. Logan 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 Deggie v. Jake 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.700
 Fighting will be in a few hours 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.700
 Logan Paul and Jake do a video explaining how you can watch it 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.300
 By credit card payment 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.900
 We'll write it off because ... you're hurt. 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.300
 Jagel, he's written off on the card, better than his slip on the body. 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.260
 Now, if you want to see fighting in this section, I have bad news for you 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.940
 Just hear from Jake himself 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.380
 If you think you'll be able to watch it for free later, you're wrong. 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.640
 Because there are people who will delete all the content that anyone else will upload 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.440
 So the only way to watch the fight is if you pay for watching. 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.940
 Do not worry, I'll tell you the result at the end of this video. 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.340
 I know everyone will die to know who wins. 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:01.720
 It's not like it does not matter. 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.140
 I will also give my expectations, about who I think he will win 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.840
 And I want him to win. 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.720
 But first. Let's re-watch the weight. 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:10.920
 This was done yesterday. 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.260
 If I think the press conferences were trivial (Cringy) 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
 Somehow, they managed to make it much worse. 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:21.160
 They looked at all the press conferences and said: "You know what? Is not trivial enough 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.160
 We must raise the rate of insignificance much " 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.720
 All right, are you ready? 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.100
 I'm 'Tru Jordi' and welcome to the weight of Kai S and Logan Paul. 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.480
 We will start. 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.040
 For some reason 'Raka Raka' was there, I do not know how this happened or when. 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.860
 Next to the theater, it's Raka Raka 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:52.080
 Why? 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.860
 My God. 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:01.620
 The situation has become somewhat strange. 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.240
 Yes, it's a little strange, we can cut this scene please 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.460
 The security man loved this scene at least. 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:10.040
 I'm glad he has a good time. 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.480
 And now for some reason, it will call you 'Skiers' 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.100
 Why have not I heard this before? 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.040
 Coming to the theater, it's a scooter. 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.600
 Welcome guys, it 's scooters. 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.180
 So, Skiers here, why not talk "???" This will make it truly the best event in Internet history. 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.400
 Just make sure you keep everything here. Things are about to fall off. 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.060
 This is a family program. Okay? 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:42.480
 It is on the balance. 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.080
 Weighs... 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.080
 79 kg 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.320
 Skiers, you know you can forgive. 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.160
 Breathe out, please, you may die, I am worried. 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.480
 Then they stare oddly which have not been done correctly ... 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.720
 Mostly never. 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.680
 Raka wore his clothes. 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.380
 Skiers was like "I do not know, do I wear my clothes or what?" 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.940
 Then he decided to set it aside. 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.880
 Well, that's enough, young boy. 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.260
 This was the strangest stare I've ever seen in my life, I must say this. 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.540
 Does anyone agree with me? 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.160
 Yeah! 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.600
 I do not know whether they will accept each other or join each other. 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.220
 Or maybe both, you're right. 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.800
 Man I can not wait for this fight, it will be very good. 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.060
 You can see that they hate each other. Much drama is a lot of enthusiasm. 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.140
 Get to the point, where Jake came, ten minutes later. 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.940
 And, Jake looks like a dilemma, it looks really big, look at this. 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.100
 I promise you that he will not say to fight anyone. 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.100
 You know it will be a good fight after that. 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.800
 Well, now I'm excited 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.380
 This will be great. Pewdiepie? More like PEDOpie 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:53.380
 No, just joking. 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:57.040
 After Jake Paul took five minutes to take off his chains. 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:59.460
 By five other people. 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.220
 Will finally stand on the balance. 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.900
 At any moment now. 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.760
 "Now he's living / practicing and fighting from Hollywood, I think, who cares about this is not real combat, I'm just here for my salary." 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.680
 Jake then makes a statement about the fighting. It will be a "knockout" from the first round. 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.220
 I will only go for this knockout in the first round. 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.180
 To someone who did it, to someone who did it the next night. 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.240
 It will not be you. 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.040
 It will not be you, is not it, Jake? 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.700
 Well, next, Diggie. 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.080
 My friend, he was training hard, this is the first thing about Digi, it was like ... 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.080
 August 25th. 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.320
 I work hard, does it matter that I lost my coach? 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:51.840
 I work hard, I train hard. 

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.920
 And you know, Diggie seems a bit clumsy. But when he takes off his glasses. 

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:59.180
 We can see, to what extent he was barely trained. finally. 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.920
 It will look severe, I'm sure. 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:05.520
 It is Deggie, the tank. 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.960
 Standing in the balance. 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.860
 Oh no. 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.100
 Oh no. 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.240
 Diggie, oh, no. 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.840
 What were you doing, Digi? 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.760
 He was not exercising, he was drinking wine! 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:27.140
 You know, I thought. Well, at least, even if you lose a fight. 

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:29.220
 At least at its end will be a dilemma anyway. 

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:33.420
 I know it's not about being a dilemma. I know it's about killing. 

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:35.840
 I'm just kidding. It's just a joke. 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:39.680
 Then Digi says his statement. Diggie always has the best statements. 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:41.820
 He always has the smartest things he can say. 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:43.320
 That's why I like Diggy. 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.740
 Do you work hard, Digi? this is the question. 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.120
 What will he answer? 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.760
 It was tempting to face a few now, but he refused. 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:55.760
 Is this - because he is very afraid to come to me. 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.460
 Does this mean any logic? 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.960
 How is this logical .. like ... well. 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.340
 So, we were supposed to face each other. 

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.460
 This does not mean any logic, I mean, we're supposed to fight each other and uniforms like that 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:08.400
 Well, how it is - nothing, that's not logical. 

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:09.400
 where am I? 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.720
 I do not understand this. 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.940
 Yes, it is imaginary. Jake Paul is imaginary. 

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.900
 I will show it. 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:16.560
 On the 25th of ... 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.980
 It's tomorrow! Tomorrow. 

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.220
 * Public laughter * 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:25.020
 V-Decimal ... It's tomorrow! 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.340
 He has just realized that tomorrow. 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:30.460
 My God. 

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.820
 I do not believe this. 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:33.820
 Fighting tomorrow! 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.380
 Great answer to the question, Digi. Thank you very much, as usual. 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:44.140
 The line we all waited for. Logan Paul vs. Kai Si. 

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:48.580
 Logan the Single (Maverick) Paul. 

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:53.780
 Come on, hero. Let's go champ 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:01.260
 Come on, Logan. 

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:04.040
 Come on, Logan. 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.520
 Come on, Logan. 

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:08.660
 The volume becomes slightly louder when Logan climbs up on the stage. 

00:07:19.220 --> 00:07:22.240
 Then KSI comes, finally. 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.420
 Oh no. Oh no. he did not do! 

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.680
 This is the love of Paul Logan. 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:33.680
 My God. 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:36.400
 He is a real fool. 

00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:39.620
 This whole thing is just a jerk. 

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.060
 My God. But the best thing for me in all this weight. 

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:46.380
 It is face-to-face confrontation. 

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.260
 Logan made a great joke. 

00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:53.000
 It's like "Oh smell yourself foul, see what I have, gum" 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:57.480
 Well, oh, it's very foul, here you are, the KSI. 

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:59.480
 And eat it! 

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:09.060
 I hope that piece was poisoned with cyanide. 

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:10.860
 No I do not. I was kidding. 

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:13.020
 Why eat it? 

00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.940
 CAI dies mysteriously before the fighting. 

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:16.940
 Now we know why. 

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:20.220
 Why did he take it? This is very difficult, very strange. 

00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:30.660
 I'm very confused, this thing is strange to me. 

00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:35.320
 Now, for me, rest on fighting a few hours. You'll probably end up watching this video. 

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:38.620
 I wanted to say what I was thinking about before I saw him. 

00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:41.640
 From ... - My expectations are sincere, since I do not know the result. 

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:44.060
 I really really really, I want to win Degi. 

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:46.060
 Just the fact that he ... 

00:08:46.060 --> 00:08:51.340
 For Boxing Fight, the winner will be Comedyshortsgamer, all of them! 

00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:53.340
 Because this is the name of his channel on YouTube 

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.320
 Comicchortzimmer won the win! 

00:08:56.320 --> 00:08:59.660
 I hope Diggie wins only because he has no preference. 

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:03.080
 I think Jake can handle the loss better than DeGee. 

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.660
 Is this logical? 

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:06.660
 In any case! I think Jake will win. 

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.500
 We'll see later if you're right. 

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.500
 But if we come to Logan and CAI. 

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:13.780
 The same thing with KSI, I've always thought he was stupid. 

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:17.360
 But with some of the podcasts he did. 

00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:21.840
 Without all the drama, without all the crazy screams at each other. 

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.720
 I realized that he was not stupid. He is a rational person. 

00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:26.720
 And I respect him. 

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.380
 I hope to win based on the fact that ... 

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:32.480
 He wants to become an angel, right? 

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:35.200
 But if he loses to Logan, he can not really do that. 

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:38.160
 He is the only person who has something to lose here. 

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.220
 Logan has nothing to lose from the basics. 

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.700
 I think that the person who will come stronger during this thing for this reason. 

00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:48.360
 I probably talked about Logan more than any other Utopia. 

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:54.180
 But I am also ordered to do a good job, I hope this is his way to move forward. 

00:09:54.180 --> 00:09:58.220
 I mean, I've already apologized, what could he do more than this? 

00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:00.220
 I do not think anyone is interested so far. 

00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:02.960
 Who will win between KSI and Logan? 

00:10:02.980 --> 00:10:05.620
 It's very good, because I do not know. I do not know. 

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:09.060
 I think Logan Paul will win. I think both brothers are going to win. 

00:10:09.060 --> 00:10:11.060
 Then I think there will be a reaction game. 

00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.060
 But that's just what I think. 

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.680
 Put your bet if you do not know the comments now. 

00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.440
 I'll be back in a few hours, which will take a second. 

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:20.620
 We will see how it happened. 

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:22.580
 Oooooo Yifti. Here we are now. 

00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:24.580
 This direct shot of fighting. 

00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:28.080
 I got special permission to show it, do not worry guys. 

00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:30.560
 This video will not get Strike because of it. 

00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.560
 Now, if you watch the fighting, I'm sorry. 

00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:34.560
 I'm sorry you passed this. 

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:36.220
 This was horrific. Okay? 

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:40.360
 I want to get my money. The whole chat says "money back" 

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:43.220
 everybody. 

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.260
 Initially, KSI against Logan ended in a draw. Of course. 

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:53.320
 The CAI was: "Oh, let's do this again! 

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.540
 It was fun! "No, it was not. 

00:10:56.600 --> 00:10:59.180
 You guys, you've got millions, Mubarak to you. 

00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:01.600
 but not. Just fool me once. Okay. 

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.600
 You fooled me twice. no thanks. 

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:06.700
 Jake won against Dege as I expected. 

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.520
 Unfortunately, this was a good fight, a good job for both of you. 

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.960
 Skiers lost in front of Raka Raka. 

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.580
 And yes, that's all. 

00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.540
 How can I recover my money, this thing works?
