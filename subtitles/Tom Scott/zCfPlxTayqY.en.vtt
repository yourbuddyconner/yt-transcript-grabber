00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.060
 Our society relies on these things 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.859
 This is a sea container. 2.5 by 2.5 by 6.10 meters 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:10.929
 And they are everywhere on every continent. 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.909
 People are containers almost everywhere they are 

00:00:13.909 --> 00:00:17.680
 They are used for storage, for shops, as houses and even as an Antarctic headquarters 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.600
 But more importantly, they are used to transport things. 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:24.680
 Before shipping containers were invented, everything that was transported by ship 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.030
 had different dimensions and had a different packaging 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.180
 And it took a week before a small cargo ship was loaded and unloaded 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.670
 But now almost everything is shipped via containers and the ships are loaded with the aid of huge cranes. 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.469
 Like this, the largest in the world, in London Gateway 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.199
 - Below is the Cap San Marco. It is a 300 meter long vessel. 

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:49.940
 Four gantry cranes are currently working on this. They should be here for roughly 12 hours 

00:00:50.179 --> 00:00:53.069
 -And in those 12 hours you move how many containers? 

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:57.460
 -We move around more than 1100 containers, both for unloading and loading. 

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.749
 - All in 12 hours? 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:00.960
 -All in 12 hours. 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.890
 There is a worldwide network of containers and ports. It is a kind of internet for things. 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.510
 In the same way that standardizing on the internet meant that 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.470
 all computers could talk to each other, standardizing all sea containers 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.610
 meant that all ports, worldwide, could just send things to each other. 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.410
 -You see here a container that has just been brought to our post 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.320
 and it goes through the whole process at full speed. 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.970
 -And that is completely automatic? 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.220
 That is completely automatic 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.180
 - So it is really just a huge robot? 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:35.520
 -Yes it's 200 tons of robots. It takes the containers and puts them in the stock 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.110
 It is a large temporary storage place for containers. A big 3D puzzle 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.850
 From the storage to the vehicle we have equipment called '' shuttle '' 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.980
 It is a powerful, very fast machine that has lifting capabilities. 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.100
 As well as a horziontale transfer 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.060
 It is both a crane and a truck 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:58.350
 And from then on, our 2000 tonne scaffolding taps are picked up as if they were a snowflake. 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.010
 and we load it in the right position, safely on the ship 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.930
 -Set you are in China and you sell 10,000 wrappers to a supermarket in the United Kingdom 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.310
 You do not have to worry about how they get there, 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.030
 you just put them in a container, take them to the port and they disappear into the system. 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.760
 And, if there are no disasters, it is sent to ships for a few days 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.830
 and by transshipment port, essentially routers and it arrives at the port of arrival 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.480
 In the port, the container is loaded onto a truck or train. 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.120
 Because all containers have the same dimensions, each means of transport can transport them. 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.130
 And then it is transported to the distribution center of the supermarket 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:35.410
 Where the containers are emptied and sent to individual stores 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:37.890
 Increasingly, the supermarkets are doing that here, because, yes, 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.450
 why would you have an extra distribution center and an extra trip, if you can just do that here? 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.819
 Here's an important thing: it does not matter what's in the container, 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:53.340
 it's just a big box that literally fits millions of other boxes of all sizes 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.870
 who travel around the world at any time 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.819
 Unless it concerns dangerous goods, even the personnel on the ship do not know what's inside. 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:04.030
 Whiskey is one of the first things that was sent by container 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.500
 There was once a large number or accidentally broken whiskey bottles, I can not imagine why, but suddenly 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.620
 they stopped when the bottles were in a sealed metal box 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.500
 In fact, someone once tried to send themselves over the world with the help of a container 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.530
 and he almost succeeded 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.090
 The vast majority of things that are made in a country and are sold in another country, 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.739
 are sent in containers. 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:33.599
 World trade is just as dependent on this network of physical things as the internet 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.099
 Our society is really maintained by these metal boxes and these gigantic cranes.
