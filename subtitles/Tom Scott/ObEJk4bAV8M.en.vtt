00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.170
 These are the Technical Difficulties, we play Citation Needed. 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:05.070
 Together with me today, he reads books, it is Chris Joel! 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.660
 Hey! 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:07.320
 Everyone's favorite Gary Brannan, Gary Brannan! 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:08.740
 Ultra-pure. 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.900
 Silvered. 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.469
 And available from the Lidl. 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:14.409
 Are you alone? Are you just describing yourself? 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.140
 I just do not want to know which part is redeemed! 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:19.869
 And the most bouncing man on the internet, Matt Gray! 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:21.539
 Put the butt in butter. 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.119
 For me, I have an article from Wikipedia, and these people can not see that. 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.539
 Every fact that they have good is a point and a thing [DING] 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.059
 and there is a special prize for particularly correct answers, and they are ... 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.460
 And today we are talking about the BackpackersXpress. 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.860
 Vwhoomph! 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.400
 Oh, that would have to be done, yes. 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.490
 Is it so called because you can avoid them? 

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.920
 Literally the reverse. 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.370
 It is so named so you can find them! 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.140
 You are obliged to touch them! All the time during the trip. 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:49.540
 "Welcome to the Backpackers Express! 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.230
 "Sit on a backpacker's lap! Let him feel you from behind" 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.840
 You are actually closer that you probably think yourself, 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.510
 so I'm going to give you a point for that. [THING] 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.220
 So is this just a dating site for backpackers? 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.580
 No, certainly not a dating site. 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.100
 Certainly a form of transport. 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.280
 Is it a bus? 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.960
 No. 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.280
 Are they two buses? 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.920
 No. 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.200
 Is it a train? 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.060
 No! 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.480
 Is it a tuk-tuk? 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.900
 You all think too small and too short distances. 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.089
 Is it a huge camel? 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.240
 Is it a night flight from Europe to eastern ... places? 

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:26.920
 Yes, I'll give you a point for that. [DING] It was an idea for setting up 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.329
 that kind of flights for backpackers. 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:30.829
 They are a kind of travel for rich young people who travel on their parents money. 

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.060
 They are indeed traveling for wealthy young people who travel on their parents' money, yes. 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.740
 Would there be or would not be hold baggage? 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.940
 - Well, this ... - All brakes loose! 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.939
 Wrestling in the air! 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.369
 For the sake of clarity, this is not just the name of a flight, 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.060
 this would be an airline. 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.240
 Oh, that would be the most crappy broken plane you've ever seen. 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:53.639
 shake to the edge of the runway, do not you? 

00:01:53.639 --> 00:01:55.099
 All painted on the side. 

00:01:55.099 --> 00:01:57.399
 - Old DC-3 with graffiti on it. - Yeah! 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.779
 They will have thought this up for 2006. 

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:03.920
 That's right, so Gary's gets a point for 'old planes' [DING] 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.079
 they would lease him from another leaser. 

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:07.789
 and you also get a point for 2006 [DING], it was in 2003. 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.390
 Why do you think? 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.560
 Because between 2006-2008 all airlines went bankrupt, 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.189
 because nobody had money. 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:19.250
 Yes, that is largely correct. In fact, you get a point for that. 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.099
 The answer is that in 2005 the company is closed. 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.540
 Is this the kind of society in which your chair assignment would say 'tail gunner', 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.400
 those kind of things? 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.879
 There would be flown with Boeing 747, that they would have. 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.390
 -- Okay okay. - Ooh! 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.890
 What would you like if you were a backpacker in an airplane? 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.629
 Really, really, really very cheap. 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:41.500
 Yes. [THING] 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.439
 Yes. Two ticket types: inside and outside? 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.439
 What is outside then? Tie them to the wing? 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.980
 Really, really intense! 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.960
 Tie them to the wing with duct tape? 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.400
 To be honest, walking on the wing is something, I think it usually usually ... 

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:54.989
 Twelve o'clock wing! 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.109
 It is not a jet engine, at least. 

00:02:57.109 --> 00:03:01.060
 First come, first served. Just a big space, get all the seats out first, 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:04.349
 stack everyone in it, put it on a scale, and it's like that, 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.459
 "All right, we're full now, you're on the next one. 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:09.900
 Large pile of backpackers, even in the cargo area. 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.579
 Yes, I do not think about extras, use your own food, that kind of thing. 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:17.680
 Look, that's not ... I'm going to give Chris a point [DING] 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.400
 it was certainly cheap, throw them all together, 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.560
 a kind of bus, 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.420
 - Like an Air-Bus (!) - If only! 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:25.829
 There were a number of other things they thought about, 

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.829
 and it was not that kind of extras, bring your own food. 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:29.640
 Oh no. Are it annoying things that people ... 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.980
 I'm going to insult people who are backpacking now, hold on tight. 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:36.180
 Are it annoying things that people who enjoy backpacking like, 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.109
 like crafts and stuff like that? 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.260
 Weed chairs! 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.340
 Yes. Possibilities to exchange long stories about how ethical you were then 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.849
 you were there and went on the tourist route? 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:49.529
 You have some very mild stereotypes of backpackers. 

00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:52.849
 -- I am right! - I'm going to give you a point [DING] for stereotypes of backpackers ... 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.739
 No, you have the right side of backpackers. 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.749
 Do not go through customs? ... 

00:03:57.749 --> 00:03:59.950
 Oh-oh! Yes. 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.319
 Ehm, it's certainly something to do with what you can buy tax-free. 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.819
 Smuggle anything you want? 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:09.760
 "We are still three miles outside, bring the weight down, 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:10.829
 "This is your captain ..." 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.810
 - Oh, is it free drink? - Oh, that's a good point! 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.090
 It's not a free drink, but I'll give you a point [DING] 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.690
 there was a small pub on board, the airline was planning to organize an official ... 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:19.820
 Brewery! 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.640
 Brewery! Exactly! [DING] Not even ... I thought you were going to say beer, 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.900
 but brewery was just right, take a point. 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.580
 Well, 747-400s, when they first came, the upper deck had a ... 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:29.770
 - It was a cocktail bar, was not it? - A cocktail bar, yes! 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.180
 It was the kind of place that people like David Frost 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.969
 would laze and flirt in the air. 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:36.380
 Air-skirts hunter! 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.960
 That is a valid comment! What are - you know, you have something like international waters? 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.910
 Once you're out there ... it's a five mile area or something? 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:44.440
 - It's three miles. - Three miles limit. 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.460
 Then you can do whatever you want because you are in international waters, 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.470
 yet, hence pirate transmitters. What are the laws when you are in the air? 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:56.410
 Well, the three-mile coastal waters thing is how far you used to hit someone with an old cannon. 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.460
 - Right. - From the past. 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.210
 So if you extrapolate, you end up with all sorts of disturbing things 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.920
 such as ground-to-air missiles! 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.440
 So I can answer this. It is the 1944 International Civil Aviation Convention: 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.550
 "All aircraft have the nationality of the state in which they are registered." 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:18.539
 - Aha. - So if you are on an American-registered plane, you can not drink under 21 years. 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:21.919
 -- Ah okay! - If you're on an Australian, you can not drink .. 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.440
 I thought that births were recorded in the country the aircraft was flying on? 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:30.639
 If you have a birth in international waters, 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:32.670
 then your birth location is registered as "at sea". 

00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:33.849
 - Yes, that is true. - Nice. 

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.630
 And if you are on a plane, it can be mentioned as "in the air". 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.210
 These are valid data on birth certificates. 

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:42.830
 I've seen baptismal data, around 1780 I think, 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.350
 where the birthplace was given with latitude and longitude 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:49.000
 -- Wow! -- That is cool. 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.720
 - The child was called Atlantica. -- That's nice. That's nice. 

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:56.270
 And we checked the latitude and longitude and it came out in the middle of the Atlantic. 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:01.830
 BackpackersXpress was planning to be an airline with pub on board, 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:05.210
 where backpackers would get cheap tickets and get drunk, 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.139
 and probably everyone who does not want to be associated with backpackers ... 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:10.450
 Would take another flight! 

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.449
 - With another society, yes. - Other flight, yes. 

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:15.530
 The crew would encourage passengers to have a chat with each other. 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.699
 - Oh, go away! - Oh, f *** off! 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:21.719
 Find the British people! 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.520
 - No way, no ... - Then you have to love some forced fun. 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.770
 Oh no, they would probably have those games where you get to know each other while you were on the asphalt, would not they? 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.539
 I was on a bus ... when I was much younger, 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:34.460
 I took that backpackers bus through the Australian Outback, and it is terrible. 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.900
 Oh, go away! Honest! 

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.610
 Did you have very teasing conversations? 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.150
 No! No, I did not have one. 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.110
 - They did not exist yet! -- That could be right. 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.479
 You then had to become the archbishop of Banterbury that you would become later! 

00:06:45.479 --> 00:06:50.110
 God, it's like ... the bus driver played music on things and said: 

00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.340
 "Well, these are the things that you should do! 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:55.409
 These are the actions that you do ******! 

00:06:55.409 --> 00:06:57.460
 These are the actions ... there we go! 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.569
 How long would that flight last? It would take at least eight, nine hours, would not it? 

00:07:00.569 --> 00:07:04.639
 - Eternally! - But it would feel like you were there forever. Just people ... 

00:07:04.639 --> 00:07:06.870
 And it is at least a 24-hour flight from London! 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:11.639
 I will only go with that society if there is a special cabin for people who are ready with mankind. 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:15.370
 That ... that's usually first class on most airlines, Gary. 

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.419
 But on this, unfortunately not. 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:19.460
 No, I would be very happy with access to the pub and the rest, 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.310
 as long as I do not have to talk to other people. 

00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.500
 Again, that is first class. You are literally describing first class. 

00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.190
 The beds in a plane that I am most interested in are those of the crew. 

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:32.330
 It depends on the plane, but most of it is in the nose. 

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:33.449
 right under the cockpit. 

00:07:33.449 --> 00:07:36.930
 Yep. And if you're on an A380, they have two and a half floors on board. 

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:40.180
 There is another half floor in the top of the plane, 

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.860
 with half-high ... you can crawl in there and then sleep. 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.960
 I want that! I would be fine with that. 

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.780
 No, you do not find that, because every time you go after that, 

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:48.480
 and when you get up, then you hit your head. 

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:51.010
 Yes, but I'm not with those f *** ing backpackers, right? 

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:53.060
 That is ... not unreasonable! 

00:07:53.060 --> 00:07:56.800
 So what you are actually saying is that you even go to sleep in the landing gear when needed? 

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.500
 Yes! At least I'm not with them! 

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.040
 That's not ... I think I've explained some news incidents 

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:02.760
 that is not a good place to go to sleep! 

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:06.840
 That's a good place to freeze, die, and fall out in someone's backyard. 

00:08:06.840 --> 00:08:08.620
 I'm not with them, right ?! 

00:08:09.939 --> 00:08:12.719
 Backpackers. Death freeze. Back ... 

00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:17.729
 Everyone around this table goes, "you know what, that is actually a difficult choice". 

00:08:18.289 --> 00:08:20.220
 So what did some experts from the industry do, 

00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.569
 when they looked at these plans, what did they say? 

00:08:22.569 --> 00:08:26.569
 "It's just a look full of motherfuckers at 30,000 feet." 

00:08:26.569 --> 00:08:31.400
 Yes. What was the media term for "look full of assholes at 30,000 feet"? 

00:08:31.400 --> 00:08:33.950
 Sounds like he has completely succeeded, to be honest! 

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:36.700
 If you can define it better, then I would like to hear it! 

00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:38.060
 If you get angry in a car, what do you call it? 

00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:38.800
 Traffic aggression! 

00:08:38.810 --> 00:08:40.269
 What do you call that in an airplane? 

00:08:40.269 --> 00:08:42.029
 - Air aggression! - Air aggression. Take a point [DING] 

00:08:42.029 --> 00:08:43.801
 -- Creative! -- Yes. 

00:08:43.801 --> 00:08:48.620
 "Annoying or violent behavior committed boarding an airplane." 

00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:51.420
 I even have the first case of air aggression here, 

00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:53.920
 and I'll give you a point if you can estimate about the year. 

00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.089
 Is it ridiculous early? Is it 1915 when two pilots had a discussion in the air? 

00:08:58.089 --> 00:09:01.949
 I wanted to say, I think of a man called the Red Baron, 

00:09:01.949 --> 00:09:04.220
 he has quite annoyed some people. 

00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:06.100
 Not between planes, I mean between gunner and pilot ... 

00:09:06.100 --> 00:09:09.100
 No, it must be on a passenger plane. 

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:11.060
 - The sixties. - Around 1920. 

00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:15.060
 Yes. That will be the closest, things like the small two-engine De Havilland, 

00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:16.990
 if there are only 16 people who are upset. 

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:18.550
 Flying between London and Paris, that kind of thing. 

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:22.430
 Always searching for ... not margarita, what is the word I'm looking for? Martini. 

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:24.149
 -- Yes. - So what do you think? 

00:09:24.149 --> 00:09:25.310
 Ah, 30s. De Havilland. 

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:28.290
 1938, Neville Chamberlain's flight back from Germany. 

00:09:28.290 --> 00:09:30.769
 You said 30s first, so you get a point, but it was actually the 40's. 

00:09:30.769 --> 00:09:34.850
 1947, on a flight from Havana to Miami. [THING] 

00:09:34.850 --> 00:09:38.870
 It was just a drunken man who hit a passenger and bit the stewardess. 

00:09:38.870 --> 00:09:40.320
 Bite flight attendants! 

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.100
 Ahh! I'm sure the person appreciated it. 

00:09:44.100 --> 00:09:46.140
 if you were behind him with your martini ... 

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:50.240
 - "I think you have this ...!" - "Bite stewardess!" 

00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.740
 "This does not help!" 

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:55.560
 This has led to the second incident of air aggression. 

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.780
 That is a stewardess who beat someone! 

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:04.800
 That whole plane landed with only injured people! 

00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:07.440
 Well, it goes back to what we mentioned earlier, 

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:09.790
 because they did not know in which jurisdiction it was, 

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.560
 nobody in the landing zone really wanted to prosecute them. 

00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:14.080
 and they often came away with it. 

00:10:14.089 --> 00:10:17.050
 And in the end it became the laws of the country 

00:10:17.050 --> 00:10:20.170
 where the aircraft is registered has priority. 

00:10:20.170 --> 00:10:23.589
 Has it already happened with planes, just like boats, 

00:10:23.589 --> 00:10:25.000
 that they are registered in tax havens? 

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000
 That is a valid comment, I just asked myself. 

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.079
 It is difficult for most companies to do that, 

00:10:30.079 --> 00:10:31.190
 because they want to be the flag bearer, 

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:32.320
 and then they want to be registered ... 

00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:35.279
 British Airways wants to be registered in the United Kingdom. 

00:10:35.279 --> 00:10:37.320
 There are still a lot of national airlines there. 

00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.660
 So if I want a flight-fighting club with no consequences ...? 

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:44.800
 - Aeroflot. - That's what I want to say, what is the best country to register my plane? 

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.839
 Air Astana! 

00:10:45.839 --> 00:10:48.339
 Yes! Like the Cayman Islands or something? 

00:10:48.339 --> 00:10:52.980
 That is if you do not want tax, but because if you do not want to be punished because you hit someone? 

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.500
 I think there are very few countries that 

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:58.700
 and have no law against and where you can register a plane. 

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:01.980
 I'm going to say this; somewhere out there is a rich guest 

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.430
 who is now investigating this. 

00:11:04.430 --> 00:11:08.360
 That's true. "What can we do in international waters? Oh, I do not know!" 

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.810
 Oh, I could really break an order now to say nothing. 

00:11:10.810 --> 00:11:13.700
 but I will not do that. I really could. 

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.140
 You could do it, but then I have to cut it out. 

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:15.760
 Well, ... [Deleted for legal reasons] 

00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:20.920
 So, the BackpacersXpress never came to that point. 

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:24.079
 - Good. - They could not lease an airplane. 

00:11:24.079 --> 00:11:27.110
 Wow, that's the first stumbling block, is not it? 

00:11:27.110 --> 00:11:30.929
 They have never been able to get enough funding. What did the industry think of them? 

00:11:30.929 --> 00:11:33.579
 - They were just big bastards! -- Not much! 

00:11:33.579 --> 00:11:37.970
 The Times expressed it as "it is for any spiritually healthy bystander 

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.350
 the question is whether the project ever gets off the ground. " 

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.560
 I did not even realize that when I read it, that it literally and figuratively ... 

00:11:44.570 --> 00:11:46.810
 And that was a joke from the Times of London! 

00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:52.060
 And that the 'party in the air', and I quote this, was a "radical change". 

00:11:52.060 --> 00:11:55.200
 - Not in the '90s' radical', but in ... - No! 

00:11:55.209 --> 00:11:57.050
 And I think when the Times goes ... 

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:59.750
 - It's the same as if you say "Well, that's courageous". - Yes. 

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:02.370
 I just realize: is this the Venga Plane? 

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:05.600
 This is actually Venga Airways, is not it ?! 

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.500
 That's impossible?! 

00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.320
 - Sorry! - Oh, we want to party! 

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.180
 You just remember those numbers, do not you? It's in your head now. 

00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.180
 No, luckily I do not know the text! 

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.300
 Do they do a New York to San Francisco route? 

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:22.100
 -- Here we go! That was the Vengabus. That was the bus. 

00:12:22.100 --> 00:12:25.699
 That was the bus. No, the plane went to Ibiza. The plane always ... 

00:12:25.699 --> 00:12:28.440
 - Oh, god, now I remember it again! - Yes, you are completely right! 

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:30.180
 It was indeed Ibiza. 

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:33.000
 Regardless of the mode of transport, it is always an Intercity Disco. 

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.510
 No, wait, that was the train. 

00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.130
 No, that was the bus! That was definitely the bus! 

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:39.300
 - Yes, but Intercity is a type of train. -- All right. 

00:12:39.300 --> 00:12:42.480
 You are no longer welcome in my house. Go away! 

00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:44.540
 Some trains used to have a disco carriage. 

00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:47.080
 - That's no joke. - In the 70's? 

00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.760
 -- Yes! In the 70's. -- What?! 

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:51.700
 In the 70s, some special trains, especially special football trains, 

00:12:51.709 --> 00:12:54.310
 British Rail then ... 

00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:57.329
 This is the train for all football supporters, 

00:12:57.329 --> 00:12:59.250
 so that the commuters were not bothered by the football supporters. 

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:03.170
 Wait a second! This is the BackpackersXpress but one for footballers on trains? 

00:13:03.170 --> 00:13:05.040
 It is for, in principle, if you go somewhere for a race, 

00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:09.139
 then you rent a complete special football train, with only old carriages, 

00:13:09.139 --> 00:13:12.250
 so that everyone is gathered in a place, and that the police know when you arrive, 

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:16.440
 but on the back of that wagon she put an empty goods wagon, 

00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:18.660
 with a disco in it! And you would have the disco car. 

00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:20.860
 They were used as pub wagon on the Southern ... 

00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:25.570
 - Twisted! - They put a wagon on the rails and set it up as a pub. 

00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:28.560
 - Fantastic. - But the problem was that there were no windows in it. 

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:31.579
 - Because there were bar chairs in it. - It is a sea container! 

00:13:31.579 --> 00:13:34.260
 She put chairs in it, so you had no idea where you were. 

00:13:34.260 --> 00:13:36.060
 when the pub ... when the train stopped! 

00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:38.230
 Also, do you really want so many drunken people 

00:13:38.230 --> 00:13:40.600
 who can not look outside on a swinging train? 

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:43.600
 It was for commuters! It was for people who went home on a Friday night, 

00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:44.930
 then she put the bar car into it. 

00:13:44.930 --> 00:13:46.000
 Oh, that's brilliant! 

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.579
 There is no better way to guarantee that you end up at the end station by accident. 

00:13:50.579 --> 00:13:55.139
 I know that! But it was a good country pub, dimmed beer glasses, with a taped drink. 

00:13:55.139 --> 00:13:57.539
 - Fantastic! -- Good idea. 

00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:01.160
 That is not a bad plan. I mean, it's a bad plan now, 

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.160
 because you can not lose so many people in it, and ... 

00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.440
 I do not know, if you make it civilized, 

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.350
 you go to a dimpled pint, sort of a beer pub 

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:11.590
 It is monitoring itself! 

00:14:11.590 --> 00:14:13.740
 - buyer table tops, yeah! -- Fireplace! 

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:17.340
 -- Fireplace?! -- Yes! I think it had a fireplace! 

00:14:17.340 --> 00:14:19.120
 I do not make a joke. It is a steam train. 

00:14:19.120 --> 00:14:20.880
 I wanted to say, let's face it, if it's propelled by steam, 

00:14:20.880 --> 00:14:22.870
 then it is not unlikely that you can do that there. 

00:14:22.870 --> 00:14:24.790
 Yes! There is already a big fire at the front, 

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:26.630
 also make a small one in the middle, that's fine! 

00:14:26.630 --> 00:14:29.300
 Hey, also a great way to get it burning! 

00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:32.139
 Remove the coals directly from the firebox! 

00:14:32.139 --> 00:14:35.410
 It is true, that is how people used to travel, children. 

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.329
 Is it the end of the sliding scale? 

00:14:37.329 --> 00:14:40.279
 So then you have the dining room wagon, then there is something like a snack wagon, 

00:14:40.279 --> 00:14:43.610
 then they will have a soft drink wagon, then you have the pub wagon. 

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:47.060
 and then you have the club at the end of the night-wagon. 

00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:51.019
 Imagine that! Can you roll from the end of the club wagon 

00:14:51.019 --> 00:14:53.099
 in the kebab-van-wagon at the very end. 

00:14:53.100 --> 00:14:55.959
 That is just a trailer that gets carried away. 

00:14:57.280 --> 00:14:58.800
 "Salad and sauce?!" 

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:02.360
 But it is a steam powered running thing for the ... 

00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:07.040
 "Make some coal in it!" "Fine!" 

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:09.820
 But it is true, they did not roast the meat with the coals, 

00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:14.509
 they only provide the power for the electric grill that turns the meat around. 

00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:17.509
 That is a great idea. Oh, come on British Rail, make sure it happens. 

00:15:17.509 --> 00:15:19.680
 British Rail! British Rail has not existed for a long time! 

00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.300
 Congratulations Chris, you win this! 

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:23.660
 Fantastic! 

00:15:23.670 --> 00:15:25.660
 Congratulations, today's price is French. 

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:26.959
 - Oh aye? - Oui oui! 

00:15:26.959 --> 00:15:30.219
 You win chocolate icing in the form of a cow. 

00:15:31.579 --> 00:15:33.250
 It is la vache ganache. 

00:15:33.250 --> 00:15:36.990
 You were done with Matt right in time, well done! 

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.020
 With that we say thanks to Chris Joel, 

00:15:39.020 --> 00:15:40.260
 Gary Brannan, 

00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:41.359
 - Matt Gray. - Goodbye, YouTube. 

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.820
 I was Tom Scott, until the next time!
