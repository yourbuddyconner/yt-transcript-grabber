00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.520
 I am in a glider somewhere above Oxfordshire with Bruce, my pilot and instructor 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:07.700
 behind me. Thank you very much, Bruce. 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.000
 And I have a bottle of water with me. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.400
 We now fly horizontally and as you would expect the water in the bottle is approximately horizontal. 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.119
 But take a good look at what happens when we start running. 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:20.819
 Bruce, a spin - there we go. A left turn. 

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:22.819
 O wow, what a view! Now take a good look at this. 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:28.749
 Look at the horizon. According to the camera, it is no longer horizontal. 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:33.860
 But look at the bottle: the water here is flat. If you can not see the horizon, 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.410
 then you do not feel that you are in a corner. 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.100
 And watch how fast we go! 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.370
 That's very strange, right? But if you've ever been in a jetliner, one 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.380
 commercial plane, you know that it can make such a turn without it 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.860
 to throw your food and drinks. 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.690
 Thank you, Bruce, back in a horizontal position. 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.260
 Now, what would happen if we could not see the horizon? 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.840
 Because there is a lot of strange delusion going on here. 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.930
 If you do not see the horizon anymore, hit after about 15 to 20 seconds ... 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.479
 your equilibrium organs used to it. The only difference that you notice is 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.549
 a little g-force, but that is hardly noticeable. 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:16.560
 If your only reference is your own sense of being: the forces count together ... 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.920
 so downstairs is always where your feet are. Even while turning. 

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:24.499
 A bottle of water will not help you either. 

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:29.039
 Now again while turning to the right, still right here. 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.389
 If we flew higher now, just below those pretty scary clouds above us ... 

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:33.950
 and we could not see; 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.780
 then we would not know if we were running. And that is terrifying. 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.459
 Because when you turn, you lose a little height. And if you drop you say 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:45.889
 altimeter that you go down; and you think you're flying horizontally? 

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:51.450
 To keep your height then you will try to withdraw. But in a bend 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.639
 makes the problem worse. It makes the turn narrower and narrower and ultimately .... 

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:59.810
 you come in what, for obvious reasons, is called a graveyard spiral. (Deadly spiral) 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.420
 That is why we do not fly in clouds or at night. 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.640
 BRUCE: I'm going to accelerate to 100 knots, draw horizontally and then slowly move on ... 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.729
 TOM: Oh dear. Yes Yes Yes. 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.460
 BRUCE: There it goes. 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.260
 TOM: O wow. O wow. Stay calm. 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.740
 Stay calm. Stay calm. Stay calm. 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.860
 [GEROEP] 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.250
 BRUCE: Look up. 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:29.350
 TOM: O mine. O wow. [INCOMPATIBLE] 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.980
 BRUCE: Yee-ha! 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.230
 TOM: Bruce. Thank you very much. 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:36.380
 BRUCE: That was great. 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:40.780
 TOM: Bruce is a member of the Edinburgh University Gliding Club and I also need the Loughborough 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.720
 Thanking University Gliding Club and Alistair who brought me here. 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.960
 Now back safely to the ground. Thanks again very much. 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:55.500
 That was amazing. 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.440
