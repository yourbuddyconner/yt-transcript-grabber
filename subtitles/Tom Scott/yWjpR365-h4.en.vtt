00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.680
 I am here in Manhattan, 50th street, and behind me under that platform 

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:07.640
 is Tad's roast steaks, one of the first fast food restaurants. 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.760
 I mean, it's not what we would recognize today. It is more of a cafeteria. 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.320
 But the idea that you go in and order from a very limited menu with few options, 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.200
 and it's cheap: that was the idea of â€‹â€‹the Townsend family and Tad's roast steaks. 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:21.840
 But that is not what I am here for. 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.940
 What I'm going to tell here is about a less successful idea from the 1960s' 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:31.180
 Here, in the first building of East 42nd Street, about where McDonald's is now, 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.500
 she opened Tad's varieties. 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.520
 Little has been known about this. The only article from that time I could find was in the New Yorker 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.740
 from 1963, which explained the concept. 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.700
 You go inside, and choose a frozen meal prepared earlier that day or week, 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:51.020
 you take it to a microwave on your table and heat it up yourself. 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.740
 And that is such a great idea - that has to change the world. 

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.740
 The person who had opened the restaurant even that in the future, there would be only two types of restaurants. 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.500
 chic, luxurious restaurants where others cook for you, and cafeterias like this one, 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.140
 where you go inside, choose a frozen meal and heat it up in your own microwave. 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.080
 And he was almost correct. 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.440
 But not completely. He has not been able to predict the house microwave, the ready meals and the TV dinners 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.380
 This actually changed the world. 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.620
 The restaurant closed soon afterwards, but Ray Kroc, the man who started McDonald's, 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.760
 he took the advice from the Townsend family. 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.940
 McDonald's there, is in sizes, a descendant of a restaurant that most likely not 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.940
 worked on its own, but it did have a "small" mark on history. 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.520
 Who knows, if history had worked out differently, perhaps there would be microwave cafeteria 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.520
 around the world. 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.100
