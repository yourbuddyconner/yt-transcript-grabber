00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.170
 Brace yourself, we are about to talk in detail about telephone systems. 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.930
 I am at the Museum of Communications in Seattle to answer a question: 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:12.519
 In old Hollywood movies, when someone phones and hangs up, 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.320
 Why does a dial tone sound? 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.360
 [dial tone] 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.240
 "You can put your beautiful plan into your beautiful ass" [dial tone] 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.700
 'Supervision' is the word that describes how a telephone switch 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.880
 knows whether the calling and answering parties have hung up. 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.960
 When you end a call and hang up, 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.480
 the switch receives this on-hook signal, 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.440
 and the connection that was in use at that time 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.180
 breaks and goes back to its standard state. 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.870
 So you end up with silence. 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.870
 The reason that a sound engineer would use a dial tone 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.040
 instead of nothing is logical, right? 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.750
 It is to make clear that the other side has hung up. 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.910
 That is certainly what many people claim online. 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.559
 Except that they could do that with the help of one short sound effect. 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.200
 And sometimes, that happens. 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.090
 "Never call me again." 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.100
 [rattling click] 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.100
 "Wow! 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 I... 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.100
 I am guessing that you are at home. " 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.100
 "Good luck." 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.400
 [rattling click] 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.510
 It appears that there is another reason. 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.750
 In the days of celluloid film 

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.310
 Southern California was one of the few places in America 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.030
 with independent telephone companies, 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.380
 they were not part of the big Bell monopoly that held the rest of the country. 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.600
 Behind us is a step-by-step system 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.800
 and it is a family member of the telephony systems 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.030
 which was most commonly used in Southern California. 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.180
 The Bell system did not really have a monopoly there. 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.500
 If I choose a number, the various components connect, step by step, 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.180
 me through the system from start to finish. 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.360
 And that's where it got the name step-by-step. 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.979
 When I have finished choosing, connect the conversation ... 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.140
 [ringtone] 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.680
 ... and it can be answered. 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.200
 The step system has no insight into the called party. 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.829
 And that means that the called party can hang up and pick up 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.109
 as often as they want, and the connection is not broken. 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.840
 But if the caller hangs up ... 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.940
 [dial tone] 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.640
 ... the called party immediately receives a dial tone, 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.930
 because the system does not know if I was hanged 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.280
 or that I just picked up the phone. 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.000
 So in Hollywood, where all films were written and filmed, 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.840
 their experience on the phone was different 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.500
 with those of the rest of America and the world. 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.780
 What, let's face it, is a bit like many other things in Hollywood. 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.080
 The conclusion is: 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.460
 the people who make the films really got a dial tone when they were hung up, 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.209
 at least sometimes, so they also do that in their films. 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.770
 Or they chose the option that worked best for the scene. 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:54.280
 Whether it still happens when someone uses a mobile phone? 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.280
 That's just lazy. 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.290
