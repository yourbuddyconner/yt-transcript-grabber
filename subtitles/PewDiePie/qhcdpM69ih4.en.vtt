00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:02.820
 "Hi" 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.500
 Excuse me I was busy 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.060
 Respecting women 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.660
 My name is the polite boy Pewdiepie 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.260
 and I've gathered millions of followers like you 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.100
 who are good boys 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.460
 we spend most of the time respecting the girls 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.940
 and putting them to the fore, thinking of how we can be the best 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.600
 how can we be less cruel dreary, night creatures 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.700
 Join me because now we will see some of the best guys on the Internet 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.780
 Like me and like you 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.180
 or if you are not yet, you can become a good guy 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.280
 Let's watch the subreddit of good guys and celebrate 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.440
 for some of the best people on the planet 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.140
 Good guys 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.260
 operator: what did you call us? - Please help me, someone has entered my home 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.300
 Not all men are like that, I would not do that 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:02.460
 As a good boy I'm never going to enter into any house of any woman 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.540
 If it were a man inside, maybe I would think it 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.780
 but I would make sure the woman felt safe 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.480
 because I'm a good guy named Pewdiepie 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:12.400
 if you are a good boy, you will understand me 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:18.420
 I hate "friendzone", make a woman a chocolate coffee and she will not have sex with you 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.620
 Unbelievable 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.620
 What are you gaining? 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:29.160
 I did this great coffee, to give you everything I had 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.500
 I made you brown with chocolate, why do not you love me !! 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.740
 I'm a good guy 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.600
 Why Lisa? Why? Please talk to me, please! 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.520
 Why do all women choose their boys? 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.500
 If they knew what the good boy I am, the women will be tongued from all sides 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.860
 You are afraid 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.460
 Graffiti drawing I've seen in Melbourne today 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.880
 How do good boys think that sex works? 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.640
 All that time I've respected women, sex with the bollek 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.600
 So at least give them the proper merit for the men 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.160
 We all look like kittens here ha ha ha 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.100
 A kite of my friends 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.960
 No, all, 1 minute silence for this guy 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:30.460
 That hurts, they all saw how this fucking sorry me 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.940
 I want to be a citizen of Finland (finnish). 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.500
 Ah well 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.540
 uh .. yes 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.400
 Back in the row! 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:42.840
 Why? 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.560
 Good guys end up (finnish) at the end. 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.200
 thumbs up 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.480
 Hey, hey, look at this joke: are you finished, - yes i'm Swedish 

00:03:00.885 --> 00:03:12.465
 Yes, be virgin and proud! Because unlike you sexually abusive people, I respect women! 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:25.600
 I did not enter my genitals somewhere near you 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.500
 It is unfortunate with the buzzing ones after much potential 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.500
 How many would like women not to look at my appearance but to like for what I am 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.360
 I love you Robert. -Yes, but you're a shem. 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.240
 It is always the case that good guys go after women who are far better than them 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.620
 I think this is the problem, I mean NO 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.900
 They are good boys because they have good intentions in their hearts 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.360
 Okay, they are not sexually disabled 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.760
 Mario, you saved me, here's a kiss for thanksgiving 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.280
 In and over the top of the world filled with the perbindesha princess name 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.880
 Stripped breasts 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:08.880
 I actually said this when I played the last Super Marion 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.760
 because you do a lot to save him 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.000
 I said it good enough to be ready to have sex 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.580
 I should not put this part in the video 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.160
 What the hell .... What do these mean? 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.420
 God is. "I'm not the average guy, because I can give you an orgasm that you will never forget" 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.220
 suspect 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.820
 I do not lie to women ... Lol 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.060
 "So you only give birth to males?" 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.660
 I do not believe in the old concept of meetings, relationships, and marriages 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.940
 After I clicked your profile I changed my mind 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.900
 It's okay, what a coincidence! He changed his mind as soon as he was rejected. Very good! 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.480
 It worked well for both parties 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:55.060
 Hi. I'm Stan, I'm fine to meet you 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.320
 You look very lovely, and I like your very own pretty face. " 

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.320
 20 minutes later .. 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.060
 Going forward. I can beat you 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.380
 You let me wait 20 minutes? Arrgggg 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.120
 I can be a good guy ... 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.580
 I can be a good guy named Stan, but if I can wait 20 minutes, 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.240
 Then my anger will be released on you, the word with you 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:35.740
 "It's stupid when women say they can not find a man when they ignore me." 

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:41.140
 "It's like saying you're hungry when the hot dog is on the ground." 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.040
 This was a good post. 

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:51.320
 Why drink alcohol or drugs? When I grow taller in respect of women. ] 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.840
 I also like all the good boys we can feel 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:59.660
 It's one of the fun things you can do. Very rewarding. 

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:03.760
 I love, but I'm not interested, mfal 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.300
 You're like all the girls ... 

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.880
 filth 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.460
 You do not need to be irrelevant 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.860
 "Why are you, you're rude, not a" 

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:14.060
 "How do I get rude?" 

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.880
 All girls are the same 

00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:16.840
 "Why?" 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.160
 "You all the rage, betray me, do not give me ..." 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.420
 Okay what the hell 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.820
 A good boy, a hitch 

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.820
 I feel this man. You have to give the boy a chance! Good boy deserves a hunch! 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.500
 I love you very much 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:36.200
 "I hope he will betray you, you deserve it, sniffle" 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.240
 I hope you die 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:44.100
 All right now. Tung. I hope you die. 

00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:48.860
 "I think men should post" I do not "to show that most of us are good boys 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:51.600
 who would never attack or abuse women. " 

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:55.580
 On the contrary, we love and honor them! 

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:59.860
 Yes. Hashtag #UneJo 

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:08.540
 Someone has thought of this. Oh god. Hashtag #UneJo. Not me. I'm a good guy. 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.200
 "Hey Anna" 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:12.240
 "Did we have an English assignment?" 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.220
 "No." 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:14.780
 "Thank you very much!" 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:16.100
 "No problem" 

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.260
 "What do we have?" 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.620
 "Filling college applications" 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:21.820
 "Very well, I see the Flash." 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:22.720
 "Are you there?" 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:24.600
 "I was focused on my job" 

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:26.120
 "Can we talk about something?" 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:27.440
 "Ok of course" 

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.600
 "Do you want to talk?" 

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.540
 "I can speak" 

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.100
 "Let's talk about movies. What is your favorite? 

00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:34.100
 "Do you like scary movies?" 

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.600
 "What's your favorite scary movie?" 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:40.000
 "I think uhhh .. I like Guardians of the galaxy" 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:44.860
 "If I was not so aware I would think that you are trying to impress me" 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:45.620
 "What?" 

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.520
 "Everyone knows I like super heroes" 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:50.560
 Many people like them ... 

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:56.200
 "It's great that I've got this together. We're very similar if you think so well." 

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:58.880
 "Are you angry with me?" 

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:01.540
 "No, why am I angry with you?" 

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.100
 Oh. Well you did not answer so I supposed, I'm sorry 

00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:08.680
 "I'm so busy now" 

00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.280
 "Well, when you're not busy ... 

00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:17.100
 "Can you go out to a meeting with me? It will put you in a good night and see a movie." 

00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.740
 "I'm not sure if the boyfriend would like this" 

00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.020
 "You do not have to be so unkind." 

00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:26.620
 "What do you want?" 

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.160
 "See how you look from within." 

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:38.340
 "You wrote me briefly throughout this conversation !!" 

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:49.420
 "I can not do it. It 's hard to be a good guy 

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.760
 "I've respected women 3 times a day. Let me put them in." 

00:08:56.060 --> 00:08:56.920
 "It does not work that way." 

00:08:56.920 --> 00:08:57.740
 It works! 

00:08:58.820 --> 00:09:00.020
 It works! 

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.200
 "Irma is a beautiful name. Maybe if I stay ..." 

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.020
 "She'll see my commitment to her and come out to meet me." 

00:09:08.020 --> 00:09:09.020
 "Hurricane" 

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.460
 "My love, how much mascara" 

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:16.520
 "My lady certainly deserves better! I will always be very respectful!" 

00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.620
 "Wow, you're the kindest man I've ever met." 

00:09:19.900 --> 00:09:21.640
 "In fact, too polite!" 

00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.040
 "Jooooo" 

00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:28.740
 I devil and my good behavior 

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.280
 Aghhh! Curse me! 

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.580
 I just can not afford to fancy 

00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:35.900
 Because I'm very polite 

00:09:35.900 --> 00:09:38.160
 "What have you excited about?" 

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:40.240
 "From being shameful and uncomfortable close to the males. 

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:42.600
 Atatatatatata 

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:45.140
 How can I do this about me? 

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.500
 Let's see! 

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:51.140
 I agree. in males we are complete masks, but 

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:52.900
 But! 

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.880
 I want to put this on - I'm not masquerading 

00:09:56.380 --> 00:10:01.260
 "There are some men who are loving and kind as UNE 

00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:05.040
 "somewhere out there" 

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:09.420
 If you are a good person, you do not have to struggle so much to obey others 

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:14.000
 you are a kind person, you just have to be a kind person 

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.480
 Had UNEEEE! 

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.400
 Give it a "like" if you're a nice guy. No matter who you are, if you're a nice guy 

00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:29.560
 This was your presenter, my dear boy Pewdiepie. Now, excuse me until I continue to respect women. 

00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:32.360
 Every day, brother. 

00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:33.560
 Outside Family Team 

00:10:33.660 --> 00:10:35.920
 Do you like frightening movies? 

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:38.260
 What is your favorite movie scary?
