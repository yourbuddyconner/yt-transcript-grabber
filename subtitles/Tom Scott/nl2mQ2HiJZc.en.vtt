00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.510
This remote beach in the
far south-west of England

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.950
was a major target during
the Second World War.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:07.530
It was so tactically important

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.360
that the government's
Petroleum Warfare Department

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.370
installed flame throwers
all the way across it

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:15.090
to try and repel anyone who might try

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.180
to come ashore and
sabotage what's underneath.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.770
Welcome to Porthcurno in Cornwall.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:22.960
Under here was how Britain
talked to the world,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:25.800
and to a lesser extent, how it still does.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.690
- Under the Porthcurno Beach ran
the original telegraph cables

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.670
linking Britain with her Empire.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.150
What you're looking at is the cable hut

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.290
which was the original
landing point for the cables

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.700
which ran from Porthcurno
all around the world.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.360
There were 14 cables. The length of the cables
amassed about 186,000 miles.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.910
The cables were dragged up the beach,

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.490
terminated into old valve terminations
in the cable hut

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.390
and then the message
was relayed underground

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.920
up to the cable station, which is the
building that now houses the museum.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.330
These cables were fearsomely
expensive to make and to lay

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.260
and the last thing you needed
is some idiot dropping an anchor on them

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.900
or snagging them in their nets.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.920
The beach has got very deep sand
and it shifts all the time,

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.308
so it's never been used for fishing,

00:01:10.308 --> 00:01:12.470
so you don't have boats
landing here regularly,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.100
or you didn't in 1870,
so it was a perfect place.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.680
We also have World War II tunnels.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.870
Back in 1939, when war was declared,

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.610
we had Britain's premier
communications hub

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.390
in a very prominent white building,

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:26.320
standing out on top of a cliff
in a sparsely populated area,

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:27.880
which wasn't the smartest idea.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.623
So, 15,000 tonnes of granite
was blasted out from the cliff

00:01:31.623 --> 00:01:33.890
and the whole thing was moved underground.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.580
- A lot of folks think
that when they're sending

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.430
a message to someone in another country,

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.440
it's getting bounced up to
a satellite and back down.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.420
But, unless you're in a really rural area,

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.010
that is not the case.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:46.770
Most comm satellites
in geostationary orbit,

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.500
which means that they are falling
around the earth

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.290
at the exact same rate
that the earth is spinning below them.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.410
But to make that orbit work,

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.760
they have to be so far away
that it takes half a second

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.200
for a signal to get beamed
up to them and back down.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.915
The route around the surface of the earth
is much shorter and much faster

00:02:02.915 --> 00:02:05.785
and it doesn't involve
blasting something into orbit.

00:02:05.785 --> 00:02:08.760
Undersea cables do have
their own troubles, though.

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:14.440
- November 2016, Jersey pretty much
lost all its internet communication

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.220
because a boat dragged
its anchor across the seabed,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.830
took out three high capacity
cables, leaving just one,

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.980
and Jersey was... not cut off,

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.824
but hugely reduced communications whilst
they set about repairing them.

00:02:26.824 --> 00:02:29.780
When they laid the first cable out to
the Isles of Scilly from Porthcurno,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.270
it was all well reported in the media

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.490
about how they were
going to get connectivity.

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.103
What wasn't reported was that
they'd actually made the cable too short.

00:02:37.103 --> 00:02:40.169
So what they did was
they got an end of cable,

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:44.265
connected this dead end-of-cable
up to the landing station

00:02:44.265 --> 00:02:46.285
and went, "Hoorah, it works!"

00:02:46.285 --> 00:02:48.270
when it wasn't working at all

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.040
and then the media took all the photos,
they went away,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.510
and then they put the problem right.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.740
So, don't always believe what
you see on film.

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:56.920
Or YouTube!

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.780
- There are still active telecom cables
under Porthcurno beach,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.400
although they're fibre-optic these days,
and they don't surface

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.650
at the Telegraph Museum's
old cable hut here.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.370
They surface at industrial-looking buildings
somewhere further ashore.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.620
One of those cables, called FLAG,
goes all the way

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.050
from under this beach here to Japan,

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.130
15,000 miles of cable stopping at a dozen
other countries along the way

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.100
and it can carry up to 100 gigabytes
of data every second.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.400
And it's just one of many that land
somewhere in this part of Britain.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.050
The fact that there's also
several buildings owned

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.200
by the British Intelligence Services
around here is not a coincidence.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.740
So the next time you're in a group chat
with people all over the world

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.790
or video calling someone
on another continent,

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.630
just take a moment and remember that

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:40.810
somewhere near you there is a beach

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.623
with your conversation literally
flashing underneath it.
