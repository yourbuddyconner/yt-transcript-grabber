00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.200
 I stand on Mount Evans in Colorado, USA 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.940
 It is one of the Colorado Fourteeners 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.550
 This means that I stand at more than 14,000 feet above sea level. 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:10.620
 Like the Americans measure it. 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:11.740
 For the rest of the world: 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.900
 that is 4.3 kilometers above sea level 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.960
 or about halfway the flying altitude of a passenger plane. 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.560
 The air here is thin. 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.940
 Every time I inhale, I get about 60% of my normal oxygen. 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.720
 And I can tell you, it was a difficult climb 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.880
 At least, the last piece ... 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.580
 This is also the most American mountain ever. 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.920
 There is a road all the way to the top. 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.280
 The highest asphalt road of North America. 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.140
 The peak counts as the 41st highest mountain in North America. 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.300
 But how do we measure that? 

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.390
 A little further away is the beautifully named Meyer-Womble Observatory. 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.300
 This is on a peak that is slightly lower. 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.830
 And he is surrounded by lower ground. 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.200
 Why is that not the 42nd highest mountain in North America? 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.780
 You could say: 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.280
 That seems clear to me. The peak is part of the same mountain? 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.070
 But when does that stop? 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.460
 The peak, Mount Evans, is a small part of a large mountain range. 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.290
 You could argue that this is just a valley 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.460
 on the way to the highest peak in the Rockies, Mount Elbert. 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:06.740
 Or you can make it even more extreme and say it 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.810
 that there is only one mountain on every land mass. 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.960
 And that every peak is actually a small bump 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.200
 on the way to a mountain as big as a continent, with the name Denali. 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.060
 Most people would say that that is idiotic. 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.060
 It is clear, is not it? 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.060
 That is a mountain. 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.060
 And that is not a mountain. 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.120
 Formally we solve this by measuring protrusions. 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.180
 Projections work as follows: 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.650
 Imagine that you can pull up the sea to where I am now. 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.240
 How many meters does he have to lower again before 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.780
 this mountain is connected to another, larger mountain? 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.220
 And all that without getting wet feet? 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.580
 For Mount Evans that is 839m down. 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.210
 About 1/5 of its height above sea level. 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.100
 The peak of the observatory? 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.100
 It is not prominent. 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.540
 Of course you have to walk down from there, but after a few meters 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.280
 you go up the mountain again. 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.940
 Where do we draw the line? 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.430
 Well, there are different lines to draw, because of course there are. 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.060
 The International Climb and Mountaineering Federation defines a mountain like 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.600
 a projection of more than 300m. 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.960
 That is the height of the Eiffel tower. 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.240
 I do not think that is very high. 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.400
 Other people do not agree and say it should be 500m. 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.680
 or that the protrusions must change with height. 

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.680
 It's a mess. 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.430
 To be honest, even after my own research, I'm not sure. 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.620
 Even the people I asked to check my script said: 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.660
 "eh yes, in the basics this is correct, but technically ...." 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.200
 This is one of those times when mankind wants to categorize everything, 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.200
 against the messy reality. 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.450
 There are always edge cases, and actually every mountain is an edge case. 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.080
 I will quickly go back down before I get altitude sickness!
