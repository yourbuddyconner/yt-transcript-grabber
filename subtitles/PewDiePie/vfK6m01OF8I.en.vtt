00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:00.640
 if, 

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.480
 You ask people .. 

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:03.680
 These are two and a half cups :) 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:05.120
 And... 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.500
 You want people to get used to drinking a gallon of this drink a day 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.680
 True, it is people that .. 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.740
 People are malnourished 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.960
 What happens is that you are immune 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.740
 You do not fully feed 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.740
 That's why you see a significant change of people 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.740
 And so on 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.700
 *Laughter* 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.740
 Hi all D: 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.040
 I came back again 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:25.740
 With another video by Dr. Phil 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.020
 What kind of kids will you make fun of this week, Felix? 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.480
 His concern is no, no no 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.060
 They will not condemn to such an extent 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.820
 Okay? 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.040
 Today we will scoff at an adult woman. 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.600
 everybody 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.440
 Her name is Geely 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.160
 Jelly Juice inventor 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.820
 In fact, I do not know if her name is Geely, maybe it is, I do not know. 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.340
 I made this juice. 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.520
 Which is supposed to drink a gallon a day 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.020
 How much is the gallon equal? 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.020
 Gallons per liter 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.020
 Three points * laughs * 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.020
 Jesus Christ 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.440
 Just drink a gallon of this, you just have to drink gallons. 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.720
 Of wastewater. 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.800
 I will not explain much. Let's just watch. Because this is ridiculous 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.200
 You are actually feeding your body what 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.810
 They are undermined by parasites that are undermined by each of the different species 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.860
 The toxins that will attack you at the cellular level are classic 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.020
 An example of someone who has not studied anything just read online then 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.650
 He thinks he's an expert on the subject and I realize I'm doing this all the time 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.650
 It actually has molecular cell oral levels of toxins in your body 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.979
 They solve all their problems 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.970
 Gallon yes diet which is sir works up a gallon 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.890
 Today you say they will not feel good when they start 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.710
 Drink this you gonna be a ton of what you call aka waterfalls 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:57.060
 Explosive diarrhea Healing a kind of healing feeling has photos of people that 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.119
 Weapons and things may mature at all not because I did not get it 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.180
 I have only been doing this for a year so you do not have any proof of this really 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.619
 Growing on my veneer I saw creeping experiments even smaller they claim 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.120
 That this juice can do a lot of things will get into it all but one of the 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.450
 It is an outrageous claim that your limbs can grow even if you lose your arm 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.900
 Drink this juice Got one new shout You do not have any proof of that 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.280
 Really growing on the roads are relative I have seen quickly but evidence of everything relative 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.069
 Well this juice can make me forever 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:38.849
 Relative Guide I have not gotten that far yet but I mean I'm not dead yet I am 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:46.079
 Doctor. Phil are proving they are all relative I've done this for just a year how fine 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:56.489
 Is to strengthen your claim to this woman, my God if you have any training 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:02.069
 You have enough training well on the Internet and actually take the info yes I am 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.290
 You have enough training by reading mumbo-jumbo online this is all I need d. 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.360
 Phil does not need a Ph.D. to show that I am a genius not a medical education or a degree 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.180
 You do not have a medical license that is OK for you to have no scientific studies either 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.889
 You know clinical studies both human study animal studies do not have 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.060
 The brain is not okay Great you want to see what they left behind you see your 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.549
 Friends and family are dying of cancer disease and chronic illness is that what 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:37.519
 You want your claims are that you can re-grow this hair here is my God 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.639
 You can restore members' recovery from the way the drink does not even have anything 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:46.290
 Contains what you need to re-grow any of this but just ok 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:50.549
 Miracle Juice It 's not just a miracle juice Jelly juice and hardware 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.900
 William is right if you can heal your cut on your arm 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.799
 Right right system These are the cells that we grow it 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:03.329
 How not to have this jump to go so we go in a loop splitting your machine up when you are 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:12.290
 I cut myself up so that juice can grow my divine organs is my arms 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:19.859
 In an accident I could have potential Yes Drink Sorry you drink 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.960
 Healing from the inside so I drink this, this arm is only 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:34.500
 Go to re-grow because I want to know what exactly is what you say 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.070
 Re-examine it because look at it and you can not heal your pieces on your arm 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:44.550
 Right see Yes you re-grow it is likely to say that we live to 400 years 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:51.600
 Old you can live in it for hundreds of years I did this for a year okay I did 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.140
 Read them online I've done a d. An elephant that does 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:00.030
 You think you are a type of cancer doctor and is an anti cancer of any kind 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:06.120
 Cancer cancer is a fungus though and then this stuff really bothers me 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.690
 Because you got to the point because I heard stories about similar things where 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.430
 People will jump from cancer treatment to do a kind of juice 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.140
 Cleansing Healing All you have to do is eat properly and you do not need everything 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.590
 This medicine then people actually die of this kind of thing because 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.480
 They are fed up with the result of a doctor who does not give them what they want until they are 

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:32.790
 Taking a blind leap of faith by someone this literally is just hatching on people 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.860
 In pain people who suffer if you drink these Down syndrome all cells 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:43.020
 Just completely rework the absolutely basic features re-examine your features 

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.490
 Completely change your cuz like morphine when your bones grow 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:06:04.620
 It's painful and says that this will reverse homosexuality just way Yeah 

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:10.950
 She says so too this will reverse homosexuality yes you are 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.510
 Jack bet no more gayness how it ends like 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.169
 If you have something of these and you happen to be gay then you are 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:25.850
 You may as well just do this and see what it does to you that is just outrageous 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.340
 Do you think she applauds her or what this smile is doing - she is 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:35.320
 It really bothers me I feel like a person type 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.580
 It can take any damage you can ever tell her and anything 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:07:02.430
 It will only go so you will buy the Jews or what is sorry is fine 

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:11.080
 What the hell is happening is so planted by it I feel that this was 

00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.419
 I planted it I do not want to bury what I say I think you say this 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:24.460
 Reverse homosexuality is outrageous and attack can be yes no 

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.050
 She seems to have some critics or what she likes to call them all hateful 

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:33.880
 My haters are very well what they really do that everyone hates if you are 

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:38.160
 Every night a man appeared on YouTube and had her calls out and 

00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.300
 This is just someone wanting to do money and I found a place to do it 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:47.419
 Jeff's vacation is outside of YouTube's work that he knows 

00:07:47.419 --> 00:07:51.080
 You can get results and clicks and this will be the perfect thing for him 

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:58.400
 Make money from someone means I got her first man just man 

00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:01.970
 Because someone does it so their argument all seems to be wrong 

00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.419
 It is only because someone doing this makes fun of you incomplete argument 

00:08:05.419 --> 00:08:10.760
 The obsessed gel is a group of online trolls who have never tried jelly or juice 

00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:15.620
 Accusing her of trying to cheat people I know it is crazy to criticize people 

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:19.190
 Something they did not try to right especially something I described to you 

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:25.430
 It will give such tremendous pain juice can cure your arm if it gets cuts 

00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:30.380
 Do not do well you have cut your arm and drink juice how you can 

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:35.029
 Know if you are not trying how you can criticize it if you do not drink 

00:08:35.029 --> 00:08:40.159
 Juice is now a vacation Jeff's refuge could have been a fake flag on YouTube 

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:45.020
 Lee could have had me in the studio if you were following the Gillian protocol and you 

00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:49.760
 Drink about a gallon of this crap the day you will end up drinking four times 

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:54.410
 The recommended health amount of salt is not just that it does not do what it is 

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:58.310
 He thinks he is supposed to do it but it is also harmful because it is convincing 

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:02.770
 People give themselves sodium poisoning which can lead to confusion 

00:09:02.770 --> 00:09:09.350
 Zina fits the zombie drug and death so this Jews have a lot of salt in it 

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:14.570
 Such as drinking from the ocean and from it already has serious causes for others 

00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:21.290
 People negative effects raise very good point you have all these claims 

00:09:21.290 --> 00:09:30.530
 But you do not have data you do not have a basis for this you have some good people I am 

00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:36.140
 I looked at her statements by the way and I like this from our site 

00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.660
 Here is the change I passed by Julian's protocol that is me before 

00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:46.130
 This is after what I mean oh well by this and yet 

00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:50.420
 Sorry I did not see it properly lost a little weight like what it is 

00:09:50.420 --> 00:09:54.860
 The difference is so it's the only testimonial on this jelly juice you go to 

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:59.720
 It has its PDF what is normal what it is 

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.580
 Natural science behind the protocol so I wrote this scientific thing 

00:10:04.580 --> 00:10:08.390
 It starts with just a bunch of quotes which are always a great way if 

00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:12.110
 You have to colt to convince people to bring quotations from people who have 

00:10:12.110 --> 00:10:16.339
 Nothing really with your studies like Arthur Schopenhauer somehow 

00:10:16.339 --> 00:10:22.660
 Legalize your claims you've got to re-life any life you have not been 

00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:27.560
 Twelve years You have not renewed any parties you are not 

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:31.550
 Missing ellipse I d. Phil Hmmm How do you think this happened Why? 

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.240
 Do you think I'm not missing the parties huh? So Jeff asked her if you feel 

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:39.170
 Responsible for people who are suffering from this actual medical treatment 

00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.920
 The treatment here is the thing I actually teach people how to learn about them 

00:10:42.920 --> 00:10:45.950
 The body itself is about themselves to make their own decision that you feel responsible for 

00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:51.320
 People who follow your protocol and they are hurt feel it because they have 

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:55.940
 The opportunity to read my information to understand I have it all free so they are 

00:10:55.940 --> 00:11:00.200
 I had the opportunity to read my information and it was their fault to 

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.399
 Reading my information told her should help 

00:11:04.399 --> 00:11:08.300
 The damn fault was fine we heard about the juice 

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.899
 Yes yes yes Juices is very bad but let's hear about people who drank 

00:11:11.899 --> 00:11:19.279
 The juice that I got to experience the holy healing power on the juice I had 

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:23.300
 Chronic diseases have been in and out of hospitals and the entity constantly 

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.950
 Provided in ER since Jelly Juice was not forced to take any of the 

00:11:27.950 --> 00:11:33.440
 The drug that changed my life is very happy with the protocol is my life 

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:38.000
 When I discovered that I have psoriasis I decided to go to many different 

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.200
 I spent about $ 800 a month on it that I did not even drink 

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:46.160
 Juice It's a street in the water I guess what drinking water removes 

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:50.180
 I do not want to be this guy but you can see her clearly 

00:11:50.180 --> 00:11:54.200
 The outbreak is still in her skin she used the foundation of something buried like 

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:58.640
 What is the difference you put on more makeup not only benefit from 

00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:02.880
 Jelly juice but the rest of my family also my son has autism 

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:08.940
 Since ADHD has been on the juice Jelly has been tested his son is in 

00:12:08.940 --> 00:12:14.750
 Moderate autism before that showed severe autism symptoms 

00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:20.400
 Do not give this to your children, my God her daughter has risen her degrees 

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:27.030
 The higher the degrees the chili juice will not only cure your son's autism will also 

00:12:27.030 --> 00:12:32.190
 Help improve their scores everyone I do not know how they can not sell on 

00:12:32.190 --> 00:12:36.900
 Daily juice and chili juice did a wonderful thing for me as I feel happier 

00:12:36.900 --> 00:12:40.980
 I feel younger I feel that you went through a midlife crisis and you've got it 

00:12:40.980 --> 00:12:45.020
 More than the best congratulations I've been thanks to 

00:12:45.020 --> 00:12:48.810
 Where I doubt my doubt that I doubt it 

00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:52.890
 They have been paid only because they are paying off until when 

00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:59.360
 Rachid I've been doing this protocol I started on June 30th of 

00:12:59.360 --> 00:13:04.410
 2017 Do you have a large body reaction when it started oh 

00:13:04.410 --> 00:13:12.390
 Sure you do have these waterfalls Oh sure this brings us to 

00:13:12.390 --> 00:13:15.540
 The pain part of the treatment is what they remember 

00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:20.850
 The waterfall certainly has these waterfalls Oh you give it definitely 

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:25.200
 Diarrhea is not violent diarrhea is not called waterfalls because they are different 

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.350
 Various context of intention and different results okay it is not 

00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:32.400
 She diarrhea waterfalls waterfalls 

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.160
 It's called waterfalls because it has different context of different faith 

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:39.050
 Different results okay explosive area 

00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:50.510
 How exactly your Boa is violently but is supposed to help your immune system 

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:56.030
 I have a question I tried not 

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:03.840
 Yes you can look like this huh well you did not try it why you hate it 

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.720
 Looks fine to me perfectly healthy you do not have 

00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.160
 Try to dare to criticize Let me ask you something that you think if 

00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:14.100
 If you have cut your arm drink this will grow again 

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.500
 I'll do it unless we see it happen 

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:34.470
 I do but we have not seen it happen did not prove it as you see 

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:40.140
 Here of the reviews people like chili juice is the best everyone trusts 

00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:43.200
 Chili juice is the only positive review of Anne 

00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:47.880
 Who says she feels she is alive causes her to suffer from two strokes but 

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:51.750
 When I even complained here this is very annoying to you 

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:55.680
 See these people these poor people tried jelly juice and suffered 

00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.150
 Health issues actually have severe health issues because of it because it is 

00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:04.890
 A lot of salt which can cause experience strokes with chili juice was terrible 

00:15:04.890 --> 00:15:10.350
 Taste like a swamp water you always call it the sewage whenever you take more 

00:15:10.350 --> 00:15:12.510
 A little bit whenever I'm in a bath 

00:15:12.510 --> 00:15:18.030
 I had only a problem in my kidney hurt the pancreas hurt I had a headache 

00:15:18.030 --> 00:15:22.589
 I can not get rid of the pain cramps I felt there was a rise in my head 

00:15:22.589 --> 00:15:27.420
 My blood pressure was very high and my face was hanging down I was carrying my words 

00:15:27.420 --> 00:15:31.800
 I would have had a blow to Gillian and my hand was executed and was pricked 

00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:36.270
 My fingers could not move them were stuck together I talked to 

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:39.100
 The doctor says I think we need an MRI 

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:44.950
 They were able to see definitively the fact that there were two strokes of Jesus 

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:49.720
 Christ had a good reaction you should worry about but I have 

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:53.800
 Lots of lawyers say you're supposed to keep drinking that juice 

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:59.110
 It was just symptoms I did not die I said I did not die I'm supposed to die 

00:15:59.110 --> 00:16:05.830
 Proof of your theory I mean yes it obviously does not have to prove anything 

00:16:05.830 --> 00:16:09.760
 Let's hear from the doctor what the real doctor should say about jolly juice 

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:16.000
 The doctor thanks you for being here. These are the things you would like to take 

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.940
 Drink Thank you No thanks Well what to do 

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:26.680
 Think about these claims that the amount of sodium in one cup as reported 

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:32.170
 The earlier is two to three times what the daily division is for normal 

00:16:32.170 --> 00:16:36.220
 Individual if the individual has risk factors such as hypertension or kidneys 

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:40.720
 The disease is then up to four to five times the recommended amount per second 

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:46.000
 The point is that these waterfalls diarrhea is a point that you do not lose 

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:54.400
 Diarrhea in diarrhea is completely wrong it's not a loss it's not 

00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:01.780
 Diarrhea get it true it is not diarrhea is not what diarrhea Diarrhea 

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:09.550
 An idiot gets it the right way that says it's so angry you say you guys long 

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:15.340
 There is no yes but you do not think it is obvious that unfortunately we have 

00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:19.390
 Level and body of information have limitations that we do not all have 

00:17:19.390 --> 00:17:24.550
 No answer she does not have all Jolie's answer Jolie's juice has everything 

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:29.380
 Everyone answers I think what we need to do here is jolly juice slicing 

00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:34.210
 I do not say we should be okay by any means but it would be interesting to see 

00:17:34.210 --> 00:17:40.630
 Everything will grow now I'm not a medical expert okay but it seems to me 

00:17:40.630 --> 00:17:45.340
 That everyone just wants a free pass everything everyone wants the next day 

00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:50.010
 Something miraculous this is what you'll get a loose cheerleader this one 

00:17:50.010 --> 00:17:55.530
