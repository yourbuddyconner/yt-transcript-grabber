00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.436
 How do I have an exciting news before the film starts? 

00:00:03.436 --> 00:00:09.175
 For the first time, Marzia and I have a new work together with our own brand. 

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:10.643
 Called TSUKI 

00:00:10.643 --> 00:00:14.214
 That is, this Tsuki on my body is the meaning of "moon" in Japanese. 

00:00:14.214 --> 00:00:17.170
 Yes, we are obsessed with Japanese culture. 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:20.487
 This is a neutral size so you can wear it for both boys and girls. 

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:24.224
 Or the monster in the night, you can still wear it. 

00:00:24.224 --> 00:00:27.894
 We also have some home products that are original designs. 

00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:30.296
 Are all designed by us 

00:00:30.296 --> 00:00:36.136
 One of the things I really want is the logo on the sleeve. 

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:40.473
 I really like this one. We also have an oversize (loose version) cap T. 

00:00:40.473 --> 00:00:44.611
 Very comfortable material is very unique and unique 

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:49.315
 We also have a pink short sleeve with a logo and a cap. 

00:00:49.315 --> 00:00:53.153
 I love this hat because it can finally be worn on my damn head. 

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:58.925
 We still have if you think you are as cool and cool as me. 

00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:01.928
 It’s the beret! That's right! Hehehe 

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:06.533
 I dare say you didn't guess it! We still have cool socks. 

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:10.570
 There is also a calendar and our selection of spice candles 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.473
 Then go shopping, this is a limited edition 

00:01:13.473 --> 00:01:16.142
 So if you sell it, it’s sold out. 

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:18.511
 You will... Anyway, I’ll buy it now. 

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.580
 Go shopping, I am very proud of the goods. 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.783
 I am very proud to be able to produce goods with Marzia. 

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:26.820
 The process is very fun, I hope you like it. 

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:31.925
 I think we all agree that YouTube is very * 

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:35.362
 Good YouTube is the best, of course. 

00:01:35.362 --> 00:01:39.650
 What do you think I want to say? Ha.... 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.538
 Today I am going to browse the "*" on YouTube. I can't tell it. 

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:48.308
 Today we are going to browse some of the best videos. 

00:01:48.308 --> 00:01:52.450
 And the most friendly message on this site. 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.981
 You know me, I care about the disadvantaged groups. 

00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:58.985
 Even named those smaller channels to give them some confidence. 

00:01:58.985 --> 00:02:02.822
 Know that one day will become the next PewDiePie 

00:02:02.822 --> 00:02:05.792
 I am killing the little ones, let's continue. 

00:02:05.792 --> 00:02:10.960
 Ah, with a perfect example, don’t like my movie anymore. 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.367
 Joey Veilleux's film, he will love you. 

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:19.372
 "Hey guys don't like my movie" 

00:02:19.372 --> 00:02:21.410
 "Sorry, I am not your mother." 

00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:22.542
 Oh! 

00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:23.943
 Don't say it again 

00:02:24.878 --> 00:02:28.181
 "If you don't like it, I swear I will blow you up" 

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.352
 Hahaha, I like this angle is great. 

00:02:33.887 --> 00:02:38.725
 If you don’t like it, I swear, I will die. 

00:02:38.725 --> 00:02:41.127
 You see the muscles of your muscles. 

00:02:41.127 --> 00:02:42.128
 Oh! 

00:02:42.128 --> 00:02:45.799
 For scholars and gentlemen, YouTube is indeed a friendly place. 

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:49.269
 "Give me a roll!" 

00:02:50.337 --> 00:02:53.340
 Subscribe not like 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.207
 awesome! 

00:02:54.207 --> 00:02:58.311
 What good movie on this wonderful website? 

00:02:58.311 --> 00:02:59.579
 You are looking for anything! 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:03.717
 How do you lift the blue chair on the ground? 

00:03:03.717 --> 00:03:06.353
 Well~ It seems very interesting, let’s take a look. 

00:03:10.824 --> 00:03:13.293
 "Hey everyone" 

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:16.596
 - "Thank you for coming to the page of the Bluetooth" - not bad 

00:03:16.596 --> 00:03:23.803
 "Today I am going to teach you how to lift the fallen chair up" 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:25.505
 It’s not bad. 

00:03:25.505 --> 00:03:29.676
 "You just need to lift it gently" 

00:03:31.478 --> 00:03:35.248
 "If the chair doesn't get up, don't worry about it." 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.623
 Allen, your chair is not bad, but you probably haven’t seen my chair. 

00:03:43.623 --> 00:03:49.362
 As long as the US dollar 399, if it falls, you can call it back! 

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:51.531
 US$399 very good price 

00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:55.869
 You know that this chair really won’t fall, even if you 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.372
 Ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah 

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:04.110
 YouTube is really a great site but the wonderful part of the community 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:07.914
 Of course, I am talking about YouTube's message area. They are the best! 

00:04:07.914 --> 00:04:12.520
 The most friendly and wise area on this site. 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:14.788
 You can find everything by browsing the YouTube message area. 

00:04:14.788 --> 00:04:16.756
 "Listen to this music in Australia" 

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:20.260
 "Too cool, thank you for your support!" 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.129
 "I didn't say that I like it or that he is good." 

00:04:24.531 --> 00:04:27.701
 "Sounds very * mentally retarded" 

00:04:30.403 --> 00:04:34.841
 Wow, creators and fans interact on YouTube is the best 

00:04:34.841 --> 00:04:36.343
 YouTube is too motivating 

00:04:36.343 --> 00:04:40.547
 Someone decided to upload Michael Sarah's face... 

00:04:40.547 --> 00:04:43.616
 Isn't it great to see everyone on this network so creative? 

00:04:43.616 --> 00:04:45.618
 "I am a child, I am nine years old" 

00:04:45.618 --> 00:04:47.454
 "I am nine and a half years old" 

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.890
 "You, he* shut up" 

00:04:52.792 --> 00:04:53.793
 I am a bit too mean. 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.629
 But sometimes you have to give the Buddha a little bit of color. 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:58.932
 They always want to use your fart to blow you up 

00:04:58.932 --> 00:05:01.401
 You got him * shut up 

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:03.870
 "It’s good to laugh at the big tooth thief" 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.506
 "How many (嗝) chromosomes do you have?" 

00:05:06.506 --> 00:05:08.208
 "I am sure more than you" 

00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:12.212
噢~ He was smashed by the murder! 

00:05:12.212 --> 00:05:16.983
 Damn you can't provoke Wizzy PvP, he has super chromosomes. 

00:05:16.983 --> 00:05:19.352
 He will take you back to the Stone Age. 

00:05:19.352 --> 00:05:22.722
 God, that guy is too strong, too embarrassing. 

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:26.593
 I am proud of being able to prosper on this wonderful platform. 

00:05:26.593 --> 00:05:30.530
 Great, I just want to spend the rest of my life here. 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:36.469
 "I am very sorry to inform this news that PewDiePie has cancer." 

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:40.573
 "But he doesn't want his "Ding" readers to know" 

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:43.443
 "Because it is too big for them." 

00:05:43.443 --> 00:05:46.246
 "What? You liar" 

00:05:46.246 --> 00:05:53.253
 "I am serious, I am his doctor, I diagnosed it." 

00:05:53.253 --> 00:05:54.187
 "I am sorry" 

00:05:54.187 --> 00:05:59.459
 "Why? Bad things happen to me!!!" 

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:03.530
 The DOM is completely correct. He is my doctor. 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.667
 I was surprised that he obviously leaked the patient's secret. 

00:06:07.667 --> 00:06:12.500
 No one should know what he learned when he played with my eggs. 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.274
 But Brett doesn't want to be discouraged! I will be fine. 

00:06:14.274 --> 00:06:16.900
 Whether or not my testicles 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:20.413
 I still shoot the movie because I love to take YouTube videos too. 

00:06:20.413 --> 00:06:24.517
 Even if I have a life-threatening illness, I will not quit! 

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:27.420
 I want to continue shooting 

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.956
 So that I can die faster 

00:06:29.956 --> 00:06:32.292
 "Does anyone know this song?" 

00:06:32.292 --> 00:06:33.660
 "know" 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.461
 "Thanks!" 

00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:35.895
 "you are welcome" 

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:40.300
 Isn’t it great to see YouTube’s netizens working together? 

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.671
 Like a big group! 喔~ Too motivating~ 

00:06:44.671 --> 00:06:47.841
 I really hope that my netizens are also so helpful. 

00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:50.910
 My netizen is simply a poison tongue. 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:52.450
 Oh... 

00:06:52.450 --> 00:07:00.860
 I kicked the wall and played for 12 minutes and 29 seconds until my dad told me to stop. 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.224
 Finally, there is a successor to PewDiePie. Let’s take a look. 

00:07:13.466 --> 00:07:16.636
 What is this? How to be a son? 

00:07:16.636 --> 00:07:19.739
 Does his dad really come? 

00:07:28.314 --> 00:07:29.820
 Oh 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.455
 (I can not hear you) 

00:07:38.425 --> 00:07:40.660
 Wow 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:43.797
 We found the best videos on YouTube! 

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:49.350
 We really reached the peak! Congratulations to the calf man you won 

00:07:49.350 --> 00:07:49.969
 This prize! 

00:07:50.870 --> 00:07:55.800
 Can't wait for the calf man to have any new work in the future 

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:58.178
 I like the whole movie too much. 

00:07:58.178 --> 00:08:01.470
 Look at the whole department like it! (He didn't finish it) 

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.818
 "No, I just want to watch the game movie of Black ops 3!" 

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:07.320
 "Let your screen narrow!" 

00:08:07.954 --> 00:08:12.392
 Stupid woman gets out! Can you let this lady roll out of the camera? 

00:08:12.392 --> 00:08:13.993
 I just want to see that flower! 

00:08:13.993 --> 00:08:18.932
 Wow, those roses, wow, is the enlarged double bed? 

00:08:19.999 --> 00:08:21.201
 Oh 

00:08:21.201 --> 00:08:24.237
 Who said that whites have no culture? 

00:08:24.237 --> 00:08:29.420
 Not very good, thanks to YouTubebb for whites to find their culture. 

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:30.777
 Deserve our pride 

00:08:30.777 --> 00:08:33.947
 Diary 30th day: Superheroes are going to school 

00:08:33.947 --> 00:08:37.450
 The thirtieth day of the diary: being humanized 

00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.585
 Let’s take a look 

00:08:38.585 --> 00:08:43.690
 "Everyone is ready to go to school early" 

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:48.928
 "These are earrings" 

00:08:55.135 --> 00:08:58.371
 No, I can't stand it. 

00:08:58.371 --> 00:09:02.575
 YouTube is a movie element like a bang! 

00:09:03.276 --> 00:09:07.947
 But only the best and best looks will surface. 

00:09:07.947 --> 00:09:09.820
 Just like me! 

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:12.719
 "Does anyone think this?" 

00:09:12.719 --> 00:09:15.655
 "The aliens are very hot on Jar Jar's fart?" 

00:09:15.655 --> 00:09:20.226
 "The aliens look so feminine and sexy" 

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:25.365
 "There is also his way of farting and the way he turns to show off." 

00:09:25.365 --> 00:09:29.703
 "It's like inviting him to look a little closer" 

00:09:29.703 --> 00:09:33.139
 "The first time I watched this film is very small, then I will" 

00:09:33.139 --> 00:09:36.476
 No no no no 

00:09:36.476 --> 00:09:43.183
 Too classic is completely a legend in the history of YouTube 

00:09:43.183 --> 00:09:46.720
 "Come back to PewDiePie, I have to do housework." 

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:50.924
 Where did he go? Please come back to Samuel Martinez! 

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:55.195
 I want to find him. I want to meet him and make a film. It will be awesome. 

00:09:55.195 --> 00:09:57.997
 I want to know why he can go so long. 

00:09:57.997 --> 00:09:59.132
 "I am coming back" 

00:09:59.132 --> 00:10:02.836
 Finally! This message should be carried forward. 

00:10:02.836 --> 00:10:06.539
 This is a great classic 

00:10:06.539 --> 00:10:12.120
 Ten things that will happen after Queen Elizabeth’s death 

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.848
 "Big Ben, his * exploded" 

00:10:14.848 --> 00:10:16.950
 We can't be sure, really 

00:10:16.950 --> 00:10:22.122
 I really like this because it really shows how important the film thumbnail is. 

00:10:22.122 --> 00:10:27.460
 If you really want to know what they want to say? 

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:30.163
 Most of the thumbnails you made will only show that you are an idiot. 

00:10:30.163 --> 00:10:33.366
 Not including me, my thumbnail is the most flawless 

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:34.834
 Thank you for praising me. 

00:10:34.834 --> 00:10:40.106
 Five live masters of the "Fortress Heroes" accidentally swearing my God, no 

00:10:41.174 --> 00:10:46.112
 This is too much, that's why we are restricted to advertising 

00:10:46.112 --> 00:10:49.616
 Everyone is saying that I am the chief culprit in the restriction of advertising. 

00:10:49.616 --> 00:10:53.286
 Have you heard me swearing? Have you heard me say * *? 

00:10:53.853 --> 00:10:57.657
 Oh, you are too disappointed, I thought you were not so superficial. 

00:10:57.657 --> 00:11:00.627
 Wow, are we not benefiting a lot today? 

00:11:00.627 --> 00:11:04.998
 YouTube is a great site full of beauty 

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.867
 I don't know how anyone thinks he is a *place 

00:11:07.867 --> 00:11:09.536
 This is not the truth 

00:11:09.536 --> 00:11:13.340
 If you are proud of yourself as a YouTube user, press like 

00:11:13.340 --> 00:11:16.843
 Maybe check out my other similar videos. 

00:11:16.843 --> 00:11:22.582
 And thank you very much to YouTube... poop YT... 

00:11:22.582 --> 00:11:25.719
 I am not swearing, unlike the live masters who play &lt;Fortress Hero&gt; 

00:11:25.719 --> 00:11:27.587
 But let me guess you guess where this started. 

00:11:27.587 --> 00:11:30.523
 That is, someone on Twitter has a similar meme. 

00:11:30.523 --> 00:11:34.661
 As usual, brothers and fists, everyone brahhhh
