00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.850
 We have only a few options to conduct a scientific experiment in the absence of gravity. 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.090
 The test can be done aboard an international spacecraft, but it is very expensive and achievable if you do not have close friends in the space agency. 

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.639

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.490
 The experiment can be placed in cubesat and launched into orbit, but it is also expensive. 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:18.800

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.460
 We can experiment with weightless aircraft that accelerate to the ground with a precise acceleration that causes weight loss.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.921
 But that requires a lot of initial preparations, secondary costs unrelated to the experiment, and burning of the fuel. Fortunately, there is a last option ....

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.530
 This tower is a free fall tower at the University of Bremen in Germany. 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.610
 Inside it contains a completely empty giant compartment. 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.460
 As the pumps emptied the room from the air within 90 minutes, which means that the room is ready to conduct free fall experiments.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.060
 There is a vehicle to fall. 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:58.920
 In this experiment, we study the procedure of separating the charges in the case of static electricity.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.360
 In the free fall period, we will launch glass granules in an intense direction. We have plenty of time to track down tiny particles and do the exact measurements we can not do in normal gravity.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.909
 The acceleration caused by the Earth's gravity is about 10 meters per second per second, and in the absence of air reluctance, the vehicle falls too fast. 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.869

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.880
 In the first second after the escape, the capsule drops 10 meters 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.380
 The next second, 20 meters. 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.470

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.840
 And then reach the ground after passing the full length of the tower. 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.580
 For another second, we have to lift the experiment 50 meters, half the current height. 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.410
 For another second, we have to lift the experiment 50 meters, half the current height. 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.100
 But there is something very clever that can be done ... The experiment can be started first before falling. 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.670
 We first put the experiment into a fall vehicle. 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.939

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.289
 We throw the vehicle up at close to 30 ground gravity for 200 milliseconds, and then get about 10 seconds of weightlessness.

 The slowdown that follows this fall at the end of the experiment is estimated at about 35 to 50 land.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.310
 You should imagine what happens in the event of an acceleration starting for a long time, causing the crash of the vehicle or roof of the tower collision situation, which could damage the vacuum within the tower, which is our most important.

 We balance the weight center of the vehicle along the vertical axis within the limits of possible accuracy, by hanging the weight blocks in certain places on the cart.

 External forces are the same in case of free fall, even if the direction of the movement changes before us.
