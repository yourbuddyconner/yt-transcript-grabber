00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.680
 This is a typical British terraced house. 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.130
 It was built around the turn of the twentieth century 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.250
 of brick, cement and a lot of handwork. 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:12.200
 Kitchen, living room and a staircase in the middle 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.890
 that brings you upstairs to two bedrooms and a bathroom. 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.349
 And although the exact details may differ 

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.319
 one in five houses in Britain looks something like this, 

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:24.199
 neatly in a row. 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.220
 The problem, however, is; houses like this are not built to save energy 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.689
 or to keep the heat on a cold winter day. 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.080
 Energy saving was not really a thing a century ago 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.300
 and while there are a lot of ideas about modernizing older homes 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.560
 How do you find out which of those ideas work? 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.760
 How do you do a controlled experiment? 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.010
 if every house is different and the weather changes daily? 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:47.970
 Would not it be great if you, let's say 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.370
 the sun could command? 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.620
 We are here in the Salford Energy House 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.240
 that the only building is in a climate-controlled room. 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.329
 The idea was actually to look at how one 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.170
 to make a Victorian house more energy-efficient 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.390
 For example, if you subject a boiler to a test 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.460
 then it is in a laboratory and X% will be efficient. 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.780
 While, if that boiler puts in a house or complete system 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.920
 it will be influenced by all sorts of other things 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.990
 such as the building materials, radiators, the way it is operated, 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.520
 so understand how things react when they are in a complete home 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.250
 is very, very important. 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.139
 This is not a modern copy of an old terraced house, built with new techniques. 

00:01:29.139 --> 00:01:32.430
 This is an authentic corner house, originally in Manchester. 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.030
 It was demolished brick by brick and rebuilt here 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.859
 in an environment-controlled test room at the University of Salford. 

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:43.000
 We needed the help of a 70-year-old bricklayer, 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.270
 because the way of bricklaying during Victorian times 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.499
 today is no longer used. 

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:51.630
 He told us that he last had that brickwork that way when he was still in training. 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.780
 The house is full of hundreds of sensors. 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.280
 Every device is monitored separately. 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.599
 We can even simulate human activity. 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:03.499
 We have controlled door closers, robots actually, 

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:08.420
 who can imitate the opening and closing of doors, windows, refrigerators and so on. 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.560
 We can switch household appliances on and off. 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.330
 We can check the weather in this room. 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.850
 Next to it is a room with a huge water tank 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.990
 and there are whole layers of piping around the room 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.310
 spraying rain against the house 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.490
 because rain never falls straight down but comes from the side 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:28.560
 And we even have a snow machine, 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.490
 and a wind turbine, 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.640
 and a whole lighting system 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:39.070
 These are heat radiation lamps connected to a lighting installation as used in theaters 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:41.920
 so that the sun can reach all sides of the house. 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.340
 All these things are very important for the functioning of a building. 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.400
 At the first big test we did, where we took care of the whole house, 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.010
 we insulated the walls, improved the doors and the windows 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.570
 and the floor adjusted. 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.670
 We have been able to reduce energy consumption by 60%. 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.210
 Concessions will always have to be made with this kind of experiment 

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.680
 And yes, warm up and cool a building 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.040
 while it is in a different building 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.560
 is not very energy-intensive in itself, 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.380
 but compared to other industrial processes 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.590
 it is not that bad yet. 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.900
 And if you use a little bit of energy here, we can make hundreds of homes more efficient 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.940
 Then it is probably worth it. 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.260
 Thanks to everyone at the Energy House 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:22.030
 and the University of Salford School of Built Environment.
