00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.220
 I am on Marylebone Road in London. The building behind me is now the Landmark Hotel, 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.240
 but for many years this was the headquarters of British Rail: 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.320
 the government organization that managed all railways in the country. 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.119
 And apparently, in the 1970s, they also had ideas for space travel. Because they took a patent ... 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.180
 a flying saucer. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.920
 I do not make a joke. This was not just a slightly derailed employee. 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.180
 The patent speaks about the inventor, with the fantastic name Charles Osmond Frederick. 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.460
 But it is registered under the company. 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.400
 They have paid an agent to submit it for them. 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.820
 There was more than a year between the first report and the final submission. 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.080
 And it is detailed. It goes on and on how they will use lasers 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:41.440
 to ignite material for nuclear fusion, then with magnetic fields to bend those particles 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.200
 and use them as a drive. 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.280
 I mean, physics is at best questionable and incredibly unrealistic. 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.640
 Every now and then this is unearthed and shown because it is completely ridiculous and optimistic. 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.640
 But: this patent has been granted. 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.700
 Patent offices are terribly overloaded with years of overdue work. 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.740
 For each submission one must search through the catalog to see that nobody else has already submitted something similar. 

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.740
 Researchers are not experts in the areas they are looking at; 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.200
 they simply check whether an idea is original. 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.180
 Look at the published patents: mainly large companies ... 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.560
 who produce small variations on old ideas. 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.700
 but sometimes you see a lone inventor applying for a patent from his garden shed 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.320
 for a bizarre idea or an unrealistic dream. 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.210
 And although it is the official policy of both the UK and the US Patent Office ... 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.860
 to reject ridiculous ideas like a peretuum mobile, 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.440
 you can apply for a patent for something that is not yet possible, but in the future perhaps. 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.840
 And at the height of the space race, after we went from Sputnik to a man in 10 years, 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:47.180
 Was it possible that British Rail would have a flotilla of flying saucers in the late 1990s? 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:51.700
 Probably not, but that decision was not for the patent researcher. 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.920
 Assuming you renew your patent regularly, you have up to 20 years to make a profit, 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.800
 before it expires and everyone can make your invention. 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.200
 That also happened with the flying saucer, so if any of you wants to make a spacecraft, 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.640
 driven by a laser-controlled fusion reactor, then it is allowed. Northeast in Great Britain. 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.580
 But let's be honest: that's never going to happen - 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.380
