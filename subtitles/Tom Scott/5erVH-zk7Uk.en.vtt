00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.819
 This is Francis Dam St, outside Los Angeles. Or better, what's left of it. More than 50 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.500
 meters high, holding back 100,000 tons of water. Until it collapsed disastrous 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.320
 in 1928, twelve hours after her chief engineer had said that the cracks in it were nothing 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.029
 be concerned about. 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:21.560
 the engine chief in question was William Mulholland. It is one of the reasons that LA 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.949
 is the size and scale is: Mulholland Drive, home from the stars, is named after him, and 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.070
 his career before the dam fall was striking. He was in charge of projects that have deviated 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.980
 a river, and caused what became known as California Water Wars as locals tried to 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.910
 dynamite and destroy the infrastructure that was pulled all by water away from them 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.260
 farms. At the opening ceremony of the Los Angeles Waterworks, close to here, like water 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.879
 cascaded down towards rising the city, Mulholland stated to the mayor of Los Angeles "has 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.850
 it is, take it. "And they. Remember, Los Angeles was just a small town among many 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.649
 in the valley at that moment - but its statute does not allow it to provide excess water for 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.750
 someone else, so the only way for other nearby cities to get access to this was to give up 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.220
 their independence and become part of LA. 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.909
 And this may have continued, perhaps Burbank, Pasadena, Anaheim, other cities they have 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.040
 The special local government today can all be part of a big city ... if it was not 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.030
 for Francis Dam St. 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.920
 The main theory of collapse is that the foundations were ill: in the solid bed, 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.689
 the dam would have been completely safe - but it was built on permeable ground, so weight 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.310
 the water kept behind the dam started to seep through and soften the ground under it. there 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.030
 there had always been some cracks in the dam; it was normal for time, concrete 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.810
 can do it as it determines. But I was beginning to get out, leaks are beginning to grow. Mulholland 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.310
 and his assistant inspected the dam, and decided that maintenance needed, but the situation 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.649
 it was not desperate. 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:58.520
 Well, maintenance could not have helped: The dam was twelve hours away from the collapse. but 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.840
 evacuation from the following areas may have saved hundreds of lives. Just before midnight, that 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.149
 gave catastrophic paths. 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.450
 And as the investigative courts handed them their decisions, and as the last permanent piece of 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.480
 dams were destroyed and cleansed to stop sightseers and people taking terrific souvenirs, 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.560
 cities that have not been eaten by LA yet: Beverly Hills, Santa Monica, many 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.060
 others - determined that Los Angeles can not be trusted with its water projects. All those 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.430
 refused to join, and instead they formed it was called a "Water District", with LA - they 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.170
 took common control of any project like this in the future. The dam fall does not just end up 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:38.030
 Career and Mulholland; it ended the assimilation of other cities in LA. We can talk about 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.319
 urban stretch, everything in the valley, like Los Angeles, but it's not: it's special 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.810
 special cities and goverements, and one reason is this valley and dam that 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.310
 is no longer there. 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.269
 The incredible shooting the man in this video was from these people. Go see their channels. 

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:54.560
 This is Ed by Media Giraffe. 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.950
 You can see all 4K footage from this shoot 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.840
 and some others except on his channel. 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.650
 And this is Alex from the Gear Hoard, 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:02.400
 if you want airplane reviews and giveaways, 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:03.580
 go to subscribe to his channel. 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.970
 And there's a round to sign up here somewhere to mine as well, so ... 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.280
 Thank you guys! It was wonderful!
