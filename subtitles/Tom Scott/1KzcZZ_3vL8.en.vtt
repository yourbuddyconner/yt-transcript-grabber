00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.540
 This is 'the Technical Difficulties' and we play 'Citation Needed'. 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.640
 With me today, he reads books you know, this is Chris Joel. 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.940
 [muttering] There is something between my teeth ... 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.440
 Everyone's favorite Gary Brannan, Gary Brannan. 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.640
 Enter a power cable here. 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:13.260
 True? 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:14.680
 Oh, you know ... 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.460
 You really went for it ... I did not think you would finish it. 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.480
 I did not know you really went into it. 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.200
 Urgh! 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.340
 And the most bouncing man on the internet, Matt Gray. 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.700
 Bienvenue (Welcome), YouTube! 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.260
 For me I have an article from Wikipedia and these gentlemen can not see it. 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.460
 For every fact they have, they get a point and a bell. [thing] 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.180
 And there is a special prize for particularly good answers, and that is ... [Mystery biscuits] 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.660
 Today we are going to talk about 'Project Cybersyn'. 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.800
 Oh! Oh…! Oh ... There are many cyber sins (sin = sin in English). 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.880
 Is it a campaign by the Church of England to cleanse robots of their sins? 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.660
 No, and it is spelled as SY N. 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.400
 Oh come on! This is a book or something ... 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.840
 No, this is really true. But I admit; it sounds a bit scifi-like. 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.920
 So is it 'sin' or 'synthetic'? 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.300
 It's an abbreviation of something, so I'll give you a point. [thing] 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.080
 Ah, synergy ... 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.040
 Point! [thing] 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.540
 [jubilant] Wahey, uh-huh! 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:06.220
 It is indeed a porte-manteau of cybernetics and synergy. 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.100
 Are government policies somewhere? 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.020
 Ooh! Yes, here, a point. [thing] 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.260
 Does anyone want to guess where in the world ... 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.800
 AMERICA! 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.120
 Which area? 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:17.580
 [poor South American accent] The south. 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.020
 Well, if I would say the ... 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.960
 Whichever answer was good, that is the one I mean. 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.400
 Yes Gary, take a point here. It is in South America. [thing] 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:26.900
 Yes! 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:27.640
 Chili. 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.880
 No, I'm fine; I have a sweater on. (chili sounds like chilly, which means cold) 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.560
 I have tried hard to pronounce it as 'chilly'. So you would not make that joke ... 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.720
 Does not matter! 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.120
 It happens anyway; just live with it. 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.680
 To be honest, everything that did was pretentious to you. 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:42.320
 Yes. 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.800
 [chic accent] 'Chile'. 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.040
 [chic accent] 'Chile', I think that's how you want it to be pronounced. 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200
 I think it is pronounced 'CHYLE'. 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.180
 That is what Jimi Hendrix says. 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:52.820
 That is what we do. 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.680
 It is not 'Voodoo Chilli'. Or maybe that should be the case. 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.860
 [chic accent] It is 'Voodoo Chilé'. 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.500
 [chic accent] 'Voodoo Chilé'? 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.520
 [chic accent] 'Voodoo Chilé'. 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.900
 You already know that it's one of those sleeveless jackets. 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.620
 But you become a zombie when you pull it. 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:03.920
 A voodoo waistcoat! 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.360
 I am so soft and warm and ... BRAIN! 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.580
 Chile is at the bottom left in America right? 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.940
 Indeed, right at the bottom. 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:13.860
 Down in America! 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.900
 At the bottom left in America. You navigate like me. 

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.280
 It's that long right? 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.780
 Yes. 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.840
 It is the long thin that goes all the way down on one side. 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.600
 We've been to school. 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.060
 When are we talking about, when do you expect ... 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.680
 Lunch time! 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.480
 Half 3! 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.840
 We both went for the same, did not we? 

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.080
 It's like those bloopers of a baseball game, where you see two men running for the same ball ... 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.740
 What decade ... 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.480
 would you expect 'Project Cybersyn'? 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.120
 If this was in the 80 years I am disappointed. Seventies? 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.360
 You will be disappointed, because it was in the seventies. Here, a point Matt! [thing] 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.480
 Do we make South American robots? 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.540
 1971 to 1973. 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.320
 Is that when they took over everything and killed everyone? 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.100
 No… 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.740
 South America at that time, that is a questionable joke to make ... 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.640
 That is what the project ended; it was a military coup. 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.520
 That destroyed the control room. 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.300
 So, yes ... But (!) 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.360
 It was a military [pigeon sound] 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.480
 Military coup ... (coo is pigeon sound in english) 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.960
 Pigeons are coming! Release the robots! 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.560
 Sir, the robots are not ready yet. The pigeons pick them in a thousand pieces! Oh what a world ... 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.520
 Sir, the robots ... 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.240
 HIS pigeons ... 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:19.200
 [dove sound] - Oh my god! 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.340
 I can not take off my glasses; I have lenses. 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:22.300
 [dove sound with robot sounds] 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.980
 My God! 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.940
 [robot buzz with pigeons roekoe] 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.560
 [softly] I do not like this ... 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.980
 What I am looking for in a robot pigeon are two things ... 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.440
 1. Someone has to work very long to perfect the way of walking of pigeons ... 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.840
 so that their heads go from front to back on their walking rhythm. 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.980
 That's easy. You just do a new link on their neck and attach it to their foreheads. 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.500
 That is a modern gyroscope that should try not to compensate for it. 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.340
 And the other is, they will still make sure that it picks up cigarette butts. 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.000
 Every pigeon on the square moves in a choir. 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.640
 Aaah! 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.320
 That would be scary. 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.080
 Oh, now we have gone too far. 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:49.440
 Laser eyes. 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.760
 Yes of course. They can not hold on because they have wings! 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.520
 It does not fly with his wings to fly. It would do that with rocket motors in its buttocks. 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.620
 For those who now switch on, Project Cybersyn ... is not about robotic pigeons. 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.400
 I can only see a whole Trafalgar Square full of pigeons ... 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.000
 that just stop, spread their wings and take off all. 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:08.220
 at the same time. 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.020
 That is a beautiful ... Compared to when they all start staring at you, that is a wonderful idea. 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:15.400
 Project Cybersyn, gentlemen. 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.720
 Robot pigeons, was not it? 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.500
 Robot pigeons with rocket motors in their buttocks. We have already confirmed this, Tom. 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.820
 Chili. 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.740
 The seventies ... At the beginning of the seventies. 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.620
 Was it a public computer project? 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.420
 Ooh! 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.000
 Yes may have a point, but what do you mean by public? 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.300
 A computer in a cafe for someone - for everyone to use. 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.340
 No. Not quite. 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:40.080
 One of the state-sponsored, productivity strives, will ensure that robots come into factories. 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.820
 To make things more efficient 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:47.220
 Yes, you keep doing this ... "Is it a government-sponsored productivity ... robot ... in that" 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.940
 No no. 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.180
 Sponsored by the state. You know what, you get a point from me. Productivity sponsored by the state [ding]. Because, as you know, socialist government back then. 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.020
 What were they trying to do? 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.100
 Getting everyone to count? 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.860
 Want to learn computer knowledge? 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.340
 Yes, but that is too early. That's the seventies. 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.180
 Way too early 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.340
 Then everything was about improving productivity in the workplace ... 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.220
 because that is where all the robot factories ended up and things. 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:12.780
 So it has to do with transport and transport and the movement of goods and so? 

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:14.240
 Yes! Here you have a point [thing] 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.380
 Databases is not it? 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.320
 And you also have a point [thing] 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.600
 It was an attempt to plan the economy of Chile ... 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:23.220
 With the help of one large computer system. 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:26.680
 And now! Since this has only worked for a short period ... 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.560
 Can I assume that it was not a complete success? 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.200
 And everybody burned it? 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:35.160
 No, it did have a bit of success. 

00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.940
 Has it declared people 'No longer essential'? 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:42.260
 No, they got it, to search for errors in the code. 

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:45.200
 The screen flashes 'you are better off with coup'. 

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.740
 I do not know anything about politics here. I do not even know if it is appropriate. 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.260
 "We turned it on and everything the screen says is" Death! " 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.060
 All state factories of the state were given a computer terminal. 

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.060
 where they introduced all details about what happened. 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:04.220
 And that was fed back to ...? 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:05.940
 The office of the president. 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:06.980
 The mainframe. 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.560
 A guy with small glasses and a slide rule. 

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.780
 Matt is closer [thing]. 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:12.420
 America! 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.920
 No, it was a central control room in Chile. 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.960
 Complete with, what? 

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.180
 Coffee machine? 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:20.000
 Toilets? 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.480
 There was a lot ... 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.200
 If this were the seventies, a strike! 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.240
 I'll tell you something; you get a point [thing]. 

00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:29.960
 It helped deal with striking employees. 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.080
 By killing them? 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:32.240
 No. By … 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.900
 No. 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.700
 "Computer, what is our solution?" 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.620
 "There is only 'Death' again." 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:40.260
 "What I also impress!" 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:44.900
 Striking truck drivers blocked access to the capital. 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.340
 But they were able to find the free routes ... 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.740
 and which factories still had employees who could send things out. And they used that central computer for that. 

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:53.260
 Oh, did it have Google Maps? 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.420
 Not really then, right? 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:56.440
 No, Bing! 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:58.640
 Oh my God! 

00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.880
 "Ah, I see you want to visit ... the middle of the Atlantic." 

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.800
 "Here is a picture of France." 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.880
 Thanks Bing! 

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:06.760
 Thanks Bing! 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.600
 Bing would be so much better if it was recorded by Bing Crosby. 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.840
 "So, I see you want to know more about York in England?" 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.280
 "Well, there you go." 

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:20.780
 Except that it is Bing, so you get a map of the New York subway network. 

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.600
 "But, why would you want to go somewhere else?" 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.880
 "Ah, sir, that's all you need to know about York ... uh ... you're not here." 

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.240
 "played well, boys." 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:33.320
 What did the Central Planning Bureau have for the seven people who were sitting around ... 

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:33.940
 Chairs? 

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.020
 Super cool, reclining consoles with lots of screens and ... 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.300
 I give you a point [thing]. They had… 

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:40.860
 These are the seventies, swirling tape and lights, right? 

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.700
 Sure! 

00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:46.500
 Here we go. 1970, Star Trek-style console chairs in science fiction style. 

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:51.200
 for the seven people who collected all this information and made the decisions. 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.520
 A sign on the toilet with 'Captain's Log' on it. 

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:56.440
 Aww ... 

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.300
 What was fine, apart from the guys in the very short dresses. 

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.180
 Oh yeah! 

00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:02.720
 - I'm thinking of Star Trek uniforms here. - Yes. 

00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.200
 The early Next Generation Star Trek had gender neutral uniforms. 

00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.280
 that were basically short dresses, to about ... 

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.500
 I believe they were called 'skants'. 

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:11.560
 Skants. Yes. 

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:14.080
 That sounds like a crisp snack. 

00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:14.900
 Skant! 

00:08:14.900 --> 00:08:16.520
 - Skants! - New Skants! 

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:19.160
 You open the bag; there is not much in it. 

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.220
 Buy them today ... 

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.460
 BECAUSE THE COMPUTER HAPPENS YOU! 

00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:26.720
 Buy them, or the pigeons will come after you! 

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:35.280
 You know, in history there are a number of people with big dreams about socialist planning and computers. 

00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.740
 that have never been fulfilled. 

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:38.740
 The dream of this man did become reality. 

00:08:38.980 --> 00:08:39.720
 William Shatner! 

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.760
 He just wanted a real Enterprise. 

00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:45.500
 From which country did Stafford Beer come from? 

00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:46.560
 America! 

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:47.540
 No. 

00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.880
 The United Kingdom! 

00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:50.160
 Yes that's right! [thing]. 

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:54.160
 A British management cybernetics consultant. 

00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.440
 - Potverdorie! - What? In the seventies ... 

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:59.480
 - In 1970. - You can not be that anymore now, do you? 

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.000
 Stafford Beer. 

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.980
 For that you have to be a startup now. 

00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:06.860
 He also sympathized with the Chilean socialists. 

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:09.120
 And that worked pretty well! 

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.240
 I can imagine that! 

00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.760
 He actually got - I do not know if it was a phone call at the time - but he suddenly got a message. 

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:16.360
 - Probably a telex. - A telex, right? 

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.580
 From the COM-PU-TER! 

00:09:18.580 --> 00:09:22.760
 Of the beautifully named Fernando Flores and he actually left all his other work and said: 

00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:23.960
 "Yes, I'm going to Chile!" 

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.600
 Someone has to pick up the [work] later. Otherwise it is everywhere on the floor! 

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:28.120
 And help the socialists. 

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:29.280
 Did they have a five-year plan? 

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:31.540
 Well, yes, but it took about two years. 

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.400
 I just wanted to say, did not it work well? 

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:36.040
 That is the duration of most five-year plans, in my experience, yes. 

00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:38.080
 Let me guess, they were already pumping him very quickly. 

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.040
 No, they got a military coup. 

00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.580
 Got?! ♫ There is a birthday hurray ... 

00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:44.080
 ♫ Here is a coup ... ♫ 

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:47.560
 ♫ You have five minutes to leave 

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.280
 ♫ And your family too! ♫ 

00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.880
 I mean Chris, you pressed the button, but it was completely right. 

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:01.760
 Those cookies are for Gary. Well done. 

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.220
 Yes, the Chilean coup of 1973. 

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:09.420
 Are not those little things that you have at parties? 

00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:11.540
 That is ... That is ... Crudités (French cut vegetables)! 

00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:13.880
 A coup of crudités! 

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.580
 Oh look, it has the shape of a small gun! 

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:19.240
 How avant-garde! 

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.320
 Ooh! It has taken over my intestines! 

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.360
 Yes, that caviar was somewhat suspicious. 

00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:29.200
 Does the fridge open ... Flags ... Parade ... 

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.520
 Tins of sardines that go around like nuclear missiles. 

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:37.260
 Then, a few years later, people wear red t-shirts with crudités! 

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:42.060
 Large images of a can of sardines ... 

00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.740
 Are being held. They are clearly modified with a spray gun to make them look a bit newer. 

00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:46.540
 Yes! 

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:49.220
 Those with the smoked salmon are at the top ... 

00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.820
 for although all people are born equal, some are more equal than others. 

00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:56.800
 Apart from a very old one in the middle; it looks as if it could fall off at any time. 

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:58.560
 With a great mustache! 

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.660
 It is a Chilean coup, so with a big hat and sunglasses. 

00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:04.160
 Who was behind the Chilean coup? In 1973? 

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.540
 That was the COM-PU-TER! 

00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:06.780
 It must have been the United States. 

00:11:06.780 --> 00:11:09.320
 It must have been the United States. The government of Richard Nixon. Yes. [thing] 

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:11.960
 There is a name that you might recognize, someone who came to power after it. 

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.440
 - Pinochet! - Pinochet! [thing] 

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.340
 Damn! I had it right. Oh yeah. 

00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.880
 It was the coup in which Pinochet came to power. 

00:11:17.880 --> 00:11:19.320
 And ... As you know ... 

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:26.200
 As part of that, the enormous infrastructure of socialism against which Nixon and the US fought. 

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.120
 The enormous computer-organized whole ... Destroyed. 

00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:31.980
 It must be said, in less than ... 

00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:34.120
 Ooh how how! 

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.720
 It was not my intention that that would really hit. 

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:38.360
 -- Hey! - Handbags in the morning, ladies! 

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.920
 He is right, that was really worth mentioning. 

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:44.680
 That's the most 'close that door' slap I've ever seen, Tom. 

00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:46.060
 That is true. 

00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.840
 It is worth mentioning that they had an advanced prototype ready in less than two years. 

00:11:51.840 --> 00:11:56.020
 What kind of central government operation; I do not know if the UK could do that ... 

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:59.560
 with a single project. Late is a big national project. 

00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.480
 So they went completely startup? 

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.580
 Yes. They… 

00:12:02.580 --> 00:12:06.520
 They had a great idea. They had a burn-out after two years. Almost literally. 

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:08.120
 That is it. That's all I'm going to say. 

00:12:08.120 --> 00:12:09.460
 Yes, they succeeded. 

00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:13.480
 And nobody received money at the end. And the person who thought up the idea ... 

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.340
 despite the fact that it was technically a failure, continued with a successful career in other fields. 

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.360
 And now nobody has heard of it! 

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:20.320
 Practically a start-up in the technology industry. See there! 

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:22.480
 The end of the nineties, recorded. 

00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:23.180
 Yes! 

00:12:23.180 --> 00:12:26.300
 So, congratulations. At the end, I think Gary ... 

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:28.080
 you are clearly the winner this time. 

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:35.080
 You win a restaurant that cooks lingerie over a box of hot coals that once belonged to a well-known civil engineer ... 

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.000
 Continue… 

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.440
 It is Brunel's Brassieres and Braziers Brasserie. 

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:44.260
 So congratulations, enjoy it. 

00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:46.980
 And then we say hello to Chris Joel ... 

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:48.260
 Against Gary Brannan ... 

00:12:48.260 --> 00:12:49.040
 And Matt Gray ... 

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:50.520
 This was Tom Scott and we'll see you next time. 

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.540
