00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 I am staring at the sun at the sundial in the Olympic Park, 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.040
 and this is a very nicely designed sundial. 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.440
 Because not only the user is the gnomon - the pole for the sundial - 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.040
 so my shadow reads 11 hours 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.040
 and that is quite accurate. 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.400
 It also has GMT and BST so in the summer months the time is still correct, 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.500
 and time equalization is built in. 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.000
 Well, time equation, the name sounds like pseudo-scientific mess, but it is not. 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:28.340
 It is a comparison in the old-fashioned sense of the word; "make equal". 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.840
 See, there are two kinds of time, so to speak. 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.340
 There is solar time, the time that means it is noon when the sun is at its highest. 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.520
 And there is standard time. Clock time. 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.020
 A kind of average, ideal time 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.700
 where afternoon occurs reliably every 24 hours. 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.980
 And, well, there is a difference between the two. 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.940
 Because when I look at my feet, 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.700
 it's June now, so I'm here. 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.700
 If it were March or September, 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.700
 then I would stand here. 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.760
 That is because the sun would be in a different position in the air, namely lower. 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.200
 Because a) The Earth is turned a bit because of the seasons. 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.200
 b) The Earth is an ellipse, not a circle. 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.920
 So if I were to stand here, the sun would be in a different position, 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.980
 but my shadow would still give 11 hours. 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.980
 And if it is January or December, in the middle of winter, 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.600
 then I would stand here and my shadow would still be- 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.620
 Well, the sun would disappear behind the Olympic Stadium. 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.620
 So my shadow would not be seen anywhere. 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.080
 But if there would be a shadow, 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.080
 then it would still give 11. 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.480
 And the interesting thing about this is that sundials have only been equipped with this in the last few centuries. 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.320
 Because in the past sundials were the 'only real' accurate indication of time. 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.420
 When the sundial said it was noon 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.020
 the sun was in the highest place in the sky and it was noon. 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.020
 It did not matter what season it was. 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 And then the reliable clocks came 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.240
 and later the railways and telecommunications. 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.020
 It became necessary to different parts of the country 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.240
 at the same time, 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.180
 to keep the same 'afternoon'. 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.740
 So it went from sundials that were accurate 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.140
 and mechanical clocks that were always a bit wrong ... 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.460
 to mechanical clocks that became accurate 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.520
 and sundials that were always a bit wrong. 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.580
 And from a few centuries ago you can find things 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.380
 called 'equation clocks'. 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.400
 Perfectly accurate clocks, reliable 24 hours in a day clocks, more or less. 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.380
 Who intentionally adjusted their time, 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.380
 either by means of a complicated clock mechanism, 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.920
 or by the user who adjusted. 

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.620
 So that they were right with the sundials 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.860
 and not the other way around. 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.220
 Because sunrise in the east could be 20 to 25 minutes 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.180
 rather than sunrise in the west of Great Britain. 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.400
 So, time equalization. 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.560
 It is something that means that sundials are no longer accurate, 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.260
 despite that they ever were. 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.700
 Something you might not know. 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.940
