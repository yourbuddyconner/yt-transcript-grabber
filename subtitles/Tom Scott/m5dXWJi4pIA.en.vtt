00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:01.650
 TOM SCOTT: I got an email saying: 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.549
 "Would you like to visit our satellite room?" 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.550
 Yes. Yes I would like. 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.360
 (How does it climb?) 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.230
 WOUTER WEGGELAAR: This is a clean room. 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.050
 We have a working environment here, people can work clean. 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.640
 Basically, it's a box in a box. 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.019
 And there are some filters on the roof 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.179
 and also in the walls we have ventilation 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:26.400
 so the air is always down 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.259
 and also a clean room with laminar flow 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.310
 so the air always moves straight down 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.759
 instead of in the vortices. 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.390
 TS: Innovative Space Logistics in the Netherlands. 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.980
 Originally a separate project from the technical department of TU Delft, 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.960
 now emit minisites like this - 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.949
 well, it's just a model, that's why I can touch it - 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:47.410
 but they send satellites like this into the real universe. 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.379
 Think, rockets can start anywhere in the world, 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.089
 but some satellites on board? Assembled here. 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:57.089
 WW: The cage behind me is the customs zone 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:00.879
 where the satellites get inside a clean room 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.739
 but not in the Netherlands 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.350
 it's for export reasons. 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.000
 We are technically exporting these satellites to the country 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.390
 which is the starting country 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.670
 but they are exported to space 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.409
 and the Universe has no box on the forms! 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.890
 TS: There are international standards for clean rooms. 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.070
 They go from ISO 9, which is just normal air, 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.310
 up to ISO 1. This room is only ISO 7, 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.049
 which does not sound very impressive until you realize it is a logarithmic scale: 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.180
 each level of this standard requires a tenth of the amount of dust and particle. 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.110
 So this room guarantees less than 1% of dust outside. 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.200
 WW: So the main source of pollution - 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.140
 and that's why I'm wearing all this - 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.829
 are particles that are released from our own bodies. 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:48.420
 Dead skin cells, hairs. If you smoke, even exhaled air. 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.490
 Beard, in my case, I have a mask. 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.619
 Cardboard, paper, Velcro - 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.859
 basically things you can capture particles and relax if you do not. 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:00.840
 TS: And it's not just about dust particles that you can see. 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.920
 They are actually quite simple. 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.039
 Clean rooms also need to remove microparticles, 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.420
 things that are smaller than bacteria. 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.050
 You do not have to get all of them, 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.050
 but you have to get most of them. 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.349
 WW: This is a small communications satellite named Nayif-1. 

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.840
 And this satellite will be a communication experiment 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.590
 and will also be used in space teaching classes. 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.590
 Schools can receive signals from this satellite 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.450
 decode them in class 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.140
 and learn about the universe, learning about radio. 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.220
 TS: The worst case scenario here is contamination on the camera lens, 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.090
 or a vacuum gyroscope that fails when it makes 10,000 rpm ... in space. 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.489
 This is the real satellite, 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.940
 will be heading into space later this year, 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.590
 and I have to stand by him, 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.690
 for if I leaned, so dust from me, 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.879
 or saliva from my mouth, can fall down. 

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:51.550
 It will not destroy anything now. 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.510
 but in zero gravity, in vacuum, 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.489
 with direct sunlight shining directly on it? 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.590
 It is not possible to call a satellite fault service. 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.209
 And so to be sure, it is still kept very, very clean. 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.510
 But those ISO 1 clean rooms? They are for many other missions. 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.989
 WW: ISO 1 clean rooms are very clean, 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.250
 and basically for Mars missions or missions to the moon, 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.690
 where we do not want to contaminate the surface of the planet or any other subject we want to reach. 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.900
 TS: Will you send something soon to Mars? 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.909
 WW: Not at the moment, not planned 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.220
 but maybe in the future we'll send something to Mars! You never know. 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.380
