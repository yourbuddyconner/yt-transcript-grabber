00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.850
 For most people, a sponge-shaped cloud means an exploded atomic bomb, 

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.540
 threat of radioactive contamination 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.130
 and surely mutual destruction and end of the world. 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:10.720
 But this is not a must. 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.610
 Any large explosion would create a mushroom cloud. 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.450
 And this has happened in the UK - right here. 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.980
 Instead of this crater, KCF Fold was an old mine, 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.610
 turned into an underground garrison of the Royal Air Force. 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.840
 Keeping ammunition should be safer - 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.600
 One problem with ordinary warehouses is that the enemy 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.949
 you just have to hit them with a bomb and everything explodes. 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:39.699
 This mine seemed perfect, but there was one problem. 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.370
 Since it was built in the 1930s for small bombs, 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.160
 such as can be worn by a person, 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.809
 as they can travel by conveyor belt, 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:51.260
 whatever soldiers can shoot from the gauntlets over the trenches. 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.659
 That's why these old quarries with all their tunnels were perfect. 

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.750
 But during the Second World War 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.710
 bombing becomes work of the Air Force, 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.880
 and bombs are getting bigger and bigger faster - half a ton, one ton, two tons. 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.280
 And for the war, they needed many, many more bombs than they thought from the beginning. 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.719
 Rapid changes in demand and supply led to underground warehouses 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:18.870
 to be filled far beyond their capacity. 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:25.579
 By the end of 1944 here in KSF Fold there were piles of highly incendiary bombs 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:28.939
 outside the mine until they find a place inside. 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.759
 There was a war. 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:32.770
 They had to do what they could. 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.530
 Monday, 27th November 1944. 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.430
 The Chief Officer was on leave. 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.590
 The officer responsible for the underground warehouse was also on leave - 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.259
 and his deputy. 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:50.219
 Every boss in the warehouse was inexperienced and extremely overloaded. 

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:52.229
 According to an official investigation 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.140
 someone tried to remove a detonator from an active brass chisel. 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.789
 And brass chisels cause sparks. 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.439
 In Morocco, 2400 km from here, something like a distant earthquake is detected. 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.840
 160 km from here people heard rumble. 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.020
 At 6 km from here a shock wave broke windows. 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.690
 And here, a sponge-shaped cloud rose in the sky. 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.681
 4,000 tons of bomb exploded in a terrible chain reaction - 

00:02:23.681 --> 00:02:26.670
 Britain's largest explosion in history. 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.840
 In place of this crater there was once a hill with a farmhouse on the top. 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.260
 There is no sign of the house and the people who lived there. 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.400
 The bombs, which did not explode immediately, blew into the air 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.030
 and attacked in a circle of miles along with millions of tons of debris. 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.710
 A nearby dam wall collapsed, flooding factories and houses in the nearby valley. 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.760
 The exact number of victims is not known - at least 60, maybe 90. 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.170
 It took months to find the bodies of the dead and some were never discovered. 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:03.300
 And in the Air Force reports, classified for many years after the explosion, 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:06.160
 along with the names of the victims and page after page 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.150
 detailed descriptions of the damage, this phrase stands: 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.400
 "Columns of black smoke and debris rose in the form of a huge sponge." 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.250
 When hurrying when inexperienced, everyone can feel self-conscious, 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.200
 to do something casual, to make a mistake. 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.980
 Even when working with explosives. 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:33.290
 After many years, the crater is clear; decades later 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.640
 what's left is just a scar in the landscape. 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.730
 About half of the bombs actually survived the explosion 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:47.960
 and, although removed, there are still tunnels and storage facilities under the crater. 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:52.320
 But as travelers have begun to damage the site, 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.200
 all known entrances were filled. 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.220
 And knowing that there are still unexploded bombs in the crater, 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.870
 I will not skip this fence. 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.620
 But there is an interesting detail 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.240
 right at the end of history. 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.400
 In the late 1940s and 1950s, 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.730
 American military monsters for recordings and details of the explosion. 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:15.379
 How big was it exactly? 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.000
 What were the damage to the surrounding earth and whether it was due to the earthquake or the blast wave? 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.220
 What happens if you detonate 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:26.860
 something with the size of an atomic bomb underground? 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:28.980
 Britain did not respond. 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:32.320
 And America returned to making its own mushrooming clouds. 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.620
