00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.340
 If you have a GPS unit - in your car, in your smartphone, whatever - 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:11.340
 It will certainly not work if you go above 60,000 feet or go faster than 1200mph. 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.560
 And the reason 

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.200
 is this 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.240
 This is the Rocket Garden at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.280
 And it is intercontinental ballistic missiles that they have strapped a person to the top 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.100
 and he has them in space. 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.020
 And when GPS was developed by the US Department of Defense, the Cold War was still underway. 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.460
 And - well, but it didn't want Soviet ICBMs to be incredibly targeted. 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.040
 And so the entire GPS chip that has been used by consumers will have this limitation in them - 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.040
 that if you say too fast or too high, 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.040
 "Oh no, I'm a missile!" 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.840
 And stop working. 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.180
 And the only time it really touched anyone in the last few years 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.200
 as a high-altitude unmanned balloon ride pulled out, the kind of stratosphere weather balloons 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.060
 taking beautiful pictures from the height. 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.660
 Because when they come down they need to track down, and the GPS unit suddenly thinks 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.740
 it is in the stratosphere, it must be a missile, and shut it down. 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.500
 And the solution? Some of these GPS units just shut down if you go too high 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.320
 AND too fast. Find one of those, you can use it in your balloon. 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.800
 Otherwise, it's probably best if you stay a little closer to Earth. 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.040
 And this is something you may not have known. 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.980
