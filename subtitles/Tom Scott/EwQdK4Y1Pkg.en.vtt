00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.299
 TOM: I am here with Robert Llewellyn, Scrapheap Challenge and Red Dwarf and many other things. 

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:08.290
 but more importantly: an electronic car fan. What are we in? 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:09.460
 ROBERT: We are in a Tesla Model S. 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:11.810
 TOM: I can not handle fast acceleration. 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.249
 A fuel-driven car, becomes lighter when you burn fuel. 

00:00:17.249 --> 00:00:21.060
 Race cars have to keep an eye on that. Too much fuel and they are too heavy 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.519
 and they slow down. Too little fuel and they will be without fuel on the racetrack. But I recently had the thought: 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:31.199
 Does that also apply to electric cars? Because energy = mass, according to 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.079
 the laws of nature that I have learned. 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:32.599
 ROBERT: Yes. 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.780
 TOM: So while you lose energy, Or it converts to movement .. loss 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.129
 you then mass, do you become lighter? 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:45.559
 I thought I could easily look it up, but that was not the case. The internet has 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.969
 a lot of contradictory opinions from amateur physicists. So I asked professional physicists. 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:53.469
 I asked a handful of physicists, including Professor 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.320
 Philip Moriarty, of Sixty Symbols. And the majority agrees that when 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.969
 the battery is full, she is the heaviest. 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.679
 Godv ----- [Ahh] 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:11.040
 Wow this is fast! we drive tach - we are already driving 96! 112! 128! 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.680
 Ok, electrons are not being removed from the battery at this time. It is slightly more nuanced than that. 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.180
 In ways that I do not understand and that I spend hours or even 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.460
 some years of physics lessons would need to understand it. 192! But we can do exactly 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.590
 calculate the maximum difference with the help of the best-known formula in the world. 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.549
 Energy - 216! Energy is equal to mass times the speed of light squared. The battery 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:40.600
 in this car contains about 85 kilowatt hours, which is about 306 million joules. 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.100
 Divide this by the square of the speed of light, and the result is about 3.4 micrograms 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:52.500
 or about - wow strong deceleration wow! - or about the weight ... 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.619
 Wow my voice was above during braking, I was flattened. 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:01.840
 Or about the weight of a small grain of sand. It is impossible to measure, we lost more mass 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.759
 of the tires during braking. 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:04.119
 ROBERT: [LAUGHING] 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:10.629
 TOM: And if I spit out of the window we would lose a hundred thousand times more weight. 

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.340
 Literally, I've calculated it. 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.010
 What it comes down to: That acceleration, that use of the battery means that we 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.370
 lighter so when we accelerate again ... 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.440
 ... we go a little bit faster. 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.459
 Robert Llewellyn's new book "News from the Clouds" is now on sale. Robert, 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.870
 Thank you so much for being a good test pilot.
