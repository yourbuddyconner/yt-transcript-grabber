00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.840
 Fives 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.460
 Three two one high 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.540
 I am now suffering from 1.8G force. 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.380
 The weight that represents me is about 1.8 times my usual weight. 

00:00:12.381 --> 00:00:15.720
 They want my head to face forward to avoid airsickness 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.540
 But now it’s time to start changing. 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:20.520
 Because I am sitting on the European Space Agency’s zero-g force flight. 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.940
 They are students who are doing research 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.800
 This is Neil, he came to make sure I am safe. 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.660
 We are now ready to fall free 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.917
 This is a very strange thing 

00:00:32.917 --> 00:00:35.534
 We are actually still climbing now. 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.640
 That shot is fixed on the horizontal line 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:42.560
 And our 10th second on the 20 second parabolic route 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.600
 Will fly over the parabolic vertices and start flying towards the ground 

00:00:49.668 --> 00:00:51.585
 I have to come 1.8G 

00:00:53.514 --> 00:00:57.215
 (Novespace pilot) This special aircraft has three axes 

00:00:57.215 --> 00:00:59.849
 Pitch, roll, yaw 

00:00:59.849 --> 00:01:02.898
 One pilot operates an axis 

00:01:02.898 --> 00:01:06.039
 In other aircraft, one pilot operates three axes at a time. 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.940
 The other is responsible for the operating system, using the walkie-talkie, etc. 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.340
 To fly this parabola, you must operate an axis by yourself. 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.036
 We have to avoid any turbulence 

00:01:19.036 --> 00:01:22.713
 Chaos is our nightmare 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.100
 Like other airplanes, the two joysticks are fixed together. 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.760
 (European Space Agency parabolic flight coordinator) to ensure that they move at the same time 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.700
 (European Space Agency parabolic flight coordinator) One of the pilots effectively used 

00:01:31.715 --> 00:01:34.521
 Rubber bands on both sides of the joystick 

00:01:34.521 --> 00:01:38.415
 So that he won’t affect the axis of another driving 

00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:41.285
 Another operation is tilted and the other is operated to roll 

00:01:41.285 --> 00:01:43.597
 Also avoid disturbing the pitch axis 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.700
 The Apollo 15 astronaut made a test on the moon in 1917. 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.400
 Whether all objects fall at the same speed regardless of their weight without air 

00:01:52.427 --> 00:01:55.740
 They used both the scorpion and the feathers to land at the same time. 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.256
 "Look at it!" 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.320
 But the strange thing is that if the astronaut’s nephew is lost 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.495
 From the moment of the hand to the moment of landing 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.120
 The scorpion will remain in a free fall state 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.540
 The only gravity comes from the moon 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.100
 Regardless of whether it is correct relative to our speed or direction, this calculation is correct. 

00:02:13.151 --> 00:02:15.032
 This is what we have just done. 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.660
 It may sound strange, but we confirmed 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.720
 Then now we are ready to test again 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.140
 Parabolic line every five to ten times 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.960
 In order to maintain the most accurate parabola 

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:31.500
 We will change hands, especially the pitch axis, because this is the most technical level. 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.497
 After five to ten times, the pilot will feel tired. 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.620
 Need to switch to a more convenient axis to do the operation 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.600
 Three two one high 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.500
 This parabolic operation is not what the Airbus will do. 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.700
 The software of this aircraft has not been modified for this purpose. 

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.900
 Because the modification process will be very labor intensive 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.692
 So the general software will issue a warning 

00:02:56.692 --> 00:02:59.476
 "You are not a good idea to do this." 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.360
 One of the less busy two-axis pilots 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.760
 Turn off the unimportant warning 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.920
 And pay attention to the real warning 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.360
 The route that the pilots fly is 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.800
 An object is thrown into the air without air and the speed is several hundred kilometers 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.960
 They allow passengers to fly with zero G force in the cabin protection 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.980
 The speed of this aircraft is the limit of the design of the aircraft itself. 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.016
 We have to reach the speed limit now and there are other restrictions. 

00:03:32.016 --> 00:03:34.940
 Because it is so fast as it goes down to the ground 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.680
 The plane will soon approach the surface 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.100
 Thank you Neil 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:42.620
 If you are a master of the European Space Agency 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.900
 Want to be one of the people behind 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.120
 Go and see the Fly Your Thesis project 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.000
 Link to the information below the video 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.980
 Thank you Neil 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.440
 I can, I can be very good. 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:02.040
 Going down
