00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.480
 TOM SCOT: Junior Winter Olympics 

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:05.280
 led me to Lillehammer, Norway, and to that - 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.259
 bobsleigh track Hunderfossen - 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.709
 the second largest cooling plant in Norway. 

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.660
 I know when you hear "Norway" and "cooling installation" 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.940
 you probably think of the Arctic, 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.140
 which is actually greater than this system, 

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.770
 but this route is really like a huge freezer. 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.240
 Here the ice does not melt at an air temperature of up to 20 Â° C, 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:30.930
 so competitors can accelerate 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.070
 up to 4 g at the last turn, 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.860
 even when there should be no ice on which to slide. 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.720
 JAN ODDVAR Tangen: We can keep the ice 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.560
 in the summer - normal Norwegian summer! 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.750
 It is built of concrete. 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.800
 There are many layers of pipes in the concrete. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.470
 Ammonia flows into the tubes. 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.070
 TS: When the liquid evaporates, it takes heat from the environment in which it is located. 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.270
 90 tonnes of ammonia are circulating in the tubes below the track, 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.350
 as it is repeatedly compressed 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.299
 and then evaporated, 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.590
 to extract the heat. Ammonia, by the way, 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.710
 is very dangerous if it is not used properly. 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:21.159
 JOT: Ammonia is the liquid that quickly consumes heat. 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.680
 All ammonia flows through 65 km long pipes 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.820
 and always stays in them. 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.460
 If anything happens, I can turn off the system 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.640
 where the ammonia flows out. 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.820
 It is lighter than the air, so it rises upwards 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.950
 and no one can hurt! 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.659
 TS: But the laws of thermodynamics always work. 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:46.820
 Can not create cold. You can only move heat. 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.299
 And in this process you get more heat. 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:52.100
 That's why the back of your fridge is warm 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.520
 and why air conditioners need to cool outside. 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.970
 And with this large installation, it takes a lot of heat to move. 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.100
 JOT: First we clean the track 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.320
 with ordinary water hoses. 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.580
 In the first week of the season, 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.870
 and after a dozen days - skeleton slides, 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.800
 because then the ice is thick enough 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.060
 to deal with bobsleigh and skeleton sleighs. 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.849
 TS: Tours are measured to hundredths of a second, 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.150
 this is important 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.050
 to keep the ice well frozen, 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.599
 to be honest for all. 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.550
 A little more or less friction can affect the result. 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.450
 And when precision in measurement is so valued, it turns out, 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.080
 having such a large freezer is quite important. 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.650
 There are still many videos on the Olympics channel, 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.830
 as well as on my channel - watch them and subscribe. 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.930
 Thanks to the Youth Olympic Games 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:51.650
 that they led me to Lillehammer. 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.900
