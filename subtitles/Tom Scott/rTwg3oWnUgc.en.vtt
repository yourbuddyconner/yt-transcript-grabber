00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.339
 European law protects you from automatic decisions. Which sounds like a minor thing, but if one 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.389
 automatic system makes meaningful decisions about your life - whether you get a pay rise, 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.450
 or if you get an official warning to get stuck at work - then you should be told that 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.210
 was an automatic decision and you must have the opportunity to get it judged by a human being. At least 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.850
 in Europe. And importantly, you should be able to tell a company never to make automatic decisions 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.940
 about you and they must adhere to it. It is not necessary to be observed by small things like 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.190
 online personality quizzes unless that quiz decides - without a person in the loop - about 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.710
 You are a safe person to borrow money for. 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.579
 But it is all fairly clear automatic systems, even if it may not feel that way 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.649
 when you have just been denied a loan. 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:49.170
 But what about automatic systems that are supposed to be harmful to humans? 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.940
 I've filmed this tank before. It's an old Soviet T-34 combat tank, set in here 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.760
 London two decades ago by a sour local resident who refused permission to build on this 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.190
 piece of land ... but had permission to keep vehicles here. Or he also got permission 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.110
 to put a 'tank' here because the local council thought he was talking about some kind of 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.170
 storage tank, not a real T-34. The stories have become a little confused over the last twenty years. 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.080
 But this tank is designed for people. It is designed for human soldiers taking human decisions. 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.870
 And that concept may not be much longer. 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:29.490
 You see, the US Army has just released a report called 'Visualization of the Tactical Battlefield on Earth 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:34.460
 in the year 2050 '. Which sounds like a pretty boring cartoon, but it's actually 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.660
 a nice reading experience; And they have some good things to say about automatic decision making. 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.020
 The US Army believes that not all people have the ability to handle all the information that is going on 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.400
 cast against them in the heat of battle in the future. Computer processing power, they say, will not 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.730
 be a limiting factor and as people turn to automatic decision making, 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.520
 We will of course be fine with using it, also on the battlefield. If you have a soldier that's fine with 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.500
 Of course, to let the autopilot control their car, they will also be fine with doing exactly that 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.600
 same on their tank and their weapons. 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.069
 "Fight rhythms," - and I quote the report directly here, 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.409
 "combat rhythms will increase to the point where, in many cases, no people want anymore 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:19.329
 could be 'in the loop', but instead had to operate 'in the loop', where 'people 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:24.959
 can only observe the behaviors that take place '... and' act according to the fact or with a back thought 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:26.879
 in expected behavior. " 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:32.799
 So to be clear: the US Army believes in the coming decades that they want 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:38.019
 uncontrolled weapons that will have behavior patterns that an engineer will come to 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.680
 trying to 'debug' while firing ammunition. If you are a programmer working 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.219
 But 'open-source' computer vision, or coalition avoidance, or, let's say, something like that 

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:53.810
 herd behavior algorithms, then there is a chance that your code will end up as part of it. 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.519
 And if you have moral objections: well, good for you, but it probably won't stop anyone. 

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:05.700
 And I suspect all the laws that Europe can muster will not make big when you have 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.680
 One of these, quite literally, calls the shots. 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.680
