00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
 The mixer battery, ingenious invention, and yet something that seems to have gone past England. 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
 You want Americans coming over and asking why our taps look like something from the 1940s. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 And even here, in my parents' bathroom, I visit my parents this weekend and they 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 just got a new bathroom, there are separate hot and cold taps. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.560
 And there are all sorts of theories as to why it is, they typically turn around 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.560
 "We're Brits", "Stiff Tops" and "We Don't Need Mixing Batteries. We've never had them". 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.000
 And it is partly true, but it is also about how houses in England were built after World War II. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.480
 In most old English houses there is a cold water tank in the attic. It is reasonably large, about 250 liters, 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:46.560
 and it fills up a hot water tank used for central heating, 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.340
 and for hot water in the bathroom, in the kitchen and so on. 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.500
 But the problem is that it may not be quite healthy drinking water. For the cold water container maybe, 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.700
 in some houses that have not been maintained, may have been exposed to the elements, or sand to, or covered 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.980
 in iron dust, or, in a specific case you can read about, have some dead rats floating around in it. 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.000
 That water may not be technically drinkable. And according to the rules, I checked the rules, 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
 It is not considered for drinking water. It cold in return, at least in the kitchen, and sometimes 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
 in the bathroom too, the cold water comes directly from the waterworks. It is termed as drinkable. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
 So here it comes: You have cold, sure, the rules call it "healthy", drinking water, and you have 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 almost certainly safe but not technically, drinkable, hot water. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 And the two should never be mixed. If you have a mixer battery, it can warm water at worst 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.500
 cases when there is a backflow valve fault and the waterworks turn off, return 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.000
 through all the systems, and pollute the rest of the street or the rest of it 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:04.000
 water system. It is illegal and therefore there is no mixer battery. You do not mix the currents. Nowadays, 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
 It is a little different. This house got its hot water tank removed a few months ago. The ceiling is now just a big one 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
 empty room again. And there is some very modern, shiny piece of technology underneath that warms up the water 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 as required. All new houses are being built like this. If they have mixed batteries, that's fine, but ... 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:29.980
 I remember as a kid knowing "never drink from the hot tap". And it got stuck. Even now, if there is a mixer battery 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
 And I want to drink from it, I let the water run for a few seconds just to make sure something potentially uncertain 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
 have come out. Even now, old habits are hard to discard. And sometimes these things just feel a little safer.
