00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.580
 This is a city called Staufen, located in the Black Forest near southwestern Germany. 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.680
 When you go around, he looks like an ordinary German town. 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.780
 But a little weird 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.580
 On some buildings, there is a fake tape trace 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.120
 The slogan "Staufen must not break down!" 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:18.780
 Unfortunately, it’s a bit too late. 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.300
 Local government tries to drill geothermal energy 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.420
 Behind the town hall, they drilled seven holes 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.060
 On the ground floor of Staufen, there is a thick layer of anhydrite 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.460
 Under that, it is a layer of aquifer rich in groundwater. 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.860
 Pressurized groundwater seeps into the anhydrite layer 

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:38.629
 Causes the formation of gypsum and expands by 50% 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:41.660
 Unfortunately, this means that the surface will be raised with bulges. 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.720
 Lead to the cracks in every household 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.460
 The first crack took two weeks to emerge 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.059
 From excavation to the present decades 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.707
 The town hall has been raised nearly half a meter 

00:00:52.707 --> 00:00:55.838
 The sidewalk is also a similar number... 

00:00:55.838 --> 00:00:58.367
 It may not sound much, but if everything 

00:00:58.367 --> 00:01:01.116
 The average bulge, that may not be a problem 

00:01:01.116 --> 00:01:03.129
 But the problem is that every structure of the house 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.848
 The amount of movement is different 

00:01:05.848 --> 00:01:07.532
 Modern architecture cannot overcome this situation 

00:01:07.532 --> 00:01:11.038
 City Hall was built in 1546 

00:01:11.038 --> 00:01:13.360
 The result is... cracking 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.420
 Water oozing from the aquifer, rising from the borehole 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.600
 What they want to do is to exclude the water. 

00:01:19.618 --> 00:01:22.589
 Let the pressure of the aquifer fall 

00:01:22.589 --> 00:01:25.348
 Let them no longer seep out from the hole 

00:01:25.348 --> 00:01:28.977
 They pumped water at about every liter per second. 

00:01:28.977 --> 00:01:31.267
 The expansion speed starts at about one centimeter per month. 

00:01:31.267 --> 00:01:34.160
 It’s already one millimeter per month. 

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.000
 But still in expansion, even a millimeter is too much for every house. 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.140
 In theory, they can terminate this situation. 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.057
 You can't just plug the water like a bathtub, it's okay. 

00:01:44.057 --> 00:01:45.639
 This is not a plane 

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.599
 But three-dimensional 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.700
 You will need a very big plug, but you don't know where he is. 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.580
 The drilling company compromised in court and compensated for one million euros 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.080
 But the damage he caused was at least 50 times that of him. 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.840
 At least eight other German towns have similar problems. 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.739
 Geothermal drilling is very popular, but not so regulated 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.960
 When industry and country learn from mistakes 

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.180
 It’s too late for these towns. 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.216
 Thank you, Constantijn Crijnen (personal name) 

00:02:15.216 --> 00:02:16.898
 At the beginning, he recommended this short film. 

00:02:16.898 --> 00:02:18.910
 He personally also has a 3D print related 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.760
 Youtube videos, if you are interested, let's go.
