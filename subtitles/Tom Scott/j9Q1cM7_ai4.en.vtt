00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:07.110
From 1972 to 1975, the Australian government
informally had a Ministry of Helth. H-E-L-T-H.

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.549
Why? Spelling reform.

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.630
Every so often, someone has a brilliant idea
to reform English spelling. There's an old

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.340
joke from an unknown reformer about how fish
can be spelled ghoti and still be consistent

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.130
with English. Obviously, it can't, because
any fluent English speaker would pronounce

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.740
it ghoti, but that doesn't help anyone learning
the language.

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.980
And you're probably thinking that I'm about
to go off on a rant about how spelling reform

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.390
never works, and that prescriptivists are
doomed to failure. The trouble is... sometimes,

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.430
just sometimes, it does work.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.810
Spelling in English used to be a mess. Well,
it still is a mess, but it was a mess that

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.239
no-one could agree on Shakespeare signed his
name several different ways, and we just happened

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.100
to settle on the current one in the last century.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.920
In 1920, Andrew Carnegie's Simplified Spelling
Board -- an organisation with a surprising

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.149
amount of money behind it -- released the
Handbook of Simplified Spelling. It's been

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.559
scanned and is available online, and it's
worth having a quick look through. It's written

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.110
in simplified spelling, which does tend to
get a bit confusing. But it does make a really

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.830
good point. If we were designing a language
from the ground up -- and heaven knows, people

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.790
have tried -- you would design it with a simple
method of spelling. There *are* natural languages

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.710
out there which are more or less consistent.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.979
While most of the Spelling Board's suggestions
withered on the vine, some did survive. They're

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.290
the reason that American English spells mould
without a U. Indeed, a lot of American versus

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.760
British differences are the remnants of attempted
spelling reforms throughout the years. Color

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.100
and center are spelled differently in the
US because Mr. Noah Webster just decided they

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.350
should be... and he was writing the dictionary.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.580
There's even the more extreme suggestion of
throwing out the current alphabet altogether:

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.259
playwright George Bernard Shaw invented a
new alphabet, which was eventually refined

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.670
into something called Quikscript. It's actually
a rather elegant alphabet, but... well, good

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.229
luck converting people to that. When we're
trained since birth to understand one set

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.619
of squiggles, and reinforce that training
constantly, it's strangely difficult to shift

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.170
to another set of squiggles.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.730
What we do tend to see is the slow adoption
of new spellings. Miniscule, with two Is,

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.870
used to be an incorrect spelling. Now it's
a "variant". To-day used to be hyphenated,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:25.450
as did wire-less and e-mail. And the Associated
Press Style Guide only switched from Web site

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.500
to website in 2010.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.370
But just imposing spelling reform from on
high doesn't generally work. Particularly

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.840
not now, and particularly given how many accents
of English there are. Would you say resistance

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:42.090
is futile, with an E? Or futil, without? In
regular speech, a lot of Americans would say

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:47.400
fudil - voicing the T to turn it into a D.
How do you spell that? And more to the point:

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.180
how do you get everyone to agree to it? For
crying out loud, America can't even shift

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.180
to the metric system, and Britain still...
has a monarchy. That got away from me.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.120
So next time that someone says they don't
know whether judgment has an E in the middle

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.800
of it? Tell them it doesn't matter. Because
in those cases? It really doesn't.

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.610
Next time: a language reform that's steadily
creeping in without anyone really trying.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.920
