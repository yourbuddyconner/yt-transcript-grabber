00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.780
 A few days ago I made a video 

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:04.040
 about how to throw a bucket of water on someone. 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.680
 As for the video, I received several complaints, 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.340
 especially about the scene at the end where I fall into the pool. 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.780
 Some people complained that my acting was horrible. 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:10.640
 Yes, he was. 

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:14.420
 A few people complained that the thrust was probably uploaded and scheduled. 

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.460
 Yes, it was because anyone who would put someone in the pool without their permission is a total stupid 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.060
 and I would not want to talk to him, 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.820
 but no one noticed the really obvious reason why it was fake. 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.520
 I do not mean the underwater shot that could not see any other camera in the field of view. 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:34.480
 No, the reason is that if you try to push someone into the pool, it does not look like that. 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.280
 Put someone in the pool, 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.780
 he will of course not want to go inside: 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.180
 first priority, not to fall into the pool, 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.280
 the second priority, keep your head above the water. 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.340
 So most of the time half-catching, 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.480
 and then returns dry from here upwards. 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.200
 But if you put someone in the pool in a movie or on television, 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.120
 it will look like this. 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.240
 Go on, Hadley! 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.020
 The difference is-- 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:04.420
 says when he takes a new camera-- 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.820
 I fell back first, 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.620
 as low as possible, 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.720
 so much under water, how much I can handle, 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.820
 and then: You see I'm trying to be as long as I can - 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.620
 I swing my hands on the opposite side, 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.240
 because it looks more impressive when I'm underwater for a few seconds longer. 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.740
 Anyone who understands, 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.260
 who deliberately lets go into the water, 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.640
 would not remain underwater, he would not have been under water, 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.600
 maybe she would have even dry hair. 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.840
 But when you do this on TV, 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.780
 you have to convince the viewer that there is a big splash, 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.280
 that there is a big bang that sends the man underwater. 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:47.320
 In fact, as always, it is not at all impressive. 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.940
 And that's something you might not know. 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.620
 Now you will see more shots of falling into the water. 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.720
 If you try it, be careful that there is enough space 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.120
 between the person you throw into the pool and the pool. 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.520
 What if you wait for the signal next time? 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.740
 I'm sorry! 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.060
 [Translation: Cvolton, AK] 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.960
 Towel? 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:39.240
 Yes please.
