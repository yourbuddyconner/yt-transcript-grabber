00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:07.180
 If there is a channel I prefer, I love it more than BuzzFeed. 

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.900
 BuzzFeed is a little closer 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:13.000
 I found the only thing better than Buzzfeed here. 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.740
 BBC Three (BBC Three) 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.740
 Let us pause online games 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.100
 Hey guys, let’s see some people with a lot of experience. 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.000
 This is very popular, right, we can do it. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.619
 No~ 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:28.029
 No~ 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.000
 No~ if you are not familiar with the third BBC 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 He has a very popular series called "What should I say?" 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.849
 Basically, don’t say anything to people with disabilities. 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:39.800
 I think this is a good idea. 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.800
 Because you generally want to respect these people 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.190
 Like many times 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.820
 I am like I am not sure, I don’t know how to tell you. 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.800
 I once met a boy of similar age. 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.000
 He turned to me and said to me 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.500
 What's wrong with your face? 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.500
 I stared at him and then I said: 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 I get a horrible disease 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.000
 If I exhale you, you will also get 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Then I will call ~~~~~~ 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.320
 He screamed and fled 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.800
 So he started with this 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.800
 You know this is a good thing. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
 At some point they follow their route 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
 Then there is no idea. 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.100
 BBC third, if you are watching 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.939
 I can agree that I understand your feelings. 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.400
 Finally finally 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.300
 A movie that is a game lover every time I hear something I don’t want to hear again. 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.200
 When a game lover is so difficult 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.100
 If others don't understand the feeling, maybe you and I also understand it. Let's take a look. 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.200
 Come see it today. 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.200
 You play electric but you don't play proper 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.200
 Because you are a woman 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.920
 The woman won't hit the electric, which is the green onion, I bet you play... 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.060
 I bet you play "simulation citizen", I love you, right? Right? 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.320
 WOWOWOWOW 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.200
 I don't understand these girls who play electric. 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.200
 They want to prove that they are famous video game players. 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.100
 But in fact nobody cares 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.200
 Nobody cares, okay? 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.200
 (XD says good respect for girls) 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.560
 So old and still electric? 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.200
 This is what I always hear. 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.500
 Bu Lin grandmother played very well 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.200
 Girls are not good at games. 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:14.040
 This has been scientifically proven because they have a woman's brain and are not as good as a male brain. 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.000
 I am joking, I am joking... 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:16.709
 I am just kidding... 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.000
 (but this is a scientific fact) 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.100
 You can say it again. 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.500
 Just like a TV show is a movie for children to watch for children. 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.080
 In other words, books and movies are for the sake of entertainment. 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.000
 Awkward entertainment 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.680
 Oh 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.320
 I made a 4Chan stalk map in real life. What happened to my dude (dawg afro-destination) 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:34.400
 The game is for professional 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.000
 The game is for people like me who are jealous. 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.000
 I am super-super..... Why do I always do this? 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.880
 Super waste of money 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.000
喔 casually 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.987
 Have you ever heard of piracy? (XD) 

00:02:47.987 --> 00:02:51.500
 Hey, listen, you can't steal what you are copying. 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.900
 I like her answer, so why? 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.900
 (Pewds OS: Lin Beijin has money) 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.600
 That's not true. This is a more effective way to spend money. 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.589
 No, I can agree 100% because I must be 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.530
 Finish all these games I... 

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.200
 (push you into the Steam pit) 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.480
 I...play them from start to finish 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.000
 In these games and titles, I really get the value of the money I spend. 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.200
 Because I spent time playing them one by one. 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.800
 This is really really expensive. 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.500
 If you put in music you will spend too much money on the megaphone 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.200
 Loudspeaker guitar or drum similar things 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.700
 It’s like everyone has a favorite thing. 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.549
 If you are an electric player you must buy a computer 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:30.809
 What is the argument of a keyboard like yours? I don't understand (dry XD) 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.000
 Video games promote violence 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.900
 This statement is actually right like oh... 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.100
 The game leads to gender discrimination (just you XD) 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.000
 This has been proven many times. 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.220
 Can we continue this argument? 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.370
 One of the most annoying things 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.900
 They are annoyed 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.170
 See how angry they are, look at you and see how angry they are when they hear those words. 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.780
 This is because they are very violent (irony) 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.341
 See how violent this is (continuous irony in XD) 

00:04:04.341 --> 00:04:08.400
 It’s coming at once... But you know that I won’t murder innocent people when I haven’t played the game. 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.930
 If you are a violent person, you are a violent person. 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:12.500
 The game won't make you more violent 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.100
 Will your boyfriend let you enter the game? 

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.759
 Although I just saw you, but I know it will provoke 

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:16.340
 Okay, okay? 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.700
 Will your boyfriend let you in the game? 

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:19.690
 I think the answer is yes (Pewds is a good boyfriend, of course) 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.014
 Why can't girls enter the game by themselves? 

00:04:25.014 --> 00:04:25.629
 No, it’s not good. 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.300
 I am joking, this is a joke. 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.000
 This shows that I don't understand why they are getting angry. 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.700
 That's why it's so funny to me, I'm provoking, that's a joke. 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.700
 Calm but Jesus Christ, I don't understand 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.869
 It’s like stopping care and then no one is birding you, you are blogging in the kitchen. 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.000
 Oh, you must be very wasteful. 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
 Because she is a woman woman playing video games is poor 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.000
 I play Candy Crush but I am not a video game player. 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
 That's not true, it's a lie. 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.730
 Contradictory 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.000
 Why can this provoke people? Are you serious? 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.500
 You are 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.000
 It’s like I said that I already have a dream. 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.500
 Also said that I am not a player relying on you. 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.500
 If you can't accept that you are a video gamer 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.300
 Sir, are you having something? 

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:12.500
 I think I have a problem, yes, I have something. 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.000
 (pewds are very good XD) 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.720
 I don't know why you think I have a problem? 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.669
 I don't understand why you have to define yourself through the fact that you play video games for me. 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.400
 It’s too pitiful for me to be fucking. 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.000
 If you watch a movie, you won’t emphasize that you are a movie viewer. 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000
 Linbei finished watching 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.220
 Yeah, I am a viewer. 

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:35.890
 Am catching? I love movies. Have you finished watching a micro movie? You are a movie viewer. 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:39.760
 Do you watch YouTube? You are a movie attendant, what the hell is it for you (I don't know XD) 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.000
 Can't you just just play Candy Crush? 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000
 And don't have to stress that you are a fucking player? 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000
 When I define myself as a fucking video gamer 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
 Can't I play Candy Crush in my spare time? 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:55.258
 What is the best video game? 

00:05:55.899 --> 00:05:57.819
 That problem is really (very brainy XD) 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:05:58.899
 (hand shake LOL) 

00:05:58.899 --> 00:06:00.899
 I hate people asking me this question. 

00:06:01.119 --> 00:06:02.229
 Do not 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:05.248
 This is almost the same as when someone asks me what is happening on your face. 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.800
 (Your face has always been very XD) 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.800
 How dare they ask!!! 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.000
 Look at the smile on his face 

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:10.000
 Isn’t video game the best thing? Video game = life, everything 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000
 He is talking about high quality and high quality content every day (also telling himself) 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.069
 Continue to everyone 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:18.718
 Being a woman on the Internet is very competitive and difficult here. 

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:19.800
 Living here is very difficult 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:23.500
 You know that I am trying to walk in front of respecting women. 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:27.000
 I am part of the plan to respect women’s ambassadors. 

00:06:27.249 --> 00:06:29.949
 Respectingwomen.org/respect 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.419
 (I really have this website interested, please search for it yourself) 

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.700
 People don't understand what it is. 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:35.800
 So thank God for having BBC 3 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.000
 Because now we have to learn 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:40.000
 What is the concept of being a woman on the Internet? 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:42.088
 (Chavyism genes are in the middle of the game) 

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:46.000
 If you are a woman, you will know something online. 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000
 Facebook friend invitation 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.000
 Often inexplicably received a push invitation and then I just took a look and then turned it off. 

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.529
 That never happened to me. 

00:06:53.529 --> 00:06:58.558
 I have never received a random Facebook friend invitation if you are watching and you are also a male 

00:06:58.559 --> 00:07:05.099
 I am sure you can agree that random dating requests will not happen to our men. 

00:07:05.099 --> 00:07:08.908
 We are very honored to be lucky to be here. 

00:07:09.969 --> 00:07:15.118
 I won't receive a friend from someone you don't know. You may think that I will add you to a friend. 

00:07:15.119 --> 00:07:18.929
 That's why you get it. I have received a bunch of invitations before. Yes, I still have many invitations until now. 

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.139
 This is because I am half a woman damn 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:23.499
 Photo 

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:27.778
 Woman will receive a photo? Who is taking a photo? Why take a photo? (???) 

00:07:27.779 --> 00:07:30.569
 I don't know how to take a photo is three small 

00:07:30.569 --> 00:07:33.000
 Just like I won't expand my ass and take a photo of the asshole 

00:07:34.809 --> 00:07:37.529
 Right, even if it is a beautiful anus, it is absolutely beautiful. 

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:42.268
 Absolutely impeccable perfect symmetry, but I still won’t shoot and send it to someone 

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000
 You look at me very worried because I actually like it. 

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.959
 These girls like to take photos? 

00:07:46.959 --> 00:07:50.000
 Did I miss something? I saw a girl who seemed to like it. 

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.000
 Marzia~~~(XD, I really laughed) 

00:07:51.339 --> 00:07:54.500
 I haven't seen it, but you know what I want is to come tonight. 

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.400
 a second child 

00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:58.300
 I really want a photo of someone Bob. 

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:02.579
 Does this make me like a foundation? Isn’t it possible to have a little bit of fucking? 

00:08:03.249 --> 00:08:05.249
 I don't know if I am in the public. 

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:06.000
 When queuing for coffee 

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.000
 Then you are suddenly bombarded by the penis monsters on your phone. 

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.100
 You don't want to see 

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:14.100
 ("Hao" is aptly described as thanking this lady XD) 

00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:16.000
 He just said three small XDs. 

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000
 "Phallace Monster" 

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.000
 I hate just queuing for coffee, and then you are stunned. 

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.849
 They will still look disdainful when they say something to a connoisseur. 

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:31.500
 But if I don't get a photo, I will want to come to you with amazing and necessary sex. 

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000
 Her mobile phone has become a second child? I don't understand 

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.200
 I don't want the second child to send another photo. 

00:08:37.779 --> 00:08:40.000
 Finally the woman understands 

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:41.889
 Approx 

00:08:41.889 --> 00:08:47.999
 There are a lot of applications that I think deliberately designed to make a classification with a woman's skin color. 

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.900
 For boys: This is my perfect opportunity, like to conquer the black woman, I am not a dream. 

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.000
 Are you mad? Serious? 

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.559
 I swear she is a slinger (Hitmonlee) 

00:08:58.559 --> 00:08:59.500
 I am confused 

00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:03.400
 The dating program is like someone walking on the street and someone tells you: Hey baby but I didn't see anything. 

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.199
 The boys will say: Get out of your throat 

00:09:05.199 --> 00:09:09.000
 Boys who should be fair should have self-esteem for being rejected. 

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:12.500
 I can understand this, don’t be so fucking, so poor. 

00:09:12.639 --> 00:09:18.688
 If the boys on the Internet are not interested in you, it means that you are ugly. 

00:09:18.688 --> 00:09:19.750
 Targeted advertising 

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:20.700
 Targeted advertising 

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:23.700
 I don't know where to start, I agree, my god, I feel... 

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.200
 It’s like... 

00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.000
 If I see targeted advertising and it is for me, I will be very bad. 

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:33.800
 If I receive the latest video game ad I will be like a fucking 

00:09:33.939 --> 00:09:38.519
 Lin Beizhen swears because I am a man, I love games. 

00:09:38.879 --> 00:09:43.000
 For example, receiving an advertisement that reduces your belly fat 

00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:47.000
 That's because you are very fat (Pewds is bad) 

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.660
 Doodle toot doodle~~~ 

00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.990
 You are fat, fat, fertiliser, fertilizer, fertilizer 

00:09:52.990 --> 00:09:57.200
 I am sorry that you are not ashamed. I forgot this. Maybe it is because you are very fat. 

00:09:57.200 --> 00:10:00.000
 Seeing that the BBC is paying taxes 

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:01.170
 Channel 

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:03.170
 The BBC is managed by the British government 

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.170
 If you have a TV license 

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:07.170
 You are obligated to pay 

00:10:07.769 --> 00:10:13.619
 I don't have a TV license. When I moved to the UK, I didn't sign it, so they kept sending me like... 

00:10:13.620 --> 00:10:14.829
 Are you sure? 

00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:17.800
 Do you really want to apply for the BBC? 

00:10:18.178 --> 00:10:18.899
 Don't fucking me 

00:10:18.899 --> 00:10:23.068
 No, no, I won’t support the fairness of this junk. Some videos I think are 

00:10:23.069 --> 00:10:25.529
 Very good ones are cancers that are uncompromising 

00:10:25.529 --> 00:10:31.378
 But I almost summed up the content of the BuzzFeed type of my content for this 

00:10:31.779 --> 00:10:37.078
 PewDiePie knows to respect women and leave a compliment to everyone who respects women. 

00:10:37.079 --> 00:10:43.198
 I am sure there will be some compilations in the future about respecting women's stalks at some point but before that... 

00:10:43.959 --> 00:10:45.959
 Keep awesome
