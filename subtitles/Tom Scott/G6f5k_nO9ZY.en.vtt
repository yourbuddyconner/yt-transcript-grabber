00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:03.360
 This is Technical Difficulties, we play Citation Needed. 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.260
 Today's participants: he reads books, you know, it's Chris Joel! 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.640
 But, quiet! What light is breaking through the late Matthew? 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.320
 Everyone's favorite ... that is not light, that breaks through him (!) 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.220
 Everyone's favorite Gary Brannan, Gary Brannan. 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.100
 Can I compare you to a summer day? 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.100
 No. 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.000
 And the most jumpy man on the internet, Matt Gray. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.940
 Hey hej YouTube! 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.660
 Here in front of me I have an article from Wikipedia, and the rest can not see that. 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.080
 For every good fact they get a point and a thing [DING]. 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.020
 And the special price for particularly good answers, namely ... 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.140
 That is not my buzzer. That's my glass. 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.340
 That really hurt! 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.160
 - Please, Tom. --Thanks. 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.460
 That could only have been better if you had picked up the buzzer to drink from it. 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.760
 and it went "PARP"! 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.000
 Aroogah! Cookies for everyone. 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.680
 For every good fact they get a point and a thing [DING]. 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.320
 And there is a special price for particularly good answers, namely ... 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.320
 And today we are talking about the Shanghai Fugu agreement. 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.280
 No, no, fugu. 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:52.260
 Fugu. 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.980
 Please. Let the cookies come. 

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.780
 Regulations for preparing poisonous fish? 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.660
 Ooh! I will give you a point for poisonous fish, yes [DING]. 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.820
 Absolutely. Tell me about fugu. 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.540
 I saw it on the Simpsons. 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.900
 The point is, so many people were watching and thought 'Fugu! ... Simpsons. " 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.560
 "I do not care about friend, Fugu me!" All that stuff. 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.320
 "Poison, poison, tasty fish." 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.320
 Yes, that's it. 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.960
 It is a poisonous fish that really needs to be carefully prepared. 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.500
 How many years of training do they need for that? 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.420
 A lot of? 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:27.560
 A few? 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.160
 Until they get it done? 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.000
 Gary gets the point. Three. 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.760
 [THING] 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.840
 "First, catch a puffer." 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.520
 [SHICK] 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.640
 "This went wrong." 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.280
 You did 'argh'! 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.640
 Aww ... 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.960
 What does fugue poison do when it goes wrong? 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.840
 It is paralyzing, is not it? 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.080
 --Neurotoxin - Yes 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.460
 Yes, take a point [DING]. By the way, both do only [DING]. It is a tetrodotoxin. 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.520
 - Ooh! - Ooh! 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.520
 At the tip of my tongue, dear boy. 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.400
 Does the tetras poison? 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.680
 It has three. 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.560
 Five? 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.680
 It is what is known as a sodium channel blocker. 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:59.700
 Of course(!) 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.280
 Paralyzes the muscles, while the victim remains conscious. 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:04.380
 What is the antidote? 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.520
 There is no! 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.500
 Point! [THING] 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.700
 True, that does not exist. 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.920
 Ah, I thought it would be fries. 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.840
 That will be really useful, because fugu and fries ... no, it is not like nettles and plantain. 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.200
 Pea pasta? 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.320
 Pea pasties? 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:19.080
 - Would not it be great if it were something like ... - Just eat, everything will be fine. 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.660
 Would not it be great if it were something that they have not come across in Japanese cuisine yet? 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.120
 So that's an excellent antidote for puffer fish ... 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.420
 parkin is. 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.020
 Or something. 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.200
 Mucky fat and bread. 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.160
 Anyone who does not come from Yorkshire Googlet now to 'mucky fat'. 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.700
 Aww beautiful ... 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.880
 And they probably find a few things they did not want to know. 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.380
 Yeah. 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.120
 Mucky fat on toast. 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.600
 Mucky ... Toast? 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.900
 Ours just goes on bread. 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.660
 Little salt and some onion. 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.960
 Normally salty enough. 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.900
 Well, I know. A relative of mine, which I will not name by name, 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.560
 because it is a relative of mine. 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.900
 But maybe not from the environment. Let's just stick to that. 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.700
 Was at a Yorkshire Day party, where we all were. 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.280
 Yorkshire Day, the first of August, reminder of the Battle of Minden. For the viewers at home. 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.640
 I know that is not in Yorkshire, but **** you, that's why. 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:12.680
 We have it again. 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.680
 Erm ... We were at a Yorkshire Day party. Mucky fat on bread did the round. 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.240
 At that point, the person announced "Oh! Pate. ' 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:22.660
 Ah! No no. 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.560
 After which we all nodded slowly and laughed, 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.140
 While the person worked three cuts inside. And then we told them what mucky fat was. It is beef fat. 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.340
 For those of you who do not know what beef fat is, that is just fat that has fallen off the beef. 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.460
 With bits of beef in it. 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:41.880
 It's the stuff that's melted off while they cooked it or something ... 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.920
 It is "residue". 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.080
 It is a residue. 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.920
 Salt residue. 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.380
 Delicious residue. 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:51.940
 It is brown ... or mucky. And you just spread it on bread. 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.460
 Or toast, if you want your bread to be harder. 

00:03:57.720 --> 00:04:00.200
 "Toast! For if you want your bread to be harder. 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.220
 That is marketing ready for the next 20 years. 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.860
 We have already talked about herbs on toast. Let's move on. 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.560
 There is now safe fugu. 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.140
 Pufferfish that has been bred to contain no poison? 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.740
 Yes. Absolutely. Well, not necessarily bred. 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:17.600
 Beaten! 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.360
 Stop it! 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.580
 Just knock out the poison. 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.480
 Specially pressed. 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.080
 For the preparations ... 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.960
 Just wring out 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.380
 Persuaded. 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.520
 "Well, do love." 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.160
 "Just do not have it!" 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.780
 Where does the poison come from in the fugu? 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:35.320
 It's something like the skin and the fins or something? 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.540
 --Gall bladder? Oh no, the skin is usually non-toxic. 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.440
 It's the liver ... also the ovaries and the eyes. But especially the liver. 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.260
 The eyes?! 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.900
 The eyes. 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.000
 Oh my god, it has poisonous eyes. 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.120
 That is a bit dark. 

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.620
 Yes. 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.460
 But where does that come from? 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:51.660
 Is it what it eats? 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:53.160
 --Point! --Ooooh! 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.760
 [DING] Completely correct. It is the food that it eats. 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.720
 It comes from other animals ... that contain bacteria full of tetrodotoxin. 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.360
 So he eats the nerve poison. Why does it not get poisoned? 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.160
 Because he has a very good ... livery secretory system. 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.720
 He is very, very hardcore. 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.580
 You know what? There you get a point for [DING]. 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.740
 He develops immunity over time. 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:22.220
 So the fish is a bit paralyzed in the beginning while eating all those bacteria with poison 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.480
 that he has built up in his system? 

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.080
 I think it is also true that he has a very strong system. 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.580
 Yes. 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.260
 But he can just continue to eat and absorb the stuff, as he does with all chemicals. 

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.340
 And he, you might say, he just pulls it out. That is it. It is a poisonous fish. 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.540
 That is the same as when I was still at school and there was that boy named John, who ate nettles. 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:40.360
 Raw. 

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:43.840
 Continue...! 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:48.820
 I told the story. There was a boy named John, who just ... 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.340
 He did not only eat nettles. That was not his whole diet. 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:53.320
 But he ate nettles. 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.740
 Why? 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.460
 --I do not know?! - It keeps someone occupied, right? 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:58.000
 It was funny? 

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:01.200
 Maybe he liked the feeling? 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:02.420
 I think that could be ... 

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.180
 What, the pecked tongue? 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:06.060
 I am not him! 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.400
 Why should I defend what weird mistakes that man made in his life? 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.920
 I do not know. You would work with him. If you are in your office, he comes in one day, opens his lunchbox. 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:19.300
 and there, a spider-ladder and a few nettles. He has come further in life. 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:24.060
 If you work with a John, ask him the next time. Do you have nettles as a child? 

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.600
 Maybe we can track him down. 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:28.140
 He is the one with the huge swollen lips, I imagine! 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.880
 So about those fish. Is there one that ... is it like people? Is there a gluten intolerant? 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:38.700
 Just like we have. "Oh, I can not eat that, I am tetrodotoxin-intolerant." 

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.260
 Yes, because they started to keep toxic free fugu 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.000
 by keeping them in tanks, away from those bacteria. 

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.380
 - "Oh sorry, I have a specific diet" - I went to say ... 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.720
 [Engine noise] Not that kind of tank! 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.280
 That would make them more dangerous than safer, right? 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:55.360
 Yes! 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.540
 We got a number ... 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:06:57.800
 "Do not eat me!" 

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:00.760
 "I have some very deadly fish here." "Oh why, is there toxin ...?" 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.840
 - "No, he has a 12-inch gun!" - "No, he controls a tank!" 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.260
 Underwater weapons. 

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:08.600
 But then, if you put the toxic into the tank, you can not even attack them with the bare fist. 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:11.480
 ... Is it all going there? 

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:12.760
 I'm stuck in a tank. 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:19.520
 Since 1958, chefs must have a license to make and sell fugu. That will take about three years. 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:21.260
 License to fugu! 

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.400
 What does the selection procedure mean? 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:26.560
 Not killing the assessor. 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:29.200
 "That was wonderful, and I can still breathe." 

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:31.360
 --No. The point is ... - "Very well done." 

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:33.200
 Who eats the fish? 

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.420
 She herself! 

00:07:34.420 --> 00:07:35.780
 Oh, he! - Yes, take a point [DING]. 

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:36.760
 That makes sense. 

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.360
 They eat their own fish. 

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.940
 So there is no one on this earth who has failed the test? 

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:44.360
 And a chef is. 

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:48.780
 And a chef is. You are absolutely right. Only about 35% actually get it. 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.680
 -- What? - Because mild poisoning makes you sick 

00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:57.920
 or something like "oh, yes, you clearly have a small dose inside, you're sick." But you are not going to die. 

00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.020
 - A small dose ... - So they are close enough to their dose 

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:03.680
 --Yes. - To stay behind with a tingling mouth 

00:08:03.680 --> 00:08:05.380
 - You have about five ... - For a few days. Yes. 

00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:08.080
 Erm, but what are the components of the test? 

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:09.360
 Catch your fugu fish. 

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:10.200
 Yes! 

00:08:10.600 --> 00:08:14.860
 There is preparation. But then there is the cleaning up afterwards. So you do not infect everything. 

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:16.140
 - That is a fair point. - We have preparation and food. 

00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:18.340
 But there is still, before we can prepare and eat at all .. 

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:19.940
 Identifying a fugu fish. 

00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:21.060
 Correct! 

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.060
 [THING] 

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:23.080
 Actually... 

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:30.060
 Because it says literally: 'a fish identification test'. 

00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:31.500
 - That's a cod. --A fish. 

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.240
 That's a fish. 

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:36.100
 That is beef. That's a fish. 

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:37.840
 So yes. That is your second round. 

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:42.720
 I mean, it is reminiscent of the British driving exams. Because that is your hazard perception. 

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:44.920
 And then you have the practical part. Which piece do we miss? 

00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:45.600
 --Theory. --Theory. 

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.220
 Point to Matt Gray [DING]. You also have a written theory exam. 

00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.860
 What happens if you feed someone fugu, and you have not done well? 

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:54.920
 "They are dead." 

00:08:54.920 --> 00:09:00.920
 Yes. How many people end up in hospital in Tokyo every year, because of fugu ... 

00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:01.640
 Thirteen? 

00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:05.420
 Okay, we clearly follow the rules of Price is Right, right? Thirteen. 

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.220
 I ... I think it will be a lot higher. 

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:12.240
 Because I can imagine it is like ordering a ridiculously hot curry. 

00:09:12.240 --> 00:09:17.900
 You specifically ask for one that has not been neutralized. Which is not neutral. 

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:20.420
 - Your question for one with poison. - I bet that's a thing. 

00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:24.700
 I bet some people like to eat them while there is still some poison. 

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:29.400
 So they get a little tingling, or something. So I think it's somewhere in the ... 

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.340
 did you say it was every year? - Year, in total. 

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.280
 I think less than a hundred, but not much less. 

00:09:34.540 --> 00:09:37.500
 I think so. Just because that was the number that came to me. 

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:42.160
 I'm going to give it to Gary. It is somewhere between about 35-65 per year, [DING] 

00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:44.200
 - That is the order of magnitude. --Yes. 

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.040
 And between 0 and 6 people die. 

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.600
 S ***** the bed. 

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:52.340
 What are the reasons that you get poisoned? Especially if it is prepared by an amateur. 

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:53.920
 Eating the poison? 

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:56.400
 - Yes, fine. - He is good, he is good (!) 

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.220
 The boy is sharp (!) 

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.480
 Incorrect methods are in between. But there is something else. 

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.140
 We've already talked about it in the test. 

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:02.720
 Lick the knife. 

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.540
 Is it served wrong because it is identified as the wrong fish? 

00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.960
 Correct. They did not know it was a fugu fish [DING]. 

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.720
 It looks ... It must look like another fish. 

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.680
 It looks like a lot of other fish. 

00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:12.520
 Oh s ***! 

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:16.280
 "Delicious sea bass ...!" [Drool] 

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.180
 [Slurring] This is a very spicy sauce. 

00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:23.840
 Codfish. 

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.040
 Cod of death! 

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:29.180
 "Now remember, I have put the dead cod left, the right one." 

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.440
 "Remember, right for the dead cod, left for the good cod." 

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.400
 "Right, left, do not forget that!" 

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.440
 "Yes, nice!" "Oh s ***!" 

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:39.520
 And they are in the same kind of pan! 

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:47.160
 All this brings us back to the Shanghai Fugu agreement. That is in 1985 in Germany. 

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.440
 Do they agree not to sell fugu in Europe? 

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:51.680
 Yes, they will not export it. 

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.760
 That is not something you can agree with people from Shanghai, do you? 

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:58.040
 We agree that we will not sell your damn murder fish, okay! 

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:02.940
 This is the Green Party. That is stuck in a coalition agreement - 

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:05.820
 their very first coalition agreement - 

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:09.740
 with the Social Democrats, in one of the German federal states. 

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:13.840
 And they go into the coalition, and they demand - on the last day of the discussion 

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:17.660
 that they sign the Shanghai Fugu agreement. 

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:22.240
 And what does this agreement stand for? What do you need to prepare fugu? 

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:22.960
 Knives! 

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.720
 Fugu! 

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.520
 Chefs! 

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:26.860
 Yep. You get a point for that. You need chefs. [THING] 

00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:28.160
 How do you get chefs to Germany? 

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:29.000
 On a train? 

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.840
 But what permissions do they need to get there? 

00:11:30.840 --> 00:11:31.560
 A licence? 

00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:32.400
 Visa? 

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:34.480
 Gary gets another point. [THING] 

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:35.680
 They need a visa. 

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.300
 And the Shanghai Fugu agreement is therefore a series of international rules. 

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:43.000
 There is a special set of visas for certified fugu chefs. 

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.820
 They demanded that this was one of the things they had to sign. What was the problem with that agreement? 

00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:49.080
 He is not right. 

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:50.560
 How? 

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:52.200
 - Shanghai? --Yes? 

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:53.300
 That is in China, right? 

00:11:53.300 --> 00:11:55.460
 Mm. That is one of the problems (!) 

00:11:55.460 --> 00:11:58.160
 - That is one of a good number. - That's not where they eat. 

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:03.140
 And - it is, at least it is pan-Asian. But that is not, you know ... what it is known for. 

00:12:03.540 --> 00:12:05.200
 It is completely fake. 

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.840
 Aaaaw! What?! 

00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:11.100
 The Greens had been negotiating for days, became ill of the discussion, 

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:16.280
 and came up with totally fake agreements that added to the requirements. 

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:20.620
 And the minister they were discussing with said just 'Yep, okay, fine! Yes. Magnificent.' 

00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:25.380
 I bet that they could beat themselves afterwards, that they had done nothing nicer with it. 

00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:26.800
 No! Nobody noticed. 

00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:31.040
 They could have let everyone carry jam on Sunday! 

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.060
 The negotiators did not notice, 

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.920
 the officials did not notice. 

00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:39.820
 They could have forbidden the apostle! The possibilities are endless! 

00:12:39.820 --> 00:12:41.720
 The press did not notice. 

00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:45.480
 It took years before someone said: 

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:47.580
 --"Oh yeah!" --"What is that?" 

00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.080
 "Do you remember that we did that?" 

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:52.860
 "We have ensured that nobody named Keith can still enter the country !!" 

00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:54.200
 You know, they could have done that. 

00:12:54.620 --> 00:12:56.360
 So did they draft the agreement? 

00:12:56.360 --> 00:13:01.160
 No, they just required the Social Democrats to participate in the Shanghai Fugu agreement. 

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:02.600
 Totally fake. 

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.560
 Without reading it. 

00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.300
 The fun you can kick with that situation! 

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:11.940
 So congratulations: at the end of all that you win, Gary, this week's show. Well done! 

00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:16.320
 You win a confederal generala, made of continuous stones without mortar. 

00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:17.320
 No! 

00:13:17.780 --> 00:13:20.280
 - Yep! Understood! --Go for it. Go for it. He has it this time. 

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:21.760
 A Dry Stone-Wall Jackson! 

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:22.980
 Yes! He has him! 

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:25.560
 We thank you for that 

00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:26.560
 Chris Joel, 

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.860
 Gary Brannan, 

00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:29.200
 - Matt Gray ... - Goodbye YouTube. 

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.000
 And I was Tom Scott. We'll see you next time. 

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:35.080
 We are doing an experimental live show of these things 

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.080
 with a live audience. 

00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.540
 If you want to be part of it, the details are now on the screen. 

00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:41.880
 Near enough to touch! 

00:13:41.880 --> 00:13:43.880
 Do ... do not do that. 

00:13:43.880 --> 00:13:45.100
 Do not touch. 

00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:49.700
 Do you want to see our faces in real life, and admire us from closer than this? 

00:13:49.700 --> 00:13:53.700
 We do an experimental live show, and you can be there if you want to. 

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:58.100
 Do you want to see us at a slightly lower resolution than on GoPro images? 

00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:01.040
 We are going to do an experimental live show! 

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.520
 Do you want to see this before it is reduced to 10 from 40 minutes? 

00:14:04.520 --> 00:14:08.560
 Well, we might be doing an experimental live show! 

00:14:08.560 --> 00:14:11.040
 You can see us for the edits (!) 

00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:13.740
 I do not really think you want that, actually (!) 

00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:16.880
 Do you like jokes that you should not hear because they fall under slander? 

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.320
 to be gross, or outright insulting? 

00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.100
 Then feel free to see us working harder and longer 

00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:24.100
 during our experimental live show! 

00:14:24.100 --> 00:14:26.800
 Do you want an hour of post-credits? 

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.580
 Come and see the experimental new live show! 

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:33.200
 Realize that we get a lot out of these things. 

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:38.140
 - The piece in the post-credits? That is this. - Just like half an hour of post-credits ... 

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.920
 It is very important to emphasize that the experimental live show 

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.320
 not the kind of experimental live show that you see in Amsterdam. 

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:47.600
 That said, the live show is for over 18, if only because one of us 

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.080
 at a given moment a joke is going to make us in trouble. 

00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.080
 And we are all going to say **** at one point (!) 

00:14:52.080 --> 00:14:56.320
 ****, ****, willies and *******! Come and see Tech Dif Live!
