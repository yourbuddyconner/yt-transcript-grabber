00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.629
 I'm just at the party and I have a few minutes to tell you, 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.750
 that gold has the number E. Èčka are the numbers issued 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.700
 The European Food Safety Authority and Gold is technically 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.460
 addition to food. You can use it as a decoration, 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.740
 in small drinks and so on. You can also get it in this form: in the form of a golden slicer. 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.859
 And that's at least cheap for the gold. Each sheet is standing 

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:25.449
 about £ 1 (approx. 35 CZK) because it is very thin: 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.189
 thinner than one micrometer. He was rolled up and rolled up and down 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.790
 flattened and embedded in this brochure. So what... 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.630
 That means you can do a lot of different things with it and one of them is, 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.219
 with a little luck, you can ... Now I have to be really careful because ... 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.649
 Do you want to look at it up close? So with some luck 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.489
 I should be able to ... 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.240
 I dipped my tongue for about one pound. 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.860
 And that's something you might not know. 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.720
 Uf, it disgusts very well. 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.150
 Does anyone else want to try? I have one more. 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.450
 And yes, since you have all asked, more or less 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.450
 it will pass without me. 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.440
