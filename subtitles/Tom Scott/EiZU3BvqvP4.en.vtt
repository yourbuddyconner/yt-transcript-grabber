00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.639
 Perpetuum mobiles have a wrong name. 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.950
 A real perpetuum mobile does not only stay forever: 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.340
 if you let an object run in space 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.440
 in a perfect vacuum, it will continue to run forever. 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.059
 However, you do not get usable labor. 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.570
 If someone really builds a perpetual motion, a real, 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.660
 then it would yield more energy than it would be put in: 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.369
 enough to overcome friction and air resistance, 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.920
 enough to continue to a mechanical defect. 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:29.920
 And just like a windmill 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.559
 you can take some of that energy for your own use. 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.890
 There are of course some physical objections for this. 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.010
 The knowledge of thermodynamics is always maintained. 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.520
 This is a device made by Thomas Young in 1807. 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.600
 It is the original, two centuries old, 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.550
 from the archives of "The Royal Institution" in London, 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.579
 that's why I have to wear gloves. 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.060
 It is an unbalanced wheel 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.440
 and there have been many perpetuum mobiles like this. 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.239
 There was a giant in Los Angeles in the early years of the twentieth century 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.899
 who advertised a pub. And according to "Popular Mechanics" 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.930
 he kept going until there was a power outage. 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.189
 And there was an inventor in 1829 who knew for sure 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:10.899
 that a car with conical wheels 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:15.310
 the world would go to the end of time. 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.149
 They all work according to the same principle: 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:20.799
 make sure that the center of gravity is always on one side, 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.179
 always out of balance on the same side. 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:25.250
 In this case, if you draw a line through the middle 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.729
 there will be more balls on one side 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:29.359
 so that side must be heavier. 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:31.189
 And when one comes to the top ... 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.889
 ... he rolls through so that that side is always pushed down. 

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:38.889
 Of course this does not work. 

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:41.090
 And that's why Thomas Young built this machine: 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.539
 to demonstrate that this is not possible. 

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:46.099
 There may be more balls on that side, 

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:48.990
 but the balls on this side are further removed from the center. 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.349
 No matter how complicated you make it, 

00:01:51.349 --> 00:01:53.030
 this wheel will rock back and forth 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.840
 and eventually choose a position where the center of mass is lowest, 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.279
 or where it stops by friction. 

00:01:58.279 --> 00:02:02.099
 But imagine it if perpetuum mobiles really work. 

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:04.340
 What is not difficult to imagine, apparently: 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.979
 there are several fraudulent companies 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.650
 who successfully knew investors to get for surprising large amounts 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.040
 and then never came up with proof of a working prototype. 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.920
 There have been so many attempts that both the American and British patent offices 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.810
 even refuse to accept the idea of ​​perpetuum mobiles. 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.340
 You can contradict physics and thermodynamics as much as you like, 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:32.250
 but there is a clearer argument against perpetuum mobiles; 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.540
 against the idea of ​​unlimited energy. 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.230
 How it is driven, 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.170
 whether it's a balanced wheel or something else, 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.200
 if you have a magic box that delivers more energy than it needs: 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.569
 what happens when you connect a small one to a bigger one, 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:47.659
 and so on, and so on, and so on? 

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.489
 Yes can start with something the size of a grain of sand 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.890
 and thus turning the earth around. 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.959
 And what happens when you connect it to yourself? 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:00.409
 If you have something that can increase the incoming energy 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.289
 Then you have a bomb after a few seconds. 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:09.580
 Thank you to "the Royal Institution"! 

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.219
 On their channel I disarm three other versions of the perpetuum mobiles 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.560
 together with someone from their team. 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.119
 Go see it!
