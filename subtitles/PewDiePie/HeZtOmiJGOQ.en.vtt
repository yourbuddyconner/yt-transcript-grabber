00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 *clap* 

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.320
 Time of apologies to the Utopians! 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.560
 "Why am I still hated?" 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.360
 "I have no justification today" 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:08.680
 "Names did not change their names" 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.500
 "Cooper I have no idea ..." 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.860
 "How to record this video my friend" 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.720
 "Welcome" 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.500
 "I, ...." 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:19.200
 "I want to make a statement about what I said" 

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.200
 It's time to show you the apologies of the Utopians 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.160
 That's right! 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.500
 For some reason I thought that this was a good idea 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.140
 you know what! 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.240
 I have already made some of the paddies to apologize .. 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:29.460
 just a little ... 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.480
 Only some .. 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.140
 So I feel that I have the basic knowledge and skill to ... 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.260
 Determining what makes the video a bad apology 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.000
 What makes the video an acceptable apology ... 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.500
 So sit down and learn if you become Utopar 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.700
 She decided to make a mistake too ... 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.000
 As a wearer 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.620
 right Now .. 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.100
 What makes an idealistic apology? 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.360
 many things .. 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:51.420
 There are several things 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.340
 Firstly : .. 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.460
 The important point you need is to begin to sigh. 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.780
 Need to tell listeners directly ... 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.720
 This video was not easy to set up and it is a heavy burden on your priest 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.680
 There is no better way to do that 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.560
 Just b ... * Boot * 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.980
 ..Benhead 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.360
 Second: All you have to do is .. 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.380
 Receive blame 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.620
 Receiving blame ... 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.140
 For anything you do, okay! 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.460
 Never take responsibility 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.140
 If you take responsibility .. 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.940
 It means you are wrong .. 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.956
 With this work .. 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.940
 No way! 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.020
 Never acknowledge the error 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.520
 In fact this is the first rule 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.640
 first rule !! 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.960
 Rule II ... 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.100
 Blame 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.080
 Rule III 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.120
 Play the role of the victim 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:30.540
 Make sure that ... 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.420
 People know this is your concern 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.240
 Okay... 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.660
 This has become a problem for you 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.340
 So you have to prepare something like ... 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.580
 To say ... 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.520
 I am exposed to bullying from the Internet ... 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.520
 "The society decided to practice bullying" 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.860
 Haha 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:50.700
 Or if it becomes a major problem ... 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.460
 What are you going to do to say that you are threatened with death? 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.380
 Because basically anyone is tampering with the Internet 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.600
 Will receive death threats 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.220
 So the Internet works 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.100
 Unfortunately, 0.01% of people are very persistent 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.000
 This is an effective way to reduce ... 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.660
 Criticism 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.160
 And the remaining 99.9% of everything, people will say ... 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.760
 sorry .. 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.260
 Uh !!! 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.820
 I'm threatened with death, okay !! 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.240
 Oh I made a mistake! 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.040
 Okay ... 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.700
 Some people decided to write abusive comments to me 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:22.200
 So ... 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.240
 I think your view is incorrect 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.980
 "I will take full responsibility ..." 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.370
 "Every one of your customers told me how much money you had ..." 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.600
 "Stolen from them, and caused them harm .. Say their names .." 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.270
 - "If you want me to ask them to ask you .." - "I would like it" 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.840
 "So why did each of your clients warn me six months ago that you ..." 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.540
 "Six months ago, I stopped working just to make money from me" - "I did not do that .. Tana!" 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.820
 You know, you can always take full blame. 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:57.100
 But the whole call on someone else 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.380
 This is an effective trick to do 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.540
 Such as ... 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.220
 You know, I take full responsibility ... 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.600
 Because you were insulted 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.800
 *Laughter* 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.120
 To see the apologies, I chose some videos .. 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.560
 * Kissing * The most perfect .. 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.080
 Cultural content on site .. Yes my apologies included with the rest 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.860
 Let us start ! 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.301
 Our first ... 

00:03:22.301 --> 00:03:23.920
 Apologize to Trevor Martin 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.260
 This video became Mimi himself (meme: is a viral cultural symbol or social idea) 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.760
 Just because it is a piece of art 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.800
 This apology ... * Kissing * Trevor Martin 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.280
 If we were to apologize for the fine wine, the chondeau wine would be 1955 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.180
 a la mon 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.640
 "I literally do not know what to say" 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.420
 Just to understand what is happening 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:46.400
 I am sure that many people know, but at the beginning T. Martin 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.900
 He ran the CS GO site for gambling .. He claimed that he had no connection to the site ... 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.510
 And see how much profit I got from the site .. This heroic friends, see I win !! 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:03.440
 Come on, children register on the site to win also .. And then what! ... 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.070
 I manage the site !! What ? I am the site's executive director? What!! 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.600
 And here is the video of the apology. Martin think, first I want .. 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.020
 I would like to admire the best way 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.660
 "Cooper I have no idea ... how to record my video" 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:29.500
 * Laugh * I can not resist liking this video 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:33.620
 Because we are only 8 seconds behind the section .. and much has happened, first .. 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.640
 He started by the dog and by the way, this is a wonderful job that you would like to add 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.180
 And you have to come to your pet animal .. animal loves everyone and everyone loves dogs 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.440
 Not only that ... he also used the dog to seek advice 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.700
 So sad dog !!!! I mean this is not a way to make a good apology 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:56.540
 I do not know what to do 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:59.700
 If you can not make your dog sad 

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.500
 To judge you 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.640
 And then begins with the most beautiful 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.100
 I did not hear a sigh before 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.220
 Soft nose openings 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.561
 The eyes are locked 

00:05:08.561 --> 00:05:09.620
 He says: Do you know .. 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.880
 It's me 

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.000
 Then we come to the background 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.100
 Not just a babysitter in **** 

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:18.760
 Do you know ... when it comes to cheating kids stealing their money 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.840
 You have to try to show your wisdom with attitude 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.240
 Maybe you should not imagine in .. 

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.100
 House entrance 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.164
 In a luxury house 

00:05:26.164 --> 00:05:27.800
 How long is this ceiling? 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.540
 And above that 

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.920
 How your car appeared 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.880
 In the background of the video 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.380
 I'm sorry ... 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:35.040
 How did this happen? 

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:38.020
 He did not just shoot his palace while apologizing 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.310
 But also added his car 

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.620
 I mean I do not know how I will 

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:48.919
 A video for an apology containing my car in the background .. This makes the situation worse 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:54.110
 "Well, I'll try, as far as I can, as beautifully as possible 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:05:57.650
 I do not want to take much of your time but first ... 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:00.840
 I want to say that .. 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.360
 First he did not want to waste our time 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.900
 And then continue to waste our time figuring out how much he loves the fanatic .... 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.490
 "I love you so much .. You mean a lot to me" 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.810
 "You know me 6 years ago in Youtube, and with all sincerity, you have changed my life" 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.400
 "I wake up early every day to achieve my dream .." 

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.920
 "I followed my feelings and all this is achieved ..." 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:23.400
 Because I lied to you 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:28.500
 I'm sure he loves his fans as much as he likes ... 

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:33.100
 As much as he likes his car and his palace so I do not think he is lying 

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:35.570
 I just want to say that this is a good way to start with it 

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:38.900
 Make sure you tell your fans that you love them right away 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.340
 But not by acknowledging any mistake it has made 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.860
 You have a lot of love and tenderness 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:51.660
 "My connection with CSGO Lotto relates to the public record since the company was founded" 

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.700
 "In December 2015" 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.340
 "However I feel that I owe you an apology I am sorry for everyone ..." 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:04.552
 "Felt that it was not clear enough for him" 

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:07.520
 I like this because he explained that ... 

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.620
 He is the CEO of his company 

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:12.040
 But the reaction is simple. 

00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:15.620
 It was a public record. It was something about people 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.340
 It's your fault .. Did you understand? 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:18.830
 Blaming .. That's what I'm talking about 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:21.120
 It's your fault! 

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.600
 I will not try to deceive you or lie to you .. 

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.340
 Is your fault did you understand? 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:26.360
 Watch the video 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.720
 It is your fault that you did not understand 

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:35.760
 He owns the site 

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.600
 I mean, all this apology is trying ... 

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.300
 To cover his actions 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:44.800
 Legal manner 

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.220
 He said this himself 

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:47.450
 "Please understand that I ..." 

00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:50.900
 "I'm trying to make sure that my channel in YouTube is in addition to all my other work .." 

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.820
 "According to law" 

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:56.500
 All in accordance with the law 

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:01.100
 A beautiful statement .. if you commit something that people do not like 

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:01.980
 Do not hit them with .. 

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:04.100
 All in accordance with the law 

00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:08.270
 I stole a child .. in a manner consistent with the law 

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:12.350
 So the reactions are not many but people thought that ... 

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:16.400
 That is a great lie and its punishment is certainly imprisonment 

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:21.290
 People said that the fine would be millions of money, but what is the ruling? 

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:25.880
 Simply nothing ... I mean I've been warned by the Federal Trade Commission 

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:31.060
 Basically if this incident is repeated again they will be fined about $ 40,000 

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:36.580
 So a person like T-Martin obviously has not changed a little 

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:40.370
 But learn this according to the law 

00:08:40.370 --> 00:08:43.719
 He still continues with his channel .. I think this is fair enough 

00:08:43.719 --> 00:08:47.949
 I do not know, there's no reason to touch these things but I'm always grateful to Martin 

00:08:47.949 --> 00:08:52.700
 For his best apology * Applause * 

00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:59.920
 I'm going to make this video .. I got 8.5 I know I said it was the best but .. 

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.100
 It could be better than that to move on to ... 

00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:09.939
 Of course a video of Laura Liz apology I do not know exactly who is Laura Liz but .. 

00:09:09.939 --> 00:09:15.910
 She seemed to be re-enraged by racist comments. * Laughter * But it's confusing in the video because I .. 

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:19.779
 I do not understand what happens. Did you seriously start like this? 

00:09:19.780 --> 00:09:26.800
 "I want to talk to you in the ... in this video &amp; ^% # ..." 

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:31.720
 * Laughter * There are no dimples! 

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:38.520
 The video has started ... If you want to clear your tears you can start the video at any stage you can not 

00:09:38.540 --> 00:09:44.680
 What you need to do is to make sure that the tear is coming and then you start recording it you can not .... you know! 

00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:54.400
 What is that !!!! *Laughter* 

00:09:54.480 --> 00:10:01.020
 12 seconds and did not say anything .. except to rub her face in a strange way and false tears 

00:10:01.020 --> 00:10:05.720
 That's good .. That's what I mean by T-Martin's video that it's not good enough 

00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:10.560
 Because he did not do the same .. This is what the video of T-Martin ... 

00:10:10.569 --> 00:10:14.680
 The topic is when you go through a dispute and the Internet hates you .. 

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:18.910
 I myself have experienced this experience and never cried at all 

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:22.920
 Because I am not a child or a woman, many are just complaining 

00:10:22.940 --> 00:10:27.400
 But it is hard work and this is what we are seeing now .. This is not an apology 

00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:34.300
 This is an attempt to understand what is happening around me trying to understand what is happening around me 

00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:40.000
 This is not an apology but an emotional emotion 

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.440
 The things that are now talked about in Twitter or other media media 

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:50.540
 "... this is the hardest thing I've ever had .. I'm so sorry ....." 

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:12.420
 * Laughter * Why is this funny to me? You know when you see someone crying 

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.440
 You do not have to laugh .. right?! But many people think it's funny 

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:21.040
 I do not know why ?! Is it because of rubbing? I can not believe nobody believes 

00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:25.480
 "I am very sorry because I disappointed your hopes ...." 

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:30.980
 My God ! What is that ? Are you a nose or mouth exporter? what happened ? 

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.280
 * Applause * You know what? This is the best video 

00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:47.020
 Some people have commented that the reason for not actually crying and sometimes tears is mild due to stress 

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:54.880
 So she really did not cry because she felt guilty but because she was trying to deal with all these feelings and that's what I mentioned earlier 

00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:04.700
 "This hurts me very much .... I have disappointed the hopes of those who have supported me for years ..." 

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:16.340
 She said nothing but "I'm better now" 

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:21.680
 But I did not show any reason to believe it I do not know maybe I'm miserable now .. I do not know 

00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:23.020
 But I saw that the subject was a bit interesting when she said at the beginning "I'm the best" 

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:28.100
 I'm better now, my friends, I'm looking for you. 

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:38.180
 "I decided six years ago to re-tweet ... tough things 

00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:43.220
 What Laura Lee did here is something special because when things spoil things 

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:48.940
 Make sure you do not overdo it as much as possible. Make sure people get the lowest form 

00:12:48.940 --> 00:12:53.400
 What did I do instead of saying that she was chirping something that was essentially a re-chant 

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:59.700
 And feel the difficulty of the matter for 6 years how does this matter ??? 

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.140
 This is the problem of this sort of thing people no longer care about when they occurred 

00:13:03.820 --> 00:13:11.820
 "I feel stupid and angry .. I have no justifications for you" 

00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:16.820
 "I'm not here to justify .. I'm here just to say I'm sorry" 

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.340
 * Laughter * You should not make excuses with an apologetic video 

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:28.120
 But it is very difficult to prevent yourself from doing what you say is .. 

00:13:28.129 --> 00:13:32.779
 I do not want to justify, but then somehow try to sneak in with excuses from here and there 

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:36.940
 "6 years ago .. I do not justify .. It is only re-twitter" 

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.980
 I am happy to have an explanation icon because frankly I do not understand what you are saying 

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.380
 This lasts for 4:44 minutes 

00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.240
 I can not afford to watch 

00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:07.880
 It is somewhat bad but good 

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:09.900
 But it's bad .. I'm sorry 

00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:15.680
 Again, there are no excuses 

00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:24.700
 "They got her phone number and attacked a child ..." 

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:29.460
 Again I feel strange when I criticize this but it is an important point 

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.940
 Not good when you receive a death threat and everyone agrees with me 

00:14:33.100 --> 00:14:42.360
 But this is also not an excuse if you receive a death threat. Go to the police This is not a reason to say to the listeners as a pardon 

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:48.700
 This has happened a lot in different media 

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:54.780
 We receive many abusive comments, death threats, bad people, and so forth. 

00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.040
 It is a kind of role playing victim mentality 

00:14:57.050 --> 00:15:02.329
 And somehow trying to say that anyone who criticizes me does these things 

00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:07.370
 So what is the style of repetition here is that Laura Liz celebrates her arrival 

00:15:07.370 --> 00:15:12.400
 5 million subscribers with Burger 

00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:19.240
 In the comments: - I'm confused .. in Youtube 4.4 million .. Hmmm 

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:24.340
 - Yes, about that. - Oh, my God, do I have news for you? - Leave the diet, and some of it may change the figure in some way 

00:15:24.340 --> 00:15:29.800
 * Laughter * I think this explains the reaction instead of apologizing 

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.160
 Because they lose subscribers 

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:36.220
 She must quickly pull off the plug and do something and act 

00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:39.960
 I want to make this video by 7 

00:15:41.140 --> 00:15:44.340
 This video contains most of the points I mentioned earlier * Applause * 

00:15:44.340 --> 00:15:47.560
 next one ! We have to Paul Paul 

00:15:47.740 --> 00:15:52.480
 I'm fed up with talking to Sean Paul but he has 53 million views 

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:54.680
 It is the most beautiful video of my apologetic time 

00:15:54.840 --> 00:16:00.180
 This is something proud of by Paul Paul * Laughter * This is a joke but it's a fact 

00:16:00.180 --> 00:16:04.780
 "I made a mistake in my decision .." 

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:09.480
 The funny thing here is why I like the video 

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:15.520
 That he made a mistake by posting his first twitter when you are in the drama or the internet mode against you 

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:21.920
 You have to classify the assessment of the situation maybe the situation will get worse or people will not care about the period 

00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:28.140
 To what extent can I deal with the situation? Do I do a video or just dictate it? 

00:16:28.140 --> 00:16:31.860
 Logan decided to make do with his Twitter only, which is a beautiful twitter 

00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:35.440
 I am sure everyone read the twitter 

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.240
 But he scored all the points. 

00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:41.800
 Instead of apologizing, you have to make sure you tell everyone about your anxiety as a person 

00:16:42.080 --> 00:16:47.120
 And that this is the first time you do something wrong in your life 

00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:50.100
 This is a good start to apologize 

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:55.060
 * Laughter * How to earn a high number of observations .. (I did not commit this work for the views, because I can actually get the views .....) 

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:59.280
 While you are not interested in this drama this is a great way to acknowledge it 

00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.380
 How do you download clips every day and because it's hard on you 

00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:09.340
 This has nothing to do with the subject and then hangs .. How much strength and power it possesses 

00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.900
 I mean, where are you apologizing? Sure, your words are beautiful .. 

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:17.559
 The sweetest theme is the emoticons * kissing * 

00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:23.800
 The beautiful apology ends with an emoticons with "Hishtaq" (Peace) after which you dare not talk to me about apologies 

00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:26.040
 Hishtaq "Laughan for Life" 

00:17:26.060 --> 00:17:30.940
 But the video is very nice but ..... most people probably hate Logan 

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.400
 But he acknowledged that this is wrong, what can you do too? 

00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:40.060
 Many people said that it was read from a screen 

00:17:40.070 --> 00:17:45.740
 And so on .. Oh he wrote an apology in a scenario that arrived but ... 

00:17:45.740 --> 00:17:51.240
 You obviously want some ideas on what you want to say this video is important 

00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:53.080
 And want to make it properly 

00:17:53.220 --> 00:18:00.860
 Frankly, I do not see any reason to argue about this as it was an attempt to deceive or perhaps someone else wrote it 

00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:03.720
 But in general I think this is acceptable 

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.380
 I do not know 

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:07.340
 No read from the screen all the time .. 

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:17.780
 A good apology is probably someone else wrote to him * laughed * 

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:21.080
 Make sure you use another language that you do not use for your regular ... 

00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:27.620
 People know that this apology is not from you, it is clear that someone wrote it to read it 

00:18:27.620 --> 00:18:30.820
 "I made a serious mistake and Astmrit by neglecting my judgment ..." 

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.020
 "I want to apologize to the Internet .." (means used Media Media) 

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:42.660
 When you submit a video to apologize you must make sure that you do not apologize to the people affected first (meaning the family of the suicide) 

00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.500
 But you have to apologize to people who are angry first * laughed * 

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:49.880
 "I want to apologize for the Internet" 1 / Internet 

00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:52.880
 "I want to apologize to those who watched the video" 2 / For those who watched the video 

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:57.920
 "More importantly, I want to apologize to the victim and his family" 

00:18:57.920 --> 00:19:04.240
 The most affected person remains the last of the list 

00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:08.620
 "I do not expect forgiveness ... I will be better than that .. Thank you" 

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:15.060
 It's a nice apology. I have nothing to say 

00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:16.900
 Blogs for life 

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:21.740
 This is my suggestion if I want to give any prosecutions 

00:19:21.760 --> 00:19:27.060
 If I want any aid I will always help 

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:33.800
 (Recommendation) Now that our time is running out I just want to take a look at some of the videos 

00:19:33.800 --> 00:19:40.300
 We have Jana Marbles .. 47 minutes "Video What happened to Asmaki" * Laughter * 

00:19:40.300 --> 00:19:44.620
 An apology for 47 minutes, but this is the world map of apology 

00:19:44.629 --> 00:19:48.889
 Many people use this kind of apology as an example ... 

00:19:48.889 --> 00:19:53.210
 Oh .. Mavaloh was lost and finished the subject in just two minutes 

00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:58.740
 But Jana Marbel made a simple mistake and cost 47 minutes in the video 

00:19:58.740 --> 00:20:01.480
 So if you mean regret 

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:07.500
 You have to play a video for 5 hours you have to show for 24 hours live broadcast 

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.140
 If you're really sorry 

00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:12.440
 Many people do a quarrel which is of course illogical 

00:20:12.769 --> 00:20:16.759
 In fact I like this video .. I find it funny to know .. Incredibly 

00:20:16.759 --> 00:20:21.889
 This is not an apologetic video, but an explanation of the error that has caused it 

00:20:21.889 --> 00:20:30.300
 She obviously bought fish and dealt with them as directed by the seller and turned out to be wrong 

00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:34.420
 This angered people that this was not the right way to deal with fish 

00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.380
 .. And then downloaded a video to respond simply: I learned from my mistake and this is the right way 

00:20:38.380 --> 00:20:41.260
 This is what I understand from the video 

00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.260
 This is nice because a lot of people do not know this 

00:20:45.260 --> 00:20:48.360
 If the seller gave you the wrong instructions 

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:52.070
 It is nice that she conveyed her experience and the correct way of dealing 

00:20:52.070 --> 00:20:56.080
 I mean clearly most people do not know how to deal with a fish 

00:20:56.080 --> 00:21:02.260
 We also have a video of Wayne Brothers and when looking back I feel sorry .. Do you remember this? 

00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:09.720
 "... and the tragedies were very bad and what we realized is that we spoiled it strongly .." 

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:12.220
 I feel bad .. 

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:14.880
 I met them .. They are nice 

00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:17.659
 I met them once. So I can not simply say: Yes, they are wonderful 

00:21:17.659 --> 00:21:22.399
 But they may not have received proper attention 

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.440
 But this apology is very bad but terrible ... the worst video ever 

00:21:27.640 --> 00:21:32.380
 It's like trying to insult you ... Did you understand? 

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:38.140
 In summary they tried to steal some feedback .. world feedback 

00:21:38.140 --> 00:21:44.560
 Because their channel for "reaction" and people: you can not try to steal the word "reaction"! 

00:21:44.560 --> 00:21:47.860
 Because this leads to stealing someone else when he writes "reaction ..." video 

00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.620
 In fact, this is true (the translator's note: the theft of the address was intended to steal the idea later) 

00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:54.900
 They said: It is impossible to do this! But even if this is unintended, you do not have to do this 

00:21:54.900 --> 00:21:57.480
 And try to comment: you are wrong .. you are wrong 

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:01.600
 It is impossible to do this. You are wrong 

00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:07.080
 The subject here is that they are not utopers but producers who are not sitting in front of the camera 

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:11.080
 They have other people performing the role 

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:16.220
 Now things are good and they obviously do well. That's unimportant 

00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:20.360
 This is something I want to share with you because it is important from my face .. 

00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.620
 Make sure you apologize correctly 

00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:28.460
 Because if your intentions are clear, you do not necessarily have to pass them through the video 

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:32.100
 I think this is a good example 

00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:37.470
 "As an example we have a YouTube channel ... so we try to protect it .." 

00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:41.400
 "Not in the way we lost our channel name thanks to someone who got a brand ..." 

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:48.460
 "But just because we have a brand does not mean we're looking for topics to steal." 

00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:50.490
 You idiots 

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:56.060
 I think I should see my apologies ... I mean, I can not criticize people's responses without acknowledging my apology 

00:22:56.060 --> 00:23:01.080
 First .. What does the cup do here? Is it possible that I did not stir this cup? 

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.560
 This is provocative for me .. I do not know why 

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:09.880
 Secondly, I am obviously in a different position here 

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:13.960
 Welcome Yaffa * laughter * 

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:18.940
 This is not the way to make an apology. * Laughter * Did you see .. I'm still learning 

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:25.180
 And also I feel that I was angry and my face does not suggest happiness 

00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:32.640
 "Hello .. I want to make a statement about what I said in the live broadcast" 

00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:39.020
 "Maybe you refuse to believe me but ... every time I hear players use that kind of language ..." 

00:23:39.020 --> 00:23:45.840
 "As I did .. I find that this behavior stupid and immature .." 

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:51.420
 "I hate that I was in this situation .." 

00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.440
 This is true .. I believe this 

00:23:54.440 --> 00:23:59.720
 But I have not given anyone a reason to believe so I think it's stupid of me to say that at the beginning 

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:03.809
 "I put him in the heat of the moment when I said the word" 

00:24:03.809 --> 00:24:08.190
 * Laughter * Because I said the heat of the moment began to me Mimi 

00:24:08.190 --> 00:24:11.340
 Because it spread through YouTube and used it 

00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:13.960
 It was during the heat of the subject. 

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:20.060
 I did not mean that, but it was clear that he had become an excuse 

00:24:20.060 --> 00:24:21.340
 I should not have said that 

00:24:21.480 --> 00:24:26.620
 "I do not want to justify this act because there are no excuses for this ..." 

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:31.420
 Because I just made a lot of excuses .. Yagby 

00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.200
 * Laughter * Come on, you can laugh 

00:24:34.340 --> 00:24:41.480
 I wish I had not started this .. It does not matter this is not our theme but it feels good when I watch how my sense changes 

00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:49.220
 "I am sorry because I disappointed your hopes .. In this situation I should have learned more .." 

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:54.300
 Yes I started forgetting the subject * laughed * 

00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:59.480
 How long has it been? Not bad .. I think I feel well 

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:06.020
 I made the important stuff here .. because when you make an apology it is important to reduce the shredding 

00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.800
 Because when you cut the video repeatedly 

00:25:09.800 --> 00:25:12.800
 People will think this is a fake apology, like you read from a screen and so on. 

00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:15.420
 But what happened with Laura Lee 

00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:18.340
 Ban contains empty content you did not speak ... 

00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:27.700
 But I want to make sure that the last part goes well 

00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:32.020
 As a saying I do not want this behavior to be repeated 

00:25:32.020 --> 00:25:35.360
 Because it is clear that this is the second time that the feast was celebrated 

00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:39.220
 I want to make sure I do not repeat this again 

00:25:39.220 --> 00:25:41.540
 Yes the theme of Twitter is sensitive 

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:50.420
 Something else I learned from my mistake 

00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:59.780
 There is a difference between the media and the general public in a way of thinking 

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:03.160
 I received a lot of advice 

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:08.000
 Given the past I am very grateful for not accepting it 

00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:11.440
 If you want to make an acceptable apology, be frank. 

00:26:11.440 --> 00:26:14.940
 Do not try to try things to fool people .. because you can not 

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.500
 People are smarter than you and will discover your trick 

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:24.520
 It's easy to say that despite my past, but this is a lesson for everyone 

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:31.500
 That's enough of the riddles, but there's plenty of time 

00:26:31.500 --> 00:26:34.460
 Good-bye
