00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.940
 I am working with Norm, and he is going to teach me the basics of stage fighting. 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.640
 What are you going to teach me, Norm? 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.840
 We start with suffocation, or actually strangle 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.420
 We are in an alley near a pub. So this is a place where many strangles occur (!) 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:14.820
 That's for sure. 

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.520
 So we start with you who strangle me. 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.260
 All right. 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.660
 Right, so the best way to do 'scenic wurges' 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.420
 is that you do not do anything. 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.660
 Okay, I like this. 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.180
 So put your hand on my breastbone, chest - 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.860
 Do you want to get closer so that I can see where I put my hand? 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.860
 - Do nothing. -- All right. 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.860
 Let me do all the work. 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.400
 I grab your hand and do-- 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.020
 Which is good! 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.180
 The most important thing is that I have the control so that I can pull your hand as tight as I find comfortable, 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.760
 so for people who are very unhappy with the idea of ​​being strangled. 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.160
 Yes. I do not like it when someone comes here. 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.920
 - So I will try it on you? - Yes, okay. 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.980
 - So you just put your hand down here? - Yes, I would put him there. 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.060
 And now you have control and I literally do nothing. 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.260
 Wow! 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.220
 There you go! 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:21.640
 Here we go! Thank you Norm! That's how you 'stagger' someone 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.640
 and that is something you may not have known! 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.260
