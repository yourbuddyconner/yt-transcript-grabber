00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.000
 Perhaps you have seen Salvation Mountain in the music videos or documentaries. 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.620
 It appeals to people 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.660
 Even for people who are not religious, this hill, 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.254
 covered with a 1.9 million liter (0.5 million US gallons) latex paint ... 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.220
 in the middle of the sun-drenched Californian desert, 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.555
 this hill has something. 

00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:17.982
 And it is all the work of one person. 

00:00:17.982 --> 00:00:20.489
 Leonard Knight was a man who, he was kind of lost ... 

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.500
 he drove around, searching for what he could do. 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.888
 He discovered Jesus, so he had a mission ... 

00:00:24.888 --> 00:00:26.092
 and he started doing things. 

00:00:26.092 --> 00:00:28.959
 He made a hot air balloon, about 200 feet (61 meters), 

00:00:28.959 --> 00:00:31.606
 sewed it all together with praise to God on it. 

00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:33.045
 Brought it here. 

00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:35.617
 The desert eventually took its toll on the balloon, 

00:00:35.617 --> 00:00:37.312
 but he stayed and he built this mountain. 

00:00:37.312 --> 00:00:39.707
 But you have to look at it from a wide perspective to get an impression. 

00:00:39.707 --> 00:00:43.109
 That sand hill, on that side, shows exactly what was here. 

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.680
 A few scrawny bushes and a flat sand hill. 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.900
 And Leonard has built all this. 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.920
 He added extra clay, hay bales, whatever, to build it all up. 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.440
 He went on and on. 

00:00:52.442 --> 00:00:53.928
 He was going to cover the whole thing. 

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:55.640
 And he never really thought about himself as an artist, 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.360
 he thought more about himself as someone who simply did his thing. 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.640
 He was a go-getter. 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.000
 The original mountain collapsed after three and a half years of construction. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.679
 He rebuilt. 

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:07.245
 He had passion, and that is so beautiful. 

00:01:07.245 --> 00:01:09.056
 28 years of dedication. 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.760
 Try to dedicate yourself now for 28 minutes somewhere, realistically. 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:14.160
 I think about that. 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.620
 Leonard Knight had no training, no group of people around him. 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.760
 The technical term for this is art brut. (outsider art / outsider art) 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.334
 He was not inspired by other people's work ... 

00:01:22.334 --> 00:01:23.939
 ... unless you count God. 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.669
 He was not imitating master artists, 

00:01:25.669 --> 00:01:27.817
 he did not ask for feedback from friends around him. 

00:01:27.817 --> 00:01:31.927
 He just made this, and that resonated with the world. 

00:01:31.927 --> 00:01:33.785
 Years after his death there is a group of people ... 

00:01:33.785 --> 00:01:36.397
 who use their time to maintain his legacy. 

00:01:36.397 --> 00:01:38.556
 We have so many people, they come from everywhere. 

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:41.379
 I met people from small countries in Africa, 

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:44.665
 to the whole of Europe, to small floating islands, 

00:01:44.665 --> 00:01:46.410
 and this and that, it's great. 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.420
 And some people come here for religious things, cool. 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.260
 Some people come here for beautiful people who take beautiful pictures in a beautiful place, 

00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:57.266
 what - be respectful, and that's cool too. 

00:01:57.266 --> 00:01:58.641
 You get out of it, you do things. 

00:01:58.641 --> 00:02:02.180
 They get off their couches and away from the TV and stuff, 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.780
 that is ... TV is great, you know, nothing against TV's. 

00:02:04.783 --> 00:02:06.722
 Paint donations that we get, here, 

00:02:06.722 --> 00:02:08.045
 most of them come from the visitors. 

00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:09.740
 They bring a few glances, 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.900
 a few cans become a few hundred cans. 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.688
 Imagine that I want to paint that heart. 

00:02:13.688 --> 00:02:15.592
 I would have to wait a long time 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.060
 until I have enough beautiful red paint to mix to dye the heart. 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.780
 And then gives so much more satisfaction 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.080
 if you did it. But the best thing is, 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.540
 that the paint really comes from the heart, from the people. 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.840
 Even if this all collapses, 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.620
 this has inspired so many people, filmmakers, pilgrims and tourists 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.460
 that it will live on in memories, in photos, and yes, in video clips. 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.700
 From the moment I knew about this, 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.613
 I wanted to come here to see it myself. 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.480
 I started here as a volunteer because 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.620
 I realized how important it was for everyone who came here. 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.073
 And so I did more volunteer work, 

00:02:46.073 --> 00:02:48.166
 and in the end they made me kind of a greeting 

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:49.698
 and I, "Da-the-dah-the-dah." 

00:02:49.698 --> 00:02:51.417
 And then I said, "Can I possibly paint while I'm greeting?" 

00:02:51.417 --> 00:02:52.531
 "Oh yes, go ahead." 

00:02:52.531 --> 00:02:53.646
 "Da-the-dah-the-dah." 

00:02:53.646 --> 00:02:54.911
 And suddenly I am the maintainer 

00:02:54.911 --> 00:02:56.304
 and have I lived here for a year and a half now. 

00:02:56.304 --> 00:02:58.928
 In my heart I am the keeper of this place. 

00:02:58.928 --> 00:03:02.040
 I have tried to paint everything the same and make it beautiful and keep it. 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.758
 If I fix it, I'll do it right. 

00:03:03.758 --> 00:03:06.313
 If I can not repair it properly, do not fix it yet, leave it alone, 

00:03:06.313 --> 00:03:07.671
 Leave it alone until you can do it well. 

00:03:07.671 --> 00:03:09.877
 The biggest thing is: it's all about love. 

00:03:09.877 --> 00:03:12.814
 Leonard's love was God, and his relationship with Jesus. 

00:03:12.814 --> 00:03:14.788
 But all forms of love are great. 

00:03:14.788 --> 00:03:18.180
 For example, these people all like driving around and hanging out, doing things. 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.860
 That makes everything better. 

00:03:19.861 --> 00:03:22.462
 We do not think about all the stupid mess in this world. 

00:03:22.462 --> 00:03:24.300
 And you know what? Then the stupid mess in this world becomes 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.277
 really the stupid mess in this world 

00:03:26.277 --> 00:03:27.902
 and that has no expressiveness. 

00:03:27.902 --> 00:03:31.385
 There are not many places in this world where it is good, 

00:03:31.385 --> 00:03:32.906
 and where nothing is expected of you. 

00:03:32.906 --> 00:03:34.230
 We hope that you donate money to us 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.080
 because that's how we do it, but if you do not, cool! 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.380
 We still have free souvenirs, and there are constantly things going on. 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:42.340
 But if you come here on a Saturday, you get to see what this is really about. 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.456
 It's just crowded with people who like it, 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:46.900
 respecting the mountain, respecting each other, it is great! 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.320
 Some people would say that it is divine inspiration. 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.960
 Some people would be more cynical and someone should have done it. 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.333
 Of all millions, maybe billions of people 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.640
 who have ever tried to make art without experience and without training - 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.277
 yes, statistically someone had to win the jackpot. 

00:04:02.277 --> 00:04:05.992
 But it's hard to be cynical ... here. 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.480
 So I took a few cans of paint as part of my own pilgrimage, 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.379
 because what appears, 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.296
 I want to help preserve this. 

00:04:14.296 --> 00:04:16.296
