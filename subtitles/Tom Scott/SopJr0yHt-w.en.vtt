00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.100
Those big round things behind me are gasometers

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.600
Or at least they were, now they're deactivated, disused, and awaiting demolition.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.200
But there used to be one or more of these in every town and every city up and down Britain.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.020
This was when gas was not a thing piped in from the North Sea and beyond

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.240
but instead something that was made in a gasworks by burning coal

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.080
and that gas would be stored inside these

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.060
Now that blue one is a bit special, it had a piston that would go up and down inside

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.760
depending on how much gas needed to be stored. But those scaffolding ones there

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.800
they are currently empty and so the tank is down in the ground

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.880
But it would telescope up - be pushed up by the pressure of the gas inside it in order to store however much needed to be in there.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.740
And they would rise and fall throughout the day, the gas works would spend day and night generating gas

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.920
steadily the gasometer would rise

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.620
And then, in the evening as people turned on most of their cookers, but perhaps their heating as well

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.560
that gas would be pushed out of it, and it would steadily fall down to the ground.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.020
But now, well, they're not needed any more because that's a really inefficient way to store gas

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:11.600
with modern technology, all the gas that would be in there can be stored in a 50 meter stretch of high pressure pipeline underground.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:17.360
So, there aren't that many left, they've been steadily demolished ever since the turn of the 20th century, perhaps a little earlier.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.960
And now there are very few left. What aren't up for demolition

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.760
are either listed or protected buildings or aren't long for this world.

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.180
So they are a bit of Britain's industrial heritage that we will soon be saying goodbye to forever,

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.560
But in the meantime, if there's still one near you, well, that's what it used to be used for.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.960
Say goodbye because it probably won't be around for long. That's a gasometer, and that is something you might not have known.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.100
