00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.869
 * Music of War * Veronica Wang, 

00:00:01.869 --> 00:00:06.320
 Pokimane, Alinity, and Ray William Johnson. 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:10.860
 What about these people they have in common? They are copystriking! This is true, 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.389
 All these people have a history of multiplication multiplication 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.700
 Videos. 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.920
 Now, there is nothing inherently wrong about sharing okay? 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.200
 But I believe that these strikes are motivated by copyright, m ​​... 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.900
 * Stop War Music * 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.560
 ... worth mentioning at least. 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.940
 Recently, Jameskii conducted a video about how to close his channel almost 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.560
 Mother, 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.360
 Because he got a copyright strike because someone did not like what he said in a video. 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:36.860
 right Now, 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:42.980
 I personally have a lot of experience in the field of copyright and I think it is in everyone's interest on this site 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.640
 Mother ... 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.200
 ... We talked about this in today's video, as well as I can get a larger viewing time. 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.060
 And therefore... 

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.960
 Do not keep watching the players. 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.000
 * Equals three sound effect * 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.400
 Our first twitch twitch is Ray William Johnson. 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.440
 Remember Ray? 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.205
 Ray William Johnson hit a copyright channel called "Hoover". 

00:00:57.205 --> 00:00:58.400
 [HOOVER] Ray William Johnson 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.340
 Himself, - (I'm pretty sure) - took down the [bass] video. 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.249
 Now I have no idea why he did it, but I have made that claim 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.460
 Claimed the entire video, 12 minutes, everything. 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.720
 So the superiority was 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.080
 The original pieces were lost 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.420
 The parts we just talked about are 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.160
 Now, usually outside the obvious final appeal 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.420
 But the thing is that if you take the video in full, then this appeal is seen as he gets it out 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.540
 This is a copyright infringement on my ass. There are no good parts of this 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.339
 So the title of the video was deleted by Ray, and William Johnson was interesting 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:34.859
 Ray William. Johnson thought he was capable of singing, and was basically making fun of the video 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.380
 Reverts the old Johnson singing 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.849
 Career or old music in the first place and ask the question: Was this video deleted if it was called? 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:52.289
 Singing Johnson sings like a ray of angel. William. Johnson played down musical genius. I do not think so 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.019
 Well, now the video comes back again 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.540
 So I suppose they solved this but I think it's important to note that this has not just happened 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.589
 Solution because Ray William Johnson believes in himself. Maybe I should not have downloaded this video I will remove the claim. Not got 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:15.600
 Probably thanks to a lot of YouTube users who raise their voices and help this channel and a lot of popular anger on Twitter 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:19.169
 Copyright claim has been removed. I find this very hypocritical 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:26.819
 Coming from someone who went to court to fight for fair use raywilliamjohnson who made a career? 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:34.800
 Mainly from the content of other people responding to it and adding their own comments. Just as Hoover did now to be just 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:42.119
 And i appreciate that. Raywilliamjohnson took down the claim. Nor can I be sure what the motive behind the claim was originally 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.390
 I can not tell the truth that it was because people ridiculed him 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.460
 I think what we'll find today is a common theme people did not like in the video 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:57.179
 So it has been deleted. I already know the example illinit II, but I will bring it because I think it is important though 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.740
 This is very annoying 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:00.820
 Stupid 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:08.159
 Uni Twish believes, they win me. Well, they will not go away with my stupid thoughts no 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.819
 Seriously used it 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 I will copy the blow of this man 

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.140
 Just for that word 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.140
 Will copy it 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.520
 Yo, so I did not even call Alina de joke I thought I used a word basically was enough for her to think about 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.939
 I will be asking for revenue from this video and I think this has revealed the second problem in copyright infringement 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.309
 They sent me $ 700 last month 

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.890
 From a hit struck people 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.639
 Good money. So this reveals the second problem with the copyright strike 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:46.080
 It is the motivation for monetary games to hit the content of others 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.720
 on the principle 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.790
 If you request a video, you'll receive all of that revenue from that video 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.069
 So weak here tried to use the motivation to use two bad words against me 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:03.899
 So I'm all that revenue in this video, that's me now. Thank you so much. Revenue. I was in this person's video 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:11.310
 Yes, I mean they basically steal, and there are a lot of companies that share banners 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.649
 Specifically so that they can claim the content that has been re-uploaded to YouTube in a way that you can understand but I also find it ironic 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:26.760
 Because the comment is usually just a posteriori there. They do not add anything to it 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:32.610
 I do not even know why people are bothering to reload these at least that YouTube users may argue that their work is my conversion 

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.439
 Understanding each other the world will be a better place. That's true. That's all I care about 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.309
 I just want people to be happy with me. This is number one priority 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:47.189
 Crush like on this video. Sorry, we will get this abuse. That would help me a lot. Thank you very much for watching 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:49.410
 Be sure to hit the shepherd 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.279
 So become a sponsor so you can see it and 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.140
 That's all for me right now. Thank you guys so much to see. - I 'il see you guys. 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.190
 Well, oh Hey Sherut hit the subscription 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:15.180
 Goddammit, what are you doing? I'm not here to call. Well on anything else involved in the third example 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.500
 Exhibition c 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.970
 Veronica Wang 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:21.510
 disappointing. I thought I gave her the benefit of doubt 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.399
 But they were basically attacking a channel to the degree that it was almost deleted 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.620
 Why why they did not like this channel content 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:35.669
 He did not like how the video mocked her and people did not like her 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.049
 Watching the video he was making fun of was making her more fun for her 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.340
 I am representing my own subscribers, and I want to prove to them that it is OK to stand up for yourself 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:47.669
 So I made a video of me making fun of me 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:55.889
 Literally a video makes fun of me to show people, you know, if anyone is allowed to make fun of me 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:56.700
 I will have 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.249
 So this reveals another big problem in my opinion 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.820
 It is somewhat similar to the boky-d situation 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.820
 Pokie Home She hit this video called Keemstar Vs Pokemon Twitter Fight against the sniper and the Wolf Boy 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:12.959
 Now I know about this video because it was pushed everywhere by YouTube 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:18.660
 It was basically a Twitter dispute between keemstar and pokey mind. They uploaded videos to each other 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:23.219
 I do not know coz king my mom sir. And why the Pokemon decided. Yes, I will make a video too 

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:28.380
 None However, one of them decided to put these two videos together and upload them to YouTube 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:33.839
 Next, the YouTube algorithm thought this was an interesting video that people wanted to see and push everywhere 

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:40.279
 This Twitter drama has become a bigger drama. thanks. YouTube algorithm 

00:06:40.279 --> 00:06:44.689
 Somehow, I understand why you'd like to delete this video because of this 

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:49.818
 The selected command swells and becomes larger. Thanks for the YouTube system being 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:57.529
 Kind of stupid at least I can fairly understand the motive behind trying to download this video but the problem here is 

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:04.549
 The same problem that occurs with every example you bring into this video is that you are attracting more attention to it 

00:07:04.729 --> 00:07:10.788
 It's a Streisand effect every time you try to hide something and more people will discover it 

00:07:10.979 --> 00:07:15.619
 This made all these examples lie. I think what bothers me 

00:07:16.499 --> 00:07:19.579
 Most of all is hypocrisy 

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:24.289
 You know Ray William Johnson went to court for fair use 

00:07:24.749 --> 00:07:28.669
 But hit the content of another channel to load it fine 

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:34.878
 All these people you've raised today have examples of using other people's content for their own content 

00:07:34.879 --> 00:07:41.179
 They can get all copyright manuscript in the same way. They destroy the copyright of other people or claim their videos 

00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:43.279
 I do not know exactly what percentage 

00:07:43.279 --> 00:07:48.648
 But I say 90% of the content on the Internet or on YouTube is at least at its end 

00:07:48.899 --> 00:07:51.709
 The original content is not 100 percent. It 

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:59.628
 Commented on her review of her play. I mean people tell me the whole time. Hey just make original content 

00:07:59.629 --> 00:08:06.889
 Well guess what? Each single-channel game is not an original content. They interact with someone else's video game. It's someone else's content 

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.810
 They do not have their rights 

00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:16.009
 The same way with any other reaction, but fair use because it is a transformational work because you add a comment to it 

00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:21.800
 Remember when Sean Vanamen decided to give me a DMCA action for copyright infringement 

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:26.210
 He did not like what I said in a live broadcast that had nothing to do with his game 

00:08:26.399 --> 00:08:30.949
 Although they are granted general authorization on their website. You are free to use our game 

00:08:30.949 --> 00:08:34.158
 So they can basically revoke it at any time 

00:08:34.159 --> 00:08:37.068
 If there is anyone if you have permission to use someone's content 

00:08:37.069 --> 00:08:41.779
 You can still get a copyright strike because YouTube is not primarily interested in any of these 

00:08:41.779 --> 00:08:47.448
 I feel very confident that if I take Sean Fineman to court or his company to fight this claim 

00:08:47.449 --> 00:08:52.619
 Which is essentially what DM told the master if they fought against him 

00:08:52.620 --> 00:08:58.169
 But I feel confident that I will win this and waste him and his company time and money 

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:01.500
 Well my time as well, obviously they are not cheap either 

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:07.349
 I mean h3h3 went to court which one consistently hundreds of thousands of dollars fifty thousand dollars 

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:10.439
 I think they welcomed a check but the problem here is YouTube 

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:17.430
 So strongly to the person who makes the claim the way the system works and I will explain it for the 100th time 

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.840
 I'm sorry for all this 

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:23.519
 You can either get a claim or a copyright strike if the video is claimed to be saving the video 

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:27.960
 But they take all revenue if you receive a violation for copyright infringement 

00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.060
 But they still take all the revenue if you claim the video as a creator 

00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:41.399
 This dispute claims that you are not mistaken because of this claim and that it is mainly due to the person making the claim 

00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:46.740
 actually no. I'm right so you're not only getting money, but you're also dictating whether you're right or wrong 

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.019
 The system messed up too 

00:09:49.020 --> 00:09:55.139
 If you do not double the mud to the claim, it will automatically be directed to the copyright strike 

00:09:55.180 --> 00:10:01.859
 Basically, as an originator if you get a claim, you are very angry, but if you are the person who makes the claim 

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:06.629
 There is basically no repre conscience. I mean that you can claim everything you want YouTube will not go 

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:10.530
 Stop doing that and as a creator, you risk closing your channel 

00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:17.430
 I mean, this is what happened to James now because he got a copyright strike if you got a copyright claim as you say 

00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:24.180
 Well, we'll take this to court after that. This is the only way we can settle this history, which represents two examples 

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.700
 h3 h3 and raywilliamjohnson 

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:33.569
 Both argue that their content has been transformative and fair and applies in fair use and guess what they want 

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:37.110
 Make a comment on your videos and add your account 

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:43.619
 Reactions and all that - they apply to fair use at least from what we have seen so far 

00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.730
 So if you publish the copyright to a channel or even claim a channel 

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:52.650
 Take the risk of going to court and losing a lot of money 

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:55.829
 Therefore, it is generally helpful to abuse this system 

00:10:55.830 --> 00:11:01.570
 That many people seem to be doing without even thinking about crash questions because YouTube is not real 

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:03.909
 Its immediate application is 

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:07.630
 Awesome idea to do this. Not just for money 

00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:15.909
 But also because everyone will hate you. I mean the one thing that holds YouTube together at this point 

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:21.909
 It is the public outcry or popular anger towards people who misuse the system and if not 

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:27.490
 I mean the whole thing will spread. You also just attract more attention to what you're trying to hide 

00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:32.530
 So, can you stop just stopping abuse and copyright? It is not that difficult 

00:11:32.530 --> 00:11:38.140
 Do not remove videos, even if they show you in a negative way. It's a terrible idea 

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:40.750
 stop doing that 

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:46.359
 Stop downloading videos YouTube needs to add a removal request 

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:52.539
 The only way to download the video now is by violating the copyright request for removal. Let's just say 

00:11:53.090 --> 00:11:59.500
 Well, you give the user two or three days to download the video, then if he does not say at that time, then 

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.010
 Moves to a copyright strike 

00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:05.080
 The way you do it now is the only way to download your video by infringing copyright 

00:12:05.150 --> 00:12:08.769
 I think the removal request will solve a lot of problems 

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:14.650
 I mean, there are times when I had to strike copyright because of a video 

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:21.370
 I just wanted to be shown for a specific time and asked people not to enter this video really because they were waiting for me only 

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:23.919
 To take it down is to give it a copyright violation and people have done it 

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:27.310
 Anyway, real people are still going to the video, you're like, well 

00:12:27.310 --> 00:12:30.760
 Well, I must give you a copyright strike now, such as my unwillingness to do so 

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:33.339
 But YouTube does not have another way to download a video 

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:40.719
 So the removal request at least would be a fair warning between my last two points at least. I'm sorry 

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.780
 It was super long 

00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:47.230
 The last point is a few years back Nintendo announced it 

00:12:47.690 --> 00:12:50.889
 Mainly to download Nintendo games on YouTube 

00:12:50.890 --> 00:12:52.890
 They must be part of their partnership 

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:58.299
 Program for me personally, many people criticized this idea because it is just a bad idea 

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.969
 You will miss a lot of free marketing 

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:08.860
 It's basically what people are playing games and now they have announced that they are closing the program in the way 

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:16.469
 YouTube works on YouTube or on the internet in general that most people benefit from sharing these different things? 

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:22.469
 Game developers know it's free marketing for people playing their games. They even pay YouTube users to play their game 

00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:27.660
 They even pay to make it look like it. There are YouTube users playing their game even though they are just actors 

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:33.450
 This is how effectively this whole thing sharing ecosystem works people work 

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.560
 Watch and reply to other people's videos that help this creator 

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:42.839
 They receive some content of participation, something that everyone benefits from, not just for promotion 

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:49.649
 But also makes everything more fun in my opinion. This makes the animations enjoyable and all these different references and anything 

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.990
 It's really bad with people who abuse copyright infringement. Stop 

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.160
 Videos multiplication copyright 

00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:57.700
 Okay 

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:05.429
 Just stop making it worse, every YouTube tool has the tools to make everyone strike copyright 

00:14:06.010 --> 00:14:11.579
 Stop using it. It's already bad enough now with Article 13 

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:15.419
 Maybe you've already heard about it will make it worse 

00:14:15.790 --> 00:14:20.700
 Remained 11 days before the decision on article 13 

00:14:20.740 --> 00:14:23.849
 I strongly encourage you to sign this petition 

00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:30.510
 Right now to sign the petition we need to protect the Internet works YouTube system 

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:33.360
 It also works. Hassan. that's the problem 

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:40.920
 The stuff we will use the system and sign this inspiring tradition is this. Thank you guys so much. I love you guys a lot 

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.050
 See you tomorrow, guys. Good-bye 

00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:45.420
 Bye you think the video is over? 

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:53.370
 80 million club is here. everybody. Can we copy this guy right? 

00:14:55.319 --> 00:15:01.248
