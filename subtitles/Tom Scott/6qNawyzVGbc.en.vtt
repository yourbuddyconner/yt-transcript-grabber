This is the Technical Difficulties, we are playing Citation Needed

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.840
Joining me today: he reads books you know,
it's Chris Joel!

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:10.240
Variously verbally, vociferous, verbose, violent, and venile are we.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.500
You're doing a different letter each show?

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.780
I have up to now, I'm going to have to think up some kind of crazy third letter now, but...

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.280
The bounciest man on the internet: Matt Gray!

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.240
Hello Youtube!

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:22.900
And everybody's favourite Gary Brannan - Gary Brannan!

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.900
Join me in my balloon to the moon!

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.540
I... I...

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.920
Is that a euphemism?

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:31.840
I'm not sure if I want to do that or not. On the plus side, it's a balloon to the moon

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.600
On the other hand, it's Gary's balloon to the moon

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.100
Do you have respiratory equipment?

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.840
Gas in it, in't there?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.840
There will be with you in there!

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.200
"There's gas in it, in't there"!

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.480
In front of me I have an article from Wikipedia and these folks can't see it.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.100
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [ding]

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.480
and there's a special prize for particularly good answers which is

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.560
And today we are talking about the boobrie.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:01.640
It's a bird.

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.900
Oh, yes! Point! [ding]

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.660
Cut, print, done!

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.580
And as the bullet of mirth headed for the tit-shaped gagfest...

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.320
Where's the hyphen in that?!

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.620
I'm trying to diagram the sentence and it's not happening

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.680
Anywhere you could put a hyphen changes the...

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.460
Is it an Australian bird?

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.300
No, it's not. You're in pretty much the exact opposite around the Earth

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.080
-- Norwegian!
-- Not... not, uh, about...

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:33.040
-- Canadian!
-- West Coast of Scotland.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.960
You're right, it's a bird... sort of

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.440
It can also appear in other forms

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.380
-- Is it a fish?
-- No.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.000
In the same way that a duck is a fish?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.960
A wee mythical beastie!

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.840
Oh, it is, have a point. [ding]

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.300
A shape-shifting-ma-thing

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.840
-- I was going to say
-- You know what...

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.000
Well this is a quick one isn't it?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.740
Instant points. Instant biscuits.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.360
Do I get a point for mentioning Kelpies and Selkies?

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.000
Oooh

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.160
Other shape-shifting Scottish beasties

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:58.760
Yes, you can have a point for that as well [ding]

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:59.960
Do you want to talk about the Kelpies?

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.840
Err. I can't remember which way round a Kelpie and a Selkie is

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.620
it's a thing that looks like a seal that transforms into a people on land or something like that

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.300
-- or shape shifts
-- Shape shifting water spirit.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.360
-- Can you get a selkie stick?
-- Ugh!

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.780
A thing that changes from a seal to a person, while walking out of the sea?

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.580
That's just a very unobservant person on land, isn't it?

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.300
Well, yes! That's how shape-shifting myths happen.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.160
They've looked away, they've looked back, there's a man. And at no point have they gone

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.020
"'the two of these aren't related".

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.460
They've gone-

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.880
"Hoots mon!"

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.260
Ideally held up the bottle they had in their hand, rubbed their eyes,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.000
stared at the bottle, shook their head, and put it back down again

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.160
And then debated whether it can be deep-fried and whether it'd taste good with Irn-Bru.

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.920
The reason I said sort of earlier on, as it may appear in other forms

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.580
because it's a shape-shifting entity

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.780
"It's just a thing!"

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:47.820
Bullsh*t!

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.540
Ah, water -- have a point, water-bull! [ding]

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.900
-- What?!
-- Water bull.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.720
A water bull, what's a water bull?

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.620
It's another mythological Scottish creature

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.280
Shape-shifts!

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.700
So it shape-shifts into another made-up thing?

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.240
Yeah, yeah

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.520
Couldn't it be more inventive and shape-shift into something that isn't a shape-shifter?

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.720
The water bull is said to reproduce with standard cattle, how can you tell what's happened?

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.860
Is there a puddle of water underneath?

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:15.880
Size of their ears.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.120
Of course there is, naturally it's the ears.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.600
Yes, the water bull has big ears, not flippers, not a fin, not anything like that

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.100
-- It's not that someone got a cow and-
-- Smaller ears.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.820
threw it off a dock, into the... a harbour.

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.660
-- Can I ask a question?
-- Yes.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.760
Are there "major issues" with this article?

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.980
No, none at all!

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.800
-- Are there any references?
-- Perfectly cited!

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.560
Well it's obviously true then(!)

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.840
We've got a lot of good references here.
A lot of mythological tales,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.080
particularly Gaelic ones have been very, very well studied

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.060
So you have a trail of bollocks!

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.540
Yes! Yes I do.

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.360
Does anyone want to come up with an explanation of what it might be?

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.360
It's fairly early on, here. You have a big bird that makes a bellowing sound

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.820
that sounds like a bull.

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.620
Is it a bittern?

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.440
Not quite, it's extinct now, this goes back into mythological times.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.540
Dodo!

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:05.600
Uh, no.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.460
Great bustard.

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.400
You're in the right area, it's great something.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.560
That's what they went to school for, isn't it?

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.720
Well I thought, boobrie, great bustard...

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.280
Great auk.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.520
I was gonna say! F***'s sake! I had awk in my head!

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.880
Why didn't you say it?!

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.320
Because I thought it was like, Australian or something like that

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.460
Nah, I just thought it wasn't a British bird basically, the awk. I didn't think it was...

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.000
It isn't anymore because it went extinct halfway through the 19th century

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.780
-- Was it shot a lot then?
-- Erm, the auk...

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.980
It was probably delicious!

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.980
That's why most things are extinct!

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.100
"Aah, you should've seen this thing!"

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.640
An easy shot!

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.360
The bird's down was in high demand in Europe, which largely eliminated the European populations

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.960
by the mid-16th century

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:50.940
It was a beneficiary of many early environmental laws...

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.540
Yeah, but not enough, though,
'cos they killed them all!

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:59.220
The 3rd of July, 1844, the last two confirmed specimens, off the coast of Iceland,

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.040
what happened to them?

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:01.280
-- Died.
-- Yeah. [ding]

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.020
In a freak parachuting attempt.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:07.540
Yeah. It does say 'were killed' so basically some...

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.660
"That's the last two there, I'm gonna have that."

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:10.920
"They're mine."

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.920
"My name's in books now!"

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:15.560
That sounds like a case for Detective Inspector Bird!

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:21.320
Cue title sequence.
Bird in a little detective's hat... in the rain

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.880
I just thought it would be that same Land Rover going down a dirt track

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.780
that they've all got.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.660
I've just looked down this, on the Great Auk

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.800
The last pair, found incubating an egg, were killed on 3rd of January, 1844

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:39.260
on request from a merchant, and the people who killed them are named.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.940
Jón Brandsson, Sigurður Ísleifsson, I'm probably mispronouncing the surname there,

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:48.360
-- strangling the adults.
-- Woah! That's cold.

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:52.660
Woah. If you're gonna kill the last two of a species do it with your bare hands!

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.200
It gets colder, it gets colder. And Ketill Ketilsson...

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.540
-- Did he kettle them?
--- So Ketill, son of Ketill?

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.220
Yup, Ketill, son of Ketill

00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:01.900
Are we sure this was a man and not an implement?

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.300
Don't forget, they're incubating an egg, what did he do?

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.720
Boiled it and ate it.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.240
Smashed it. Just smashed it.

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.420
Oh, what a cock! He didn't even get a delicious meal out of it.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:10.920
Um, we-

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.180
Because they came alone with no "soldiers".

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:22.360
Literally it was as cold as that. They got interviewed later and just said:

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:26.100
"I took him by the neck. He flapped his wings. He made no cry and I strangled him."

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:32.480
As you looked into that bird's cold eyes, and just went: "shhh."

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.700
"This is the last member of this species!"

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:38.860
You do wonder with it being a merchant, it's like:

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.340
"I want the last immaculate skin", which is why they didn't shoot it or something

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:44.520
Yes, that's why they weren't shooting it.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.980
They wanted the skins.

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:50.120
But that was the bird that they thought might be causing the sightings of the boobrie

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.820
What does it normally prey on?

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.920
Small, little cushions.

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:54.600
Small, little cushions?

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:56.600
Pray! Ohh...

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:00.260
Oh wow, that's...

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.300
No! Fear!

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.960
Preys on fear?

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.640
Ah, animals on ships.

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:06.160
Entire boats, this thing eats?

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:10.720
No, it just sneaks along when you've got a boat that's transporting a lot of animals

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:12.560
Takes one.

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:13.420
The whole boat?

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:15.160
No, the whole animal though. The whole animal

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:16.200
How big is this thing?

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.200
The great auk's about that big!

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:21.700
Mythological creatures, weird sightings, you know, you'll get all sorts of...

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.360
-- And in the days before glasses...
-- Yes.

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.600
Then it was blurry and that big!

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:29.700
Can we rule out it wasn't one of these things that sank the Titanic?

00:07:29.700 --> 00:07:32.820
Yeah, I think we can rule-- it didn't shape shift into an iceberg.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.920
That's not listed anywhere in here.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.520
No great auk's ever been found with red paint smeared ominously on it.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:42.740
I wish-- what we need's a crash zoom into an auk, just...

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.880
with the big red line down it's side!

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:49.080
While it blinks once and smiles.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.880
They will also shelter on land in overgrown heather

00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:53.820
-- Who's she?
-- There we go. Thank you!

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:55.300
I set it up...

00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.840
The boobrie can also manifest itself into another form. A very creepy form.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.880
Paul Daniels.

00:08:05.320 --> 00:08:06.200
Lizard.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.160
Airships.

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.700
They're not creepy!

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:09.660
They are at night.

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:14.340
That's true. That's true. Airships sneaking up on you in the middle of the night.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.520
When you're walking along.

00:08:16.520 --> 00:08:18.680
You just wake up and there's one in your face.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.640
You're telling me you wouldn't go...

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:23.440
-- when you saw that?
-- That's fair, that's fair

00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:25.480
Has it got a little face painted on the front of the airship?

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:26.360
Yeah, 'course it has

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.280
Just smiling unnervingly.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.700
Well it's smiling unnervingly, you look away, you turn back, it's frowning.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:34.720
You've written a Doctor Who plot there about airships.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:35.920
Moffat, it's yours.

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:39.900
I mean, what, this is a litany of other things it could be.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:43.280
Well, no, different kingdom here. So not animalia.

00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.040
A rock!

00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:44.860
Is it a plant?

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.020
I was going to say, is it a rock?

00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:46.980
An insect.

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.180
Oh, piss off!

00:08:48.180 --> 00:08:52.860
A large insect that sucks the blood of horses, with tentacles and feelers.

00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:53.960
But only horses.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.700
Do insects have tentacles?

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:56.840
No.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:09:00.100
Well, it's not even consistent, that's my bother with this.

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.620
Most mythology isn't all that consistent, to be fair.

00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:05.040
Well, if you're gonna make something up, at least you make it up consistently

00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:09.200
At least my airship one was, you know, consistent with the flying, inanimate objects

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:13.620
It's partially an insect, partially Saturn(!)

00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.220
And partially swamp gas.

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.060
Of course it is. This is someone excusing their massive fart, isn't it?

00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.580
You are not getting away with calling what you did earlier "swamp gas", Gary.

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:30.060
No. Oh, it was the boobrie everyone, that's what did it(!)

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:34.140
There is an entire category here on Scottish legendary creatures.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.180
Right. For a political joke:

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.480
the Conservative Party.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:40.520
There we go.

00:09:41.740 --> 00:09:45.380
What is it? More pandas in Edinburgh Zoo than there are Scottish Conservative MPs.

00:09:45.380 --> 00:09:47.100
Yeah, and they're both Tories!

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:49.060
What? The pandas?

00:09:49.060 --> 00:09:50.240
Yeah! Viciously!

00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:53.920
"We've got a habitat. I don't see why any of those other pandas should."

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.920
"We could let them in, but why should we?"

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:57.560
Gets out the Telegraph and just goes...

00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:04.460
Pandas can be like embittered, late-40s Tories!
They live together, they don't have sex,

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:08.320
they don't fraternise with other kinds,
they've got a very restrictive diet

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:10.240
UK Independence Pandas.

00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:16.680
Someone I know has a big thing against pandas, right. And they have a very long list

00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.940
"F****ng kill 'em!"

00:10:17.940 --> 00:10:20.820
Yeah, basically, they don't need to survive anymore,

00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:25.300
they've bred themselves out of existence, so why are we bothering?

00:10:26.300 --> 00:10:31.400
Not actually a bad argument that one. Pandas are basically an evolutionary dead end at this point

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:32.480
They failed Darwin's test

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:37.040
But they weren't, and like a lot of species we came along and messed things up for them

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.480
but, at this point...

00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:39.900
And they vote Tory(!)

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.160
Yes. Fact. Fact.

00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:44.760
We've established this, that pandas are Conservatives.

00:10:45.660 --> 00:10:48.860
I'll tell you what, the best way to get a candidate to read your thoughts --

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:51.500
I can say this 'cause it will be after the election when this goes out

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.540
If you spoil your ballot, if you put more than one cross in a box,

00:10:54.540 --> 00:11:00.560
every candidate has to stand around and look at that to agree that more than one cross is on that bit of paper

00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.900
I have literally been in that meeting.

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.280
You have been there. If you put two crosses and write "you're all dicks"

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:10.600
they all have to read that to make sure that you didn't put one preference more than the other

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.180
and that is a genuinely spoilt ballot.

00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.640
So there you go, if you're gonna make a protest, call them all ****s and put two crosses in

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:22.380
there's nothing better than seeing a row of electral candidates reading what people think about them

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:26.160
as they all go "yes, yes, uh, and too, and my mum!"

00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:31.380
On that note, on that note.
Congratulations Gary, you win this week's show

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.220
The camera can't see you, you're in the darkness

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.320
You're in the dark!

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.880
Congratulations, you win leafy green vegetables from one of the fathers of computing

00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.560
Babbage's Cabbages.

00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:46.280
-- Thank you very much to Chris Joel
-- Bye!

00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:47.100
Matt Gray!

00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.100
Gary Brannan!

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.740
I've been Tom Scott, we'll see you next time!

00:11:54.380 --> 00:12:00.800
