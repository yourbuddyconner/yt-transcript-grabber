00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.009
 This is the Old Royal Naval College in Greenwich. A place mentioned in the list of world heritage sites 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:05.941
 that most Americans and 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.719
 let's be honest, most Brits, know as "That place that was blown up in Thor 2". 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.889
 But blowing that up would have been a door handle of a lot different 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.789
 if it happened a few decades earlier. For many years 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.220
 this was a training base in use for the Royal Navy. That is where the name "Old Royal Naval College" comes from 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.250
 That was not so long ago. 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:25.670
 Marines were trained here in the mid-1990s. 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.279
 And, well, the Royal Navy has nuclear submarines. 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.280
 Nuclear submarines have nuclear reactors. Nuclear reactors need people to run them 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.300
 and so what do you do, if you are the Royal Navy and you have to 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.440
 people have to run your nuclear reactors? 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.260
 Well, you are building a nuclear reactor in the basement 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:46.700
 of a 17th century building just a few miles from the center of London. 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.100
 Seriously, exactly here, 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.289
 somewhere in this complex, somewhere in the basement of this, the King William building, 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:57.100
 was a working nuclear reactor for many years, from 1963 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.109
 until the mid-90s. At that time Greenwich called itself a nuclear-free 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.360
 area. This area was specially exempted. 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.700
 And why was there no protest? Well, first of all 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.930
 not many people knew about it. The Royal Navy is pretty good in operational safety 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.909
 and secondly, well despite the fact that the word "nuclear reactor" is very scary, 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.509
 it was only a small reactor. It produced 10 kilowatts that is enough to the 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.030
 about five kettles to turn. I mean the amount of fuel 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.200
 that it produced are actually quite small. There would never be a chance 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.509
 been on a Chernobyl here. But good if Thor was invaded ... 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.509
 I do not know what Thor did, I-- I did not see the movie. 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.600
 If Thor would have invaded a few decades earlier, who knows? 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.400
 There might have been a little more radioactivity, his hammer 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.929
 I - as I said, I have not seen the film, so I do not know what happened. 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.560
 This is the first videos sent by things that you have submitted. Thank you very much 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.180
 for David and Olly who tipped me over the reactor in the middle of Greenwich. 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.180
