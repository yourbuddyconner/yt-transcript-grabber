00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.509
 I'm in the computer history museum in California Mountain View, 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:07.279
 and among all the thousands of artifacts there is also this: 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:09.220
 A teardrop tea kettle. 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.730
 The best known tea kettle in the world. 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.980
 It's called the Utah kettle and you've certainly seen it, 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.129
 although you may not be aware of it. 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.770
 Or at least its digital version. 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.820
 In the old screensaver of Windows Pipes 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.480
 occasionally instead of a joint 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.940
 discovered a kettle. 

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.940
 This kettle. 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.070
 We find it in the background of the Simpsons episode of ninety years 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.039
 and in several Pixar movies. 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:30.670
 It's a joke among animators 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.780
 because it is the first realistic, complex object, 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.539
 which was widely used in computer graphics. 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.670
 In 1974, scientist Martin Newell of Utah University needed 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.300
 simple object to test the algorithm he proposed. 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.639
 The story says he gave his wife a cup of tea - 

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:53.149
 Newell was born in Britain, so tea - 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.260
 and she suggested she model a teapot. 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.949
 And that was ideal. 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.909
 It has a concave and convex surface. 

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:00.879
 He can throw a shadow on himself, 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:04.460
 which is a problem that some algorithms have to solve the problem. 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.270
 It is instantly recognizable; 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.600
 you can tell if the tea kettle looks like a teapot, 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.840
 or if something went wrong while processing. 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.360
 And you do not have to texture it to look good. 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.310
 As long as it is simple, light and 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:18.159
 well ... looks like a tea kettle. 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.370
 But at the same time it is not too complicated. In the seventies 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.640
 computer graphics included a lot of manual work. 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.299
 Newell sketched a pot of millimeter paper 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:28.510
 and then manually enrolled the resulting coordinates. 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.690
 And here's something I really like on this kettle: 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.079
 in the forty years of what its digital version exists, 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.330
 details have forgotten her. 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.540
 It is said to have been used so often for early graphic experiments, 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.399
 that some people memorized all of her data 

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:43.270
 and simply wrote them when they needed it. 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.330
 Can I find a reliable source for this? 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.390
 Of course not, 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:46.810
 but it's a great story. 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.159
 At some point, this kettle squeezed a little, 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.869
 some people claim that due to old displays with rectangular pixels, 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.830
 and some say it's just because it looked better. 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.850
 It is a remnant of the digital era that has urban legends around it, 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.340
 whether they are true or not, 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.430
 here is the canonical version of this kettle: 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.550
 a digital object that has been copied and copied to all branches of modern culture. 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:14.940
 Virtually billions of people have seen - not this kettle - 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.760
 but its version, which can be described by page numbers. 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.050
 Thanks to the Museum of Computer History in Mountain View, California! 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.551
 Look into the label for a link to their site and the amazing exhibitions they have here.
