00:00:06.435 --> 00:00:10.646
 Behind me is DRIU, a training unit for repairing damage. 

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:13.816
 It's a big metal box that we flood. 

00:00:13.935 --> 00:00:15.347
 It's a replica of a ship. 

00:00:15.443 --> 00:00:21.782
 The inside is a copy of most British Royal Navy ships. 

00:00:21.986 --> 00:00:26.214
 It is mainly used for the repair of damaged ship. 

00:00:30.213 --> 00:00:33.060
 This is serious. I... 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.745
 We'll have to try to repair some holes in the ship. 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.083
 It scares me a little. 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.413
 It's water at normal temperature. We'll be freezing. 

00:00:43.509 --> 00:00:46.487
 We have 4 sections divided into three decks. 

00:00:46.607 --> 00:00:52.032
 We have total control over the water level, the amount of smoke and lighting. 

00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:56.428
 We can simulate pipe damage, holes in the deck and in bulkheads ... 

00:00:56.517 --> 00:01:00.369
 We can rotate the unit up to 15 degrees. 

00:01:00.704 --> 00:01:05.201
 And at different speeds to simulate different weather. 

00:01:05.261 --> 00:01:08.347
 Beginners can only shoot 5 degrees. 

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:10.279
 It will seem a lot to them. 

00:01:10.471 --> 00:01:16.015
 The trained crew would shoot at 15 degrees to make it harder for them. 

00:01:16.416 --> 00:01:19.956
 "A detected torpedo detected." 

00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:25.710
 You cow! 

00:01:28.264 --> 00:01:33.048
 The first is a breakthrough with a pressure of 8.2 bar. 

00:01:33.132 --> 00:01:36.123
 It points directly to us and we have to resolve it first. 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.228
 You feel the pressure from two meters. 

00:01:38.347 --> 00:01:40.764
 There is air and water on you. 

00:01:40.973 --> 00:01:46.523
 As I headed for my waist bag, I did not realize how much it felt. 

00:01:55.632 --> 00:01:59.556
 The first hit, Zulu One, will consist of a smaller crack in the deck 

00:01:59.723 --> 00:02:02.253
 and multiple cracks in the side of the ship. 

00:02:02.373 --> 00:02:06.081
 Both of them are clogged with soft wood wedges. 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:09.514
 Here he pushes me ... who actually clogged this one? 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.524
 - It's me. - You? 

00:02:11.615 --> 00:02:15.289
 I tried it, but I could not find the crack. 

00:02:15.514 --> 00:02:17.868
 It was very tricky. 

00:02:18.012 --> 00:02:20.155
 When I sank for the first time, I did not find it either. 

00:02:20.308 --> 00:02:23.079
 I know it was right between your legs. 

00:02:23.174 --> 00:02:25.409
 Even for God, I could not get the wedge there. 

00:02:25.524 --> 00:02:28.528
 I tried to stay optimistic. 

00:02:28.662 --> 00:02:30.289
 But it did not help much. 

00:02:30.562 --> 00:02:33.701
 Anyone who wants to serve on a Royal Navy ship, 

00:02:33.796 --> 00:02:36.629
 must complete DRIU training. 

00:02:36.801 --> 00:02:40.835
 They should be able to enter the flooded part of the ship 

00:02:41.112 --> 00:02:43.485
 and temporarily stop water pickup. 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.213
 They should be familiar with the equipment, with the possibility of permanent repairs 

00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:51.002
 and should be able to drain water. 

00:02:51.624 --> 00:02:53.328
 This is a multiple crack. 

00:02:54.112 --> 00:02:56.993
 You spent a lot of time up there. It was a lot of work. 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.256
 A lot of dangling. 

00:02:58.351 --> 00:03:01.294
 But as the water rolls in, they can not find the cracks, 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.820
 because the level is above them. 

00:03:04.662 --> 00:03:06.500
 What did you do? 

00:03:06.595 --> 00:03:08.413
 I held it. 

00:03:08.547 --> 00:03:11.356
 You had to use all his weight. 

00:03:11.473 --> 00:03:14.343
 Do you see how my legs started to go to the side? 

00:03:14.563 --> 00:03:17.262
 I could not get them back. 

00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:22.252
 This pressure resembles what you would experience several decks under the surface. 

00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:25.654
 Water pressure is relatively realistic. 

00:03:25.855 --> 00:03:28.879
 In some cases, the water is pumped, 

00:03:28.994 --> 00:03:34.807
 this simulates a high-pressure crack or damage to water distribution. 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:36.051
 Wedge! 

00:03:37.056 --> 00:03:40.386
 Respect Tom for cutting the wedge. 

00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:42.836
 - In the crisis situation ... - I forgot it. 

00:03:42.922 --> 00:03:46.559
 - "She does not fit in!" - "Yeah, we can do it." 

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:56.874
 Second hit. You will see an 8 cm wide crack. 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.831
 It will be poorly accessible. Appears behind the locker. 

00:04:00.884 --> 00:04:03.668
 So someone will have to get into the cabin 

00:04:03.745 --> 00:04:07.075
 and the rest of the team will hold him and look for wedges. 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.912
 "Detected torpedo triggered. 

00:04:21.974 --> 00:04:26.773
 Several people are watching and influencing the crane. 

00:04:26.907 --> 00:04:31.104
 They have total control over the water level. 

00:04:31.244 --> 00:04:35.851
 If you do well and want to make it harder, it will increase it. 

00:04:36.005 --> 00:04:38.909
 If they want to be worthy, the level will decrease. 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.019
 In case of emergency, they can quickly drain the water. 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:47.713
 They can communicate directly with the head unit on the bridge. 

00:04:47.885 --> 00:04:51.191
 The supervisor can turn on and off accidents, 

00:04:51.287 --> 00:04:55.703
 controls the lights, the smoke and the tilt of the unit. 

00:04:55.818 --> 00:04:58.861
 The water is similar to the pool. We charm her. 

00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:01.818
 It is stored directly below the unit. 

00:05:01.914 --> 00:05:06.349
 We pump her to the side of the tank before training. 

00:05:07.588 --> 00:05:08.756
 This wardrobe... 

00:05:09.426 --> 00:05:11.072
 We all tried. 

00:05:11.182 --> 00:05:13.268
 I still have water in my ears. 

00:05:13.531 --> 00:05:14.660
 Just the power ... 

00:05:14.794 --> 00:05:19.287
 I put my head there like this, so the water did not flow into my face. 

00:05:19.531 --> 00:05:23.110
 - But I did not see anything. The wedges were still sliding sideways. 

00:05:23.517 --> 00:05:25.813
 Most of the time I just breathed water. 

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.282
 So even though I had wedges in the right place, 

00:05:28.397 --> 00:05:30.847
 I had to leave because I forgot to breathe. 

00:05:30.962 --> 00:05:32.220
 But you did it. 

00:05:32.354 --> 00:05:35.454
 - Finally, yeah. - How did you do that? 

00:05:35.579 --> 00:05:38.220
 Just put the wedges on the left side of the hole 

00:05:38.406 --> 00:05:40.229
 and then pushing them upstream. 

00:05:40.282 --> 00:05:42.253
 So such an arrow formation. 

00:05:42.387 --> 00:05:44.689
 Two on the side and one in the middle. 

00:05:44.804 --> 00:05:46.660
 He stuck him there and stumbled. 

00:05:46.775 --> 00:05:50.660
 Those wedges gave me exactly in such a formation 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:52.856
 and then I got a hammer ... 

00:05:52.971 --> 00:05:54.521
 It worked. 

00:05:56.043 --> 00:06:00.124
 We are looking for material to better crack clogging. 

00:06:00.631 --> 00:06:04.880
 A sandwich composed of rubber, steel and wood is laid on board. 

00:06:05.076 --> 00:06:07.004
 This is an important part of the training. 

00:06:07.176 --> 00:06:12.033
 The flooded sections of the ship are shifting to maneuverability and stability. 

00:06:12.157 --> 00:06:15.143
 Many flooded sections can sink the ship. 

00:06:15.406 --> 00:06:19.133
 There would also be a lot of equipment, 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.483
 which would directly affect combat effectiveness. 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:28.436
 During the war, we must also save the material that will allow us to fight. 

00:06:29.694 --> 00:06:35.699
 During peace, we are just trying to ensure stability so the ship sails. 

00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:39.556
 In controlled simulator conditions 

00:06:39.651 --> 00:06:43.881
 we four needed five attempts to close the opening behind the cabinet. 

00:06:44.383 --> 00:06:48.996
 But professionals can fix it in five minutes. 

00:06:49.125 --> 00:06:50.828
 It took us 20 minutes. 

00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:53.661
 Besides, it was the easiest difficulty. 

00:06:58.235 --> 00:07:01.355
 Previously, I saw rookie training there. 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:05.355
 These newcomers worked together. 

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:08.627
 They knew what to do. We were chaotic. 

00:07:08.713 --> 00:07:11.661
 - They worked together. - We forgot the hammer at one point. 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:13.455
 What are we? 

00:07:13.512 --> 00:07:14.929
 But we did it. 

00:07:15.044 --> 00:07:18.082
 They gave us the hammers and we stood up. 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:28.594
