00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
This is a Soviet T34 battle tank

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:04.860
Well, okay...

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.060
admittedly it's now a decommissioned hunk of metal.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:08.460
It was bought from the Czech army

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.920
after the collapse of the Soviet Union

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:11.360
used for some filming --

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.800
a Shakespeare play of all things --

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.460
and then bought by a local resident, here in Bermondsey

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.460
And it's been installed on this bit of waste ground

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.580
and painted ridiculous colors ever since.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.060
But that's not what I'm actually here to talk about,

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.060
I'm here to talk about something a little more general.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.860
Specifically something that makes every British tank

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.120
better than every other tank, and every other fighthing machine

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.340
in the world.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.760
Now I realise that's a slightly Jeremy Clarkson-ish thing to say,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.120
so let me explain:

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.140
British tanks all have something called a BV:

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.580
a boiling vessel.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.680
Technically it's a CV or a cooking vessel now,

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.400
but what it is: it's a square thing,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.880
about that big,

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.700
that you put water in

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.700
and you turn it on and it heats the water up

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.740
...it's a kettle.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.160
Basically, it is a kettle

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.740
and all British tanks and all British fighting machines

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:58.860
have one of these

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.900
and what it means,

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.520
is that British tank crews

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.040
can have tea whenever they like.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.600
And to me,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.420
never mind your caterpillar tracks

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.380
and your all-terrain

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.140
and your range finders

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.480
and your weaponry

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.140
never mind all that.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.220
To me: the ability to have tea when ever you would like

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.000
makes the British tank

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.620
every other tank

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:19.660
in the world!

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:22.220
You can fight that one out in the comments.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.600
Anyway, that is something you've might not have known.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
