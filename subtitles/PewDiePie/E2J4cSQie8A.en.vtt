 Why is that? Ridiculous Jesus Christ... 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.040
 I think if I should eat the last piece of pizza now, or save it later, when I am. 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.400
 😀😀😀 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.420
 This is when THAT Meme is seen from everything I have seen. 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.380
 You see stupid screenshots 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.980
 Correct? 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.520
 Hey.. Should I still eat it now? 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.820
 But.. if I eat now... 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.740
 This will be hot and delicious* thinking intensified 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.340
 I can save it for later and 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.400
 .. but if I eat later 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.340
 Then it won't taste as good. 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.860
 But I am not really hungry now. 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.740
 Oh my god. Oh, my goodness, it looks like I have failed this challenge. 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.780

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.000
 How am I Brad? 😀😀😀 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:48.520
 BRAD 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.280
 Who is Brad who told me about G-fuel 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.380
 He has always wanted to sponsor G-fuel for so long. 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.960
 Eh. And its in COMES PEWDIEPIE! 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.760
 aYEEE &lt;input code "PEWDIEPIE" 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.240
 You didn't get any G-FUEL, Brad. 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:16.320
 I am tired of such subtitles. Sorry. Sending for help and g fuel 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.570

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.920
 Oh, my god is 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.810
 In clay. This is the cutest thing I have ever seen, fucking me. 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:40.740
 However, no one has warned her this 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:44.100
 serious. My budget is chatting 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:46.000
 The room is so good. 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.510
 Why do you want to cry before everything. 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.390
 Everyone is pointing out how she sounds like 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.010
 The same is true for car alarms. Therefore, get 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.670
 The guy who keeps moving forward. How are you. do not 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:03.840
 care. Let's go ahead. 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.420
 I can say this is only once 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.830
 Before I go 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.110
 Yes, brother. 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.040
 Thank you. one day 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.690
 just now. 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.910
 Yes 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.070
 Aha, it’s so sad. 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.120
 We can sound like a car alarm. This actually 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.500
 sad. 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.110
 Wow. Wow. What is free. 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.950
 It is endless. 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.640
 Ok. I am beautiful. 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.500
 Is there a twin or I am stupid? I can't tell. 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:54.680
 No no no no. In the evening, it said it was a mirror. 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:57.580
 It is like a mirror. It is like a mirror 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.950
 trick. I do not know. I am very smart 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:03.220
 So their way is like a mirror. I know, if you 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.190
 Hearing this, but it is the basic for him to do so. That is 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:08.380
 There is nothing like him or something like that. 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.100
 A good joke is ok. I am not really doing this too well. 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.920
 This challenge. This seems to be the time 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.120
 Go if you like it. boy 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.500

 High crime rate is brighter 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:26.630
 Hello there. 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.620
 In order to be fair, Brad you just entered the code PEWDIEPIE 

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:31.090
 You will get a 30% discount. 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.480
 This is a great deal. This is a good 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.390
 response. Not saying that there are n minutes of higher words 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:40.340
 Challenge, but obvious 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.890
 The pain has not yet receded. 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.440
 And the doctor provided a suggestion. Let's go to the hospital. 

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.980
 this is 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:52.140
 unbelievable. It looks a lot like a person now. 

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:55.160
 Serum comes from the testes. 

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:58.780
 Its face, we all have to go through the end 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.860
 Grow up and become a man. What does he have to do. 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.960
 I'm confused. 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.460
 This is my children. One day, at 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:08.470
 California. God. One or two weeks 

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.640
 In California. Let's get up. I hope you have a great day. 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.480
 Row. This is my voice. 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:16.540
 Two years in California. 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.290

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.160
 Yes. 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:26.830
 I mean no. That's too bad. Hit it. 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.490
 I think this is just funny. But you have seen the reference, I don't show it 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.820
 reference. Hey, buddy I. 

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.830
 You have a boyfriend. Oh

 This is sad or false. Wow. true. have to

 It’s a genius that speaks for itself. 

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:48.520
 Drink and find 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.350
 Correct. Sorry. What are you talking about?

 Drink the fountain. Take one. 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:58.850
 Ok. 

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.490
 I like the laughter of gorillas. Oh, it's actually working. 

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:18.030
 This is what I said. 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:22.230
 Both the means and ticktock were invented 

00:07:22.590 --> 00:07:25.290
 Keep human development, not 

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.840
 Come up with useful ideas, 

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:30.840
 Advance humanity forward. Instead, we are here. 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.010
 This kind of thing 

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:37.410
 For the sake of the means. it is good. listen 

00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:40.410
 My guy you are going to put my tail tin foil hat means 

00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:43.160
 Created by an alien 

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.040
 It sounds crazy. 

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.640
 It was established to stop progress 

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:52.640
 Human beings, aliens living far away 

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.580
 Close Dallas, the galaxy is far and far away 

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:58.250
 Time to reach us and the aggressor. 

00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:01.100
 At this time, they arrived at us us 

00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.980
 Technology is not yet, because at all of us advanced us 

00:08:03.980 --> 00:08:06.560
 Made a one billion year old method of making 

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.430
 think about it. There is also a sand world. 

00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.420
 The file is called. So let's do it. I 

00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:21.130

 So much to watch. 

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.320
 I saw that you are 

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:42.860
 Home leaves. What are you, I am 57000 

00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:45.470
 subscriber. Jay Chou is the right to all of this. 

00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:48.970
 I became famous for some bead videos. I 

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.930

 Fuck me, what should I do and what I do. 

00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.060
 I am sorry. I am sorry. I subscribe to my other seven accounts. 

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.930

 I will always check. 

00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.340
 I have seen this. No. 

00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.280
 Hey. See who found my confession and pity. 

00:09:19.380 --> 00:09:21.520
 They beat you like an elf for the first time. 

00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:24.920
 u like to eat beans? u know what PAC stands for? 

00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.040
 The controller who plans and controls his own programs. 

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.060
 The whole thing is a metaphor. He thinks he is 

00:09:31.070 --> 00:09:33.620
 Have free will, but in fact he is trapped in the maze 

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:34.940
 In a system. 

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.850
 All he can do is consume. What he pursues 

00:09:37.850 --> 00:09:40.820
 The demon is probably just in his own 

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.080
 mind. 

00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:44.880
 He has a girlfriend, in a club, line. 

00:09:45.690 --> 00:09:46.470
呃 毫米 mm. 

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:49.670
 You better believe that you will push the boy to swim. You will get 

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:52.640
 With so many pushes you can make a fool out of the cat. you can 

00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.520
 The one that constitutes a whole fashion garment production line out of the cat 

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.100
 So much to get you started. It either hits or misses. 

00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.800
 There, it is. There, it is everywhere. The 

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.700
 Car alarm. 

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.630
 I don't care what people will do. 

00:10:13.630 --> 00:10:16.490
 For his life, but crying 

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.430
 Make. I was irritated by you. 

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.370
 Scared. 

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.460
 This is the worst readout noise I have ever heard. 

00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:29.770
