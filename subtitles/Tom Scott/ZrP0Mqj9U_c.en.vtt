00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160
This is not an artificial swimming pool,

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:05.090
and it's not filled with
chlorinated, treated water.

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.070
This is a natural spring
in Weeki Wachee, Florida.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.440
And it's at the top of a
massive system of caverns,

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.520
where the Weeki Wachee River surfaces.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.680
Hundreds of millions of litres of water

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.230
forcing its way out the ground every day.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.790
But while the spring might be natural,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.430
what's going on under the
surface definitely isn't.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.020
It's created by humans,
because for more than 70 years,

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.160
there's been a mermaid show here.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.030
- Toughest part of the job,
I definitely think, is training.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:33.260
Took me about six months
to swim my first show.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.000
Once you get hired,
you get scuba certified

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.990
and then you can start on the hose,
which --

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.790
that's the process
that takes the longest.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.570
Learning how to breathe and
be comfortable down there.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.810
It takes a lot of breath control
and building your lungs.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.620
Teaching your lungs and stretching them
and getting them used to holding the air.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.670
The longest we hold our breath here
is the Ferris wheel.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.990
That's when we hold each other
and we spin around.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.550
The water is 74.2Â° year-round.
It's very cold being in there.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.450
- We have approximately
20-25 young women on staff

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.410
who perform as mermaids.

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.210
We also have about three or four gentlemen

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:09.010
that play the role of the prince
in our version of The Little Mermaid.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.950
- This place is the work
of a man called Newt Perry,

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.900
world class swimmer and swimming coach,

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.460
former diver for the U.S. Navy,
and consultant to Hollywood.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.570
He looked at this spring and thought,

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.390
"I could put a show on in there".

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.440
The first theatre had 18 seats,
but by the sixties,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.070
the ABC television network
had bought the place,

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.330
and built a theatre for 400.
And it was selling out.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.370
- Well, 117 million gallons of water

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.300
coming from a very tiny opening
at the bottom of the spring on a daily basis

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.620
will provide a current,
and it's about a 5mph current.

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.920
They're not swimming in a tank.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.140
There's so many different species of wildlife
that inhabit a Florida river, we get 'em all.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.567
Turtles, otters, the manatees
are always a favourite.

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:50.200
- The turtles love to get in the way,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.680
and they'll follow your tail around.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.960
We don't really have
snakes come that often.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.200
Every once in a while, blue moon.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.450
And then sometimes we'll get alligators.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.360
If they're in a range that's too close,

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.420
we'll get out of the water.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.871
- In the 60s, Weeki Wachee was a spectacular,
world-famous tourist attraction.

00:02:04.871 --> 00:02:08.260
But by the 90s, the consensus
was that is was a relic.

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:11.650
Dated and down on its luck, at least
compared to the shiny new theme parks

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.540
that Disney and Universal
were opening over in Orlando.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.050
In 2003, the New York Times
called this place "aging" and "faded".

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.400
But it turns out that once
something gets old enough,

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.035
with the right marketing, "outdated"
can become "retro". "Historic".

00:02:26.035 --> 00:02:28.020
- Weeki Wachee Springs
was a private company

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.980
all the way up until 2008,
when the state of Florida,

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.290
in an effort to help save it,
acquired the attraction.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.240
And not only did they acquire it

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.890
for the natural resource that
we have here, the spring,

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.490
the scrub habitat that
surrounds the spring,

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.740
but also because of the
cultural significance

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.337
of what the mermaids have meant
to Florida tourism for seven decades now.

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:54.160
- Weeki Watchee is never going to be
on same level as Walt Disney World.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.380
It couldn't be.

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.110
But the same day I'm here, the Florida state
tourist board have sent a crew to film.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.400
The last audition call for mermaids here
made the news around the world,

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.260
and the articles are sounding a lot more
positive than they did 15 years ago.

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.810
In the 21st century, Weeki Wachee
is becoming a bit of living history.

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.410
History that still has three shows a day.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:19.720
- Being a mermaid is the best job
anyone could ask for.

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.100
My favourite part of the job
is dealing with the kids

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.630
and making a difference in the community.

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:27.310
We do a lot of dealing with
Make-A-Wish programmes,

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.350
and these kids think that
you're really a mermaid

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.850
and they think that everything
you're doing is so magical.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.860
Just making such a
difference in their lives,

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.070
just by coming to work,

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.090
we're pretty lucky that we can do that.

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:39.270
- Thanks to all the team at
Weeki Wachee Springs State Park.

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:42.220
