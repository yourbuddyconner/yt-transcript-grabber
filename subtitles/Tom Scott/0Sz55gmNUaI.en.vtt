00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.210
 This is not a remote tropical island. 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.279
 I am inside, in a water park. 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.360
 This is the largest uninterrupted hall in the world. 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.829
 There are a number of larger ones, but they have pillars to stay upright. 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:17.939
 This is just one big roof. In terms of volume it is bigger 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.509
 then the assembly space of NASA. 

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:24.779
 The Palace of Westminster would fit in here, even twice. 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.460
 There would still be room for some water slides. 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.320
 Besides the slides and cabins - which you can rent at night - 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.660
 there is a guided balloon that takes you up to the roof. 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.370
 Or it can take 6 passengers for a flight in the hall. 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.800
 Those panels there: they let UV light through so that trees can grow, 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.870
 which means that the sun can burn you ... inside. 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.739
 But in the winter this space remains tropical warm. 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.500
 The amount of heating, cooling and water circulation that is needed is immense. 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.309
 There is no company that is building 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.390
 such a building could afford. It's just too expensive, 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.000
 they could never ask for enough income to cover the costs. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.840
 And yet I am here. 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.700
 That brings me to this question: 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.490
 What do you do with a discarded hall for airships? 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.270
 That is not a hypothetical question, that is what this is. 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.220
 Actually it was not really discarded, it was never used. 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.870
 This whole building is built on an old German airport, 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.000
 around the turn of the century, during the dot-com bubble. 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.140
 It was designed to store a huge cargo-carrying airship that was never built 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.720
 because the company went bankrupt a year later when the economy crashed. 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.280
 The investors lost their money, 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.930
 - It took 78 million euros to build this - 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.990
 it is certain that they have not earned that back. 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.470
 A Malaysian company bought the hangar for a bargain price, 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.320
 an amount that, in theory, can be earned back in decades. 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.590
 If you give it some attention and ask for entrance 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.320
 And maybe add some water slides. 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.740
 And the result is, strangely enough, the largest water park in the world 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.460
 and a fluke of our strange 21st century economy.
