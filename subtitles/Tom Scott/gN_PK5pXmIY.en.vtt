00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.620
 The internet is bullshit about the numbers of these toasters 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.589
 are actually minutes 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.440
 this is completely, altogether untrue, and I will now prove it. All these toasters are 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.910
 set to the second degree 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.690
 This is a cheap toaster, preferred by students everywhere 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.270
 It's not such a cheap toaster, preferred by people who just graduated from university 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.410
 and they thought, "I do not have to buy the cheapest toaster." 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.110
 And here's a little more expensive toaster, for people think that "it's being removed 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.080
 crumb tray "is a nice thing 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.180
 We also have an office toaster that I tapped from the neighboring office 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.679
 all of them are set to "2" and I guarantee that none of them will pop after just two minutes 

00:00:38.679 --> 00:00:43.949
 Why? Because the toasters do not have time chips. They are too cheap. 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:49.809
 What they have is a double metal plate. Two metal pieces, put back in the back, which are heated 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.300
 and expand at a different speed so that the plate slightly distorts. What we change by rotating the knob 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:00.249
 is how much the plate is distorted before turning on the device that makes the slices pop out 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:05.140
 Here we are not even close to 2 minutes. and at a different time in comparison 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.570
 with the other toasters 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.250
 Thinking that "2" means minutes is a bullshit. And here's another thing: it's not even 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.010
 logically. Because even 2 minutes, how would that help you? 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.310
 Still, you need to experiment with samples and mistakes to find out just how many minutes 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.000
 they need this kind of bread, and it certainly takes a lot more than 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.750
 we have them released now 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.770
 The office toaster? The one that is intended for businesses 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.570
 made to bake slices fast? No, there is no such thing. What we have here is 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.120
 four different toasters all set to "2" but none of them are popping up 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.170
 the second minute 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.170
 Someone on the Internet is wrong and you can now fix it 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:45.810
 Does anyone want a slicer? 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.450
 (This is not very baked) 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.070
 It's not even baked 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.730
 (it's terrible) 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.950
 What I'm glad about is that we're still shooting, and this toaster has not popped up yet. 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.530
 This is so different are the numbers of the toasters 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.250
 Now we are literally waiting for this toaster to pop out - Here! 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.870
 (Tom?) 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:03.500
 Yes? 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.890
 (I think it was 2 minutes) 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.200
 What, exactly? 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.809
 HA, well, maybe the expensive toaster has some kind of time chip. 

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:12.800
