00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
 "The eye of the dairy, the frog's thumb, the wool from the bat and the tongue of the dog." 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.220
 These are four of the ingredients used by the witch in Shakespeare's ... Scottish game. 

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:17.620
 You know, it's just that I'm just on the stage, between the backstage, here at the Warner Brothers Studio Tour. 

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:20.620
 It's a Harry Potter potion classroom. 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:27.980
 and say "on the stage" or "that name" (= Macbeth) is reported to be a big misfortune. 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.260
 It is said that Shakespeare used a real witch potion 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.480
 and the witch, who upset him so much, cursed his play, or his own, 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.380
 or, if you believe, anyone who pronounces it. 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.140
 And the result is that saying "M ... th" here is considered a very bad idea. 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:50.820
 But have you ever thought about it? It does not make much sense. 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.680
 Now I do not think the curse - it obviously makes no sense. 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.200
 But the witches would use the eye of the salamander. 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.380
 Witches, cunning people, as they were called, herbalists. 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.600
 They simply did not make the slices from which they cut something and tossed it into the potion. 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.600
 It does not make any sense. 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.940
 In fact, they used herbs and plants, and that's what the "eye of the milk" actually was. 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.280
 The "eye of the milk" is just a nickname for something far more harmless. 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.940
 And there are plenty of reasons why that could be said. The real reason is lost in time. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.280
 It could be a code word that keeps the charm within ... well, witchcraft. 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.640
 Or it could only be a matter of dialect, we do not know 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.920
 but what we know is that the "eye of the milk" was actually only mustard seed, 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.960
 Something warm and soothing to add to the healing broth. 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.560
 And that's something you did not have to know. 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.060
 MOVIES TO TEBE! 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.900
 Expelliarmus! 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.900
 ... Amateurs. 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.480
 I am currently browsing Harry Potter Studios 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.980
 and this is definitely a real stage, which means I would be very miserable ... when I say ... that 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.020
 ...Hi.
