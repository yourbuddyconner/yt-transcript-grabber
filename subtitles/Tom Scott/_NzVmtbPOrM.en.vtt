00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.600
 You can not see this pink. Not good. 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.419
 This camera can not capture it, 

00:00:04.419 --> 00:00:05.640
 YouTube can not save it, 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.759
 and the screen can not display it. 

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.160
 I am in the studio of artist Stuart Semple, 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.320
 and he has made what he calls the most rosy pink. 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.849
 I've been painting since I was five years old, 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.050
 and I've seen a lot of pink. 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.820
 And thousands and thousands of people have used the pink, 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.680
 and no one has said that they have seen a rosier pink. 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.039
 This stuff is really pink. 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.599
 I have made the pinkest pink, the greenest green, 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.380
 the most beautiful blue, and the yellowest yellow. 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.560
 I also made the most glittery natural glitter of the world 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.120
 and the matte, blackest art material in the world. 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:44.399
 About a year and a half ago, a company called Surrey Nanosystems 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.980
 announced that they had created Vantablack, 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.170
 that was this really great blacker-than-the-blackest-black black 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.720
 but they gave the exclusive rights to an artist named Anish Kapoor to use it, 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.769
 and that annoyed many artists, 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:58.480
 including me. 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.690
 So I released my rosiest pink. 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.879
 On the website I have posted a disclaimer, which states 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.780
 that you are not Anish Kapoor, that you are not associated with Anish Kapoor. 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.320
 Many people thought that was very funny 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:10.770
 and a lot of people bought the pink, 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.670
 unfortunately also Anish Kapoor, who managed to get it. 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.290
 and then he dipped his finger in it 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.250
 and put on Instagram that he had received the pink. 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.310
 It was great on one side and frustrating on the other when he did, 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.240
 because suddenly we got thousands and thousands of orders 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.270
 and that resulted in staying four weeks long to make pink paint 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.399
 and do nothing else. 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.260
 and it took our entire life. 

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.390
 There are all kinds of complicated and clever ways that computers can store colors, 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.560
 but by the time this video reaches your screen 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.040
 it is actually just a series of numbers that say how clear 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.829
 each of the red, green and blue pixels must be, 

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.880
 the small lights that make up your screen. 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.840
 And unless you have a really chic, expensive screen, 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.909
 these numbers run from 0 to 255 - that's eight ones in the binary system. 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.039
 0 means turn the pixel off, 255 means clear as it can go. 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.950
 That means that your screen can show around 16 million colors. 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.229
 But those are not all colors. 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.869
 And it is not this. 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.340
 Because if I pointed this camera at the sun, you would not be blinded. 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.430
 The numbers can not be over 255, I can not make your screen brighter than 100%. 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.800
 And if I aim the camera at something very dark, the number can not be below 0. 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.560
 I can not darken your screen than when it is turned off. 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.430
 In the same way, there are colors that are so intense 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.501
 that your screen can not display them, the pixels simply can not go red, green or blue enough. 

00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:35.459
 And this is one of those colors. 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.180
 There are huge libraries of pigments, 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.800
 organic, inorganic, synthetic, tempered, natural, 

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.379
 and they've been unearthed since the year zero. 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.989
 'Mummy brown' was made from crushed mummies. 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.160
 So there is a huge database of pigments that you can order. 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.450
 And you can play with them. 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.800
 I have made mixtures of these pigments and binders, 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.239
 something made, adjusted, and returned and got the connections well. 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:03.100
 So it is actually quite a complicated drink. 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.900
 In a few years time, technology will develop further. 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:09.879
 It is already possible to buy expensive equipment with a wider color range, 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:12.310
 and they would be able to display this pink. 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.940
 But in the meantime, I can try and simulate what it looks like here. 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:21.269
 In this recording, here, I digitally adjusted the saturation of this pink 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.380
 so it is not that intense. 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.300
 If I roll back the intensity now ... 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.620
 Imagine that change, but more. 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.129
 That is how pink this pink is. 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:33.420
 It is very pink. 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.320
 Thank you to Stuart Semple and the whole team of his studio: 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:40.940
 open the description for more about them, their pigments, and this pink. 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.120
 This is beautiful! 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:46.519
 I can not believe how luminous this is. 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.739
 I first thought "well, this does not do much, this is just some powder" 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.629
 but then it happened!
