00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:09.720
 We did it, we defeated the T-series, and *Felix's internal demons accounted for 69 million subscribers. 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.480
 I have never been so proud of it. 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.560
 I have never really felt respect for you, but you know that damn. 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.720
 But I just realized that I made a big mistake. 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.420
 Getting 69 million subscribers is not the most important number 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.100
 That's right 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.820
 I am talking about 69696969 subscribers. 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.440
 with 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.420
 Cooperation with Takeshi69 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.440
 Boom 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.680
 I am with two people. 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.240
 Boom~Boom~Boom~~~Boom 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.140
 I am leading this show. 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:42.620
 Do you know what 'persona' means? 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:43.640
 know 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.380
 What does 'persona' mean? 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.020
 * Tekashi 69 confuses fucking for a minute* UAHHHHH 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.660
 what does that mean? 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.140
 Silent silence. 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.580
 Like a beg... just like an act. 

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.660
 Just then we knew we had done it. 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.400
 That's how I can throw it away. 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.540
 &gt;&gt; PEWDIEPIE makes a loud sound 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.620
 Take the live T series. 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.580
 I do not care! (I am very concerned) 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.480
 6969696969 million subscribers 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.920
 Can we click on it? 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.780
 please. 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.260
 This will be the last thing I ask you. 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.760
 Let us jump into the meme guy now. 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:20.580
 &gt;&gt; NOTEBLOCKS releases LWIAY / YIAY INTRO SONG. 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.260
 When pewds reached 69 million and brought back the bonus meme on the same day 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.940
 You are a man. 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.840
 Or waman. 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.800
 Or no matter what you are, there is no discrimination. 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.100
 Cya, Marzia. :') 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.040
 When all 7.5 million users feel sad. 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.400
 So she got as much opinion as the subscriber, 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.120
 Oh, it looks like she is crying too! 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.720
 Ayy, uber eats. 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.280
 I am doing my duty in Bangladesh. 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.560
 Covering 3 km 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.940
 &gt;&gt; PEWDIEPIE BREAKS OFF AND LAUGHS 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.680
 Jesus Christ. 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.280
 Thank you, we have someone working inside! 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.200
 awesome! 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.200
 I have never been as proud as the Indian brothers. 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.560
 Many people are saying now 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.780
 It is like an "India Battle T Series" 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.480
 No! 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.520
 This has never happened. (maybe a little bit) 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.040
 This is what we need to do, we need more people to work from the inside 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.060
 It’s actually very interesting, a friend of mine sent me from London. 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.300
 This is not from reddit, this is a friend sent to me. 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.820
 I really appreciate Comic Sans, a great choice. 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.540
 This is how we win. 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.640
 Not finished yet 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.120
 We need to investigate, the T series. 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.000
 Pewdiepie audience: look at this 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.140
 Kowaiski, analysis. 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.220
 I should review and complete it. 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.200
 Although, brother... 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.020
 analysis 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:35.000
 The perfect balance of the memes will not 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.180
 Wow, I don't know what to say. I do not know what to say. 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.660
 The perfect sequel does not exist 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.220
 0 subscribers specal! 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.380
 1 Yas! 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.440
 Dane thanked his first subscriber... his grandmother. :) 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.480
 &gt;&gt; chuckle 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.160
 But where is a user specification? 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.160
 "At least he doesn't use robots." 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.720
 damn it. Maybe this is what we need to do. 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.800
 We need to expand this nine-year-old population. 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.780
 Everyone asks your grandma to subscribe... (rip headset user) right now 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.900
 If you haven't asked your grandma yet.. I really want to... this video won't continue. 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.880
 "I hope no one can open this joke." 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.660
 Yeah*呃* Someone is already joking, actually. 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.080
 But it is a good one - it is a good 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.920
 My sister crossed Pewds with a colored pencil and I hope he can see it! &lt;3 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.180
 * Kiss your fingers like an Italian chef * Beautiful 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:24.960
 This is incredible art, but all the places 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.020
 text? Where does all the information say "subscribe to PewDiePie"? what is this? 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.660
 Some kind of joke? Don't waste my time... 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.460
 Buy a small ad space god - * break into laughter* 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:39.460
 Seeing this is what I said. You bought a basic local newspaper and published it. 

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:44.120
 Help pewds become the first one to reach 69 - this is how we reach our goals. 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:48.440
 We worked together damn. I'm very proud. I am really proud. 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.580
 Made some "scorpion lasagna". This actually looks good. Honestly, it looks like a delicious bitch lasagna. 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:02.120
 (Please complete the rest of the work) When we reach 69 69 69 69 69 I personally have millions of subscribers 

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:06.810
 Offer this lasagna activity series smart guys say girls can't 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.709
 Gamers say girls can't be video games so they can't quote him 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.729
 I mean yes, just like you have to do it if you do something so obvious 

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:24.419
 These days, jokes, you can’t just say that girls are not gamers, it doesn’t matter. 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.570
 It’s a joke, so yes, you got congratulations. 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.470
 I figured out what you have to do, it makes no sense to turn me into a media. 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.050
 I am not afraid, please don't please please please turn me into me. 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.669
 When you saw the baby, I got dear and deleted other people from Spotify. 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.720
 Keep reloading it is not my fault just letting you know that this is not my fault 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:49.289
 It’s obviously not a gentleman who doesn’t care about your sandcastle. Ben Shapiro 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:54.360
 If we are the T series, I will bring back the bonus. I am right. 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:59.639
 Oh, it does come back, yes, can I say that I am a modest leader? 

00:04:59.639 --> 00:05:06.539
 Modest king, if you do this, I also remember 6-9 6-9 6-9 seconds nine us 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:17.370
 Take her to say no, not November, you are not you lost, you are not dear, so you have not 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:24.930
 Understand your stupid ball, you are stupid, you are just stupid one or two. 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:32.010
 Ok, if you can, this meme comment is epic to get Dr. Phil or LMS or Takeshi 69 or 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.349
 Almost anyone will have an epic trace of this tracer. 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:43.709
 And no one has a follower so anyone can choose to track production. 

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:50.429
 I feel so much to me, then I will become a trader, I am already a follower, this is the reason for women. 

00:05:50.429 --> 00:05:55.889
 The devil does not exist in the video game, God Satan, okay. 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:01.139
 I saw the picture I had to find this video just like Mr.'s series. Beast version 

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:05.279
 How much do they give you Simon? How much do they pay to do this? 

00:06:05.279 --> 00:06:10.769
 Simon pays you with tea service, I will double 

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:17.179
 Please Simon, we need more people to work inside the next name I am black and 

00:06:17.179 --> 00:06:24.299
 Hereby tell you this will not be good Peter Pan and by update 

00:06:24.299 --> 00:06:30.839
 Let him say at any time that N is just in the past, what does the word make him now? 

00:06:30.839 --> 00:06:39.899
 In the rich book I hope to see, the second season of panic PewDiePie will soon be fine. 

00:06:39.899 --> 00:06:45.059
 Tried a good try on the T series, but I am not seeing a potential format for it to drop 

00:06:45.059 --> 00:06:49.619
 On his Twitter felix there is a white screen behind him that might be a new memes 

00:06:49.619 --> 00:06:53.909
 The format unique to subreddit is that you are right, I did not expect 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:07:00.539
 When I released it, no, what did I do to upgrade perfectly? My God will never want 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:08.519
 Do another Conan O'Brien PD PI Ok, this is a good me, I am willing 

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:13.109
 Give it another chance to give you a shot and it is a crime. 

00:07:13.109 --> 00:07:18.149
 Because I am not my child's subscriber PewDiePie because he needs our help. 

00:07:18.149 --> 00:07:23.159
 Remove the T series once from YouTube and for everyone it seems to be T 

00:07:23.159 --> 00:07:28.499
 Series and Satan reached an agreement to subscribe so smashed, subscribe 

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:33.539
 The button rings the notification bell and sprints good news for PewDiePie 

00:07:33.539 --> 00:07:39.189
 Will continue to be the first. If we succeed, I will forgive you all. 

00:07:39.189 --> 00:07:44.259
 Sin, I want to bless valincia and Anisha 

00:07:44.259 --> 00:07:51.279
 Dragging and sending their greetings, Jesus joined the team, now we have no way 

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:57.310
 Losing the road to conquering people, a legendary world alliance 

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:04.270
 This is great, everyone works together and makes one 

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.199
 Part of them is part of it is not important. If you are a loser, I will never care. 

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:11.979
 Leave your computer, but what have you done now? 

00:08:11.979 --> 00:08:16.330
 Finally have a chance to do something meaningful God damn 

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:20.199
 I found a computer Google account that I worked with and I logged in, so I did it. 

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:24.340
 One person’s help and smashed Mr. transcript you didn’t play 

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:29.500
 Bell button, what are you thinking about? I should be grateful now. 

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:50.620
 Right, I’ve done it, wait, what Romania’s wow, I don’t know them. 

00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:56.949
 Romanian tapes are crazy for everyone. This is a very proud absolute medal. 

00:08:56.949 --> 00:09:02.920
 Thank you, I think I think we and the doctor. If you, Phil needs to feel each other 

00:09:02.920 --> 00:09:06.370
 Do you understand what I mean? Look at PewDiePie, am I not? 

00:09:06.370 --> 00:09:12.220
 I won't judge, but you can give it to him, so he can stay in the first place and you are second. 

00:09:12.220 --> 00:09:16.899
 The person who said this to me, Lord, then the subscription is no longer 

00:09:16.899 --> 00:09:22.300
 That's hard, really not so hard. It looks like a tag to play with oh tags. 

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:26.490
 These days are another child, my god is strange. 

00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:32.010
 Why mark you can't just walk around and steal books 

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:42.310
 I hope that I see that is great. How do you know that she is white? We have created history. 

00:09:42.310 --> 00:09:47.480
 69 million you are damn we did but have not finished yet 

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:52.040
 We are so close, damn, I am too close, can taste it, go there and tell you 

00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.720
 Grandma, do your best, thank you for watching this video, thank you all. 

00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.560
 Memes and thank everyone for the amazing support, but the most important thing is thank you 

00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.880
 You have 69 million users of your job 

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:21.110
 So here is okay, okay, go ahead, outro, please.
