00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.340
 Brother Dobber.! 

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.920
 If you love paste, and love videos of landfills .. I have wonderful news for you! 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:17.400
 There is an abundance ... Putty paste on Lucas and Marcos ... Putty paste on a pizza man ..... Mold paste on the granule 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.580
 Mold putty on my brother's car 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.400
 Mold the paste on the granule again 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.140
 In the hot tub Hmmmmm mud dump on the little sister 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.540
 The mud mold on a cop develops into a problem .... The Dover Brothers are my favorite channel for the putty paste 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.880
 They really know how to make a putty mold at the top 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.000
 But what many do not appreciate for the Dover brothers is their wonderful craft 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.629
 And their art 

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:49.080
 In music. ðŸŽµ I will sneak through placing my feet in this chat 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:56.560
 ðŸŽµ You already want more, and God gave me everything for those who study 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.860
 Sixty million views, huh? 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.720
 It's 60 million 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:03.680
 60 million 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:11.120
 Sixty million mshahada, I want 60 million watch this .... * Explosion * If you are not afraid, hit it like you do not care about ðŸŽµ 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.020
 ðŸŽµ You do not bother ... hit it ðŸŽµ 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.900
 ðŸŽµIf you know that you ðŸŽµ guys, welcome from the future here 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.980
 Just want to tell you that today you can get a live broadcast panel for $ 99 instead of 

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:27.660
 149 Wow it's a fantastic deal. I love my .. I think it's a great device 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:34.300
 You can basically select any application or function such as OBS, which you used to record on this thing 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.080
 If you are broadcasting live you will have one of these and their own high capacity so that you can literally put anything in them 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.540
 If you want to open an application if you want to use the audio panel 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.700
 It's really really fantastic I would definitely recommend it and are sensitive in this offer your link in the description 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:54.940
 Well, continue with the video. Now, if you are nine years old, you can tell the Dubbers Brothers 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:02:03.200
 A little younger here. If you go in the comments say you said the word curse. I am seven years old. This is very irresponsible 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.820
 I did not say a cursed word in my own district, and a nine-year-old Republican 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:08.710
 thank you 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:15.920
 But what I find interesting about the Dobbers videos is their mold ... and their attention to detail 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.860
 In the mold because many people falsify their dumps 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.320
 But not the Dup brothers. They're beyond that know how to do a great coup 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:32.340
 Without lasting with real reactions and real feelings and you really really will feel this 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.320
 This one called the Mold Mom wake up in the ocean now. We will bring it back ready. Three Two One 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:44.320
 With twins and do fuck. Why do we do this to our mother? . This is the best mold ever 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:47.360
 They do not lie. This is my favorite favorite of all time 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:57.440
 They came up with this strange idea that they would take the hotel's rank 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.980
 While the mother sleeps, she is clearly asleep and may have been numb 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.760
 I'm sure m like that .. I say they will pull this ranking Oh what? Well, it looks like it'll fall away oh this was imminent you guys 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:13.220
 They decided to take this rank out into the ocean 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.180
 How can you ask how they brought this to that remote place? 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.640
 Indoor corridor, do not worry because they do not show that hehehehee 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.120
 What ! 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.380
 The video is about five minutes in a painful attempt to get this ranking outside the Hehehe hotel 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.000
 They steal the rank of a hotel 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.900
 The father really tries to really pull this 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.980
 Abe I want some views How will they use the rank in the elevator? I 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:00.020
 I can not believe she is still asleep. This is incredible. They pulled it all the way from the hotel to the seat 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.460
 Oh oh god 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.800
 Are we still here? .... ðŸŽµ 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.100
 ðŸŽµ Just for me 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.540
 ðŸŽµ Night ðŸŽµ 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.780
 I can feel my feet 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:17.840
 ðŸŽµ care ... even my fingers ðŸŽµ 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.500
 ðŸŽµ The body has died ðŸŽµ 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.320
 ðŸŽµ comrades have mato ðŸŽµ 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.440
 ðŸŽµ The nose does not stop ðŸŽµ 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.240
 ðŸŽµ It seems like the pain is still there 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.600
 How I got there I have no idea 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.300
 Do not you just hate when you fall asleep in a bedroom, a hotel and .....? 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.520
 Your children carry you through the corridor with your rank, 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.300
 Learn to be frank 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.340
 I knew it was a mold 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.180
 - Oh really ? - What ? 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:50.580
 What ? Oh really ? 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.580
 I knew that 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.040
 If the boy is turned over! 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.180
 I really knew it was a mold (the classic double trick) I've taken this step often 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.740
 We are really sorry as we did not mean harm. Have you laughed? 

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.060
 -What is that? .. -I do not know 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.600
 Laughter was on you. Dobra and not me nor Malarki, wait what? 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.720
 Double mold 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.180
 What just happened? I have seen a better representation on the adult sites of Yale Christ 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.940
 But the confusing thing about it is that they always turn around 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:36.560
 everybody . But no one seems to understand when it's real and when it's fake 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:42.600
 You have all this surprise of this person and everyone says ... what? 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.460
 She is the she is she Hahaha 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:49.200
 What are his speeches? 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:50.640
 You guys are not funny 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:55.720
 Yes, another mold has stopped 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:03.720
 Malmer, he shouted? So it seems that he lost his dog, ... yeah, I just run the lights 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:10.440
 My dog â€‹â€‹Romeo and loved it. It's like a god, I do not know 

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:13.700
 He says that the dog has been gone forever 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:20.160
 Romeo Maine I love him. As if it were my father. It was like my son, who I did not notice. Unfortunately 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.980
 He's dead now 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:32.400
 I do not know maybe they still represent. I do not know. I am very confused by this video. They go with him everywhere 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:36.820
 They even get some of the security men involved 

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:45.640
 Yes, keep the lights on and I'll start reporting the cameras about you, and wake up the next day 

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:50.420
 I will warn you guys about this next passage. It's very humiliating 

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:52.240
 here we are 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:55.820
 I really feel sorry for Cyrus who has been communicating with us all night 

00:06:55.980 --> 00:07:00.980
 But we could not find him and the security guard was outside until 5:00 am 

00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:07.340
 Haha was a security guard outside until 5 am looking for their dog. right Now. We just will 

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.340
 Will look inside 

00:07:11.820 --> 00:07:17.440
 - Oh there it is! - Oh, it 's at the pool house 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.360
 Romeo 

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.540
 What is he doing there? 

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.980
 Romeowoo 

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:34.640
 Well, they actually found him hiding his dog? - I do not understand it. I am very confused 

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:41.120
 I am very confused. It is the same with this video this is the best marriage application in the world 

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.220
 You like, obviously this will be a kind of stupid dumps, right? 

00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.000
 - what are you doing ? - I love you 

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:50.160
 Give me a kiss give me a kiss .. 

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:52.440
 You are the most wonderful in the world 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:53.540
 You are the girl of my dreams 

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:59.640
 I want to protect you always. I want to protect you and keep you comfortable 

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:01.720
 I want to give you the world 

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:04.520
 I want to make you happy every day 

00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:07.780
 If they have a dron fly up 

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:22.120
 Holds the ring .. The best request for hand marriage in the world, it is a fact like what is real and what is fake? 

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.920
 I do not understand. I need the Debra brothers 

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:33.360
 Best marriage application in the world. We had a dron fly with the ring 

00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.240
 I love you .. Why do not I hear you? 

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:44.100
 I always love you. I always want to make you feel comfortable and I want to give you the world 

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:53.160
 * Real voice * 

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:56.320
 I just love how they understand each other. This 

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.380
 This is the theme Hua 

00:09:01.400 --> 00:09:05.520
 I hope we hope to be fine. I mean, you know, I will not lie though young 

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:13.220
 Photographic photography and leadership is a difficult process. So be sure not to filming or sending text messages any of these 

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:17.360
 But because we are in harmony ... we will keep the recording of the film 

00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:22.460
 Do not imagine the phoenix and lead you guys 

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:28.940
 Leading to the filming of a cockroach with driving. Oh, my God Cyrus is talking to me now 

00:09:29.340 --> 00:09:32.100
 your phone 

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:41.560
 You may have already watched this video, it's another 

00:09:42.259 --> 00:09:45.519
 Classic Dup brothers have this 

00:09:46.459 --> 00:09:52.749
 They have these extensive arrangements of tools and they have to guess which one is real and which 

00:09:53.269 --> 00:09:58.599
 One fake. The cold is not real because it is metal. Oh 

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:07.000
 You mean like the way you can just raise it and tell some of them are the chocolate that is the correct chocolate 

00:10:12.050 --> 00:10:14.050
 This one is too heavy 

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:22.089
 This is real white which is cool, this is my own 

00:10:23.899 --> 00:10:27.669
 Lot I mean they're all the same weight here - that's right 

00:10:27.829 --> 00:10:32.019
 Every person weighs himself like a metal. Everyone knows this 

00:10:32.569 --> 00:10:39.819
 They're all almost the same way. Pretty much here. Our video where they obviously pour mud on a girlfriend 

00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:42.759
 I love seeing the mud on my girlfriends 

00:10:45.370 --> 00:10:49.139
 Hey, what's up, I'm 

00:10:52.540 --> 00:10:56.190
 I knew I knew the video was a fake of their music 

00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:02.399
 I have to say it's the strongest thing to come out with the song for anyone who thinks it does not matter 

00:11:03.490 --> 00:11:05.549
 But this I know you do. Oh 

00:11:06.339 --> 00:11:07.990
 thank you 

00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:15.000
 Let's go. Let's go. I think you are not good enough. Stop thinking that you are so beautiful. Stop thinking that you are not worth it 

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.399
 Stop thinking that you do not like to stop them. Goodbye to people who hate me 

00:11:20.399 --> 00:11:20.910
 you know what? 

00:11:20.910 --> 00:11:26.250
 I admire the Dover brothers is that they do not get a player like rice gum and all those others 

00:11:26.250 --> 00:11:28.250
 They write their own material 

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:33.539
 I saw you and you yourself are what you really say here 

00:11:34.209 --> 00:11:36.209
 awareness 

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:48.149
 They realized that you are missing you beautiful you strong will not be too long Oh 

00:11:54.430 --> 00:11:56.199
 Buga-Puja stops 

00:11:56.199 --> 00:12:01.169
 Okubo Kabu Kabu You are beautiful and if you are at this stage you think at least, as you know 

00:12:01.170 --> 00:12:06.599
 They make something that has a deeper meaning, it's a video against bullying. Maybe this is not good 

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:12.899
 But at least they tried, at least, they were not trying to be like a 10 team. No, no, no, no, no, no 

00:12:14.199 --> 00:12:18.269
 There is more to the brothers. It's about to get a lit remix 

00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.020
 Wow they got six nine 

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:34.070
 Now I own Roy with Spinner's head when I dance on the floor 

00:12:34.339 --> 00:12:39.859
 Falling is the track that already goes back for more. I do not mean to make fun of them 

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:45.830
 As if they already have problems, such as perhaps they already have autism or what Adam means in choosing people 

00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:50.089
 You know, I'm not trying to refer people here. But what's wrong with them? 

00:12:55.350 --> 00:12:59.779
 I watched his video before I knew who Kashi was 

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:05.750
 69 And I actually thought it was like doing a good job covering up on his face 

00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:12.799
 Make sure you can not see what I'm wondering about this video. This is 31 million views 

00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:20.869
 Here you are. There you have all that dobre brothers. Now filling up with that amazes me. What is the 

00:13:21.570 --> 00:13:26.330
 The army of children is there on YouTube which will give an abundance of views 

00:13:27.080 --> 00:13:29.480
 Literally anything that looks shiny and fun 

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:36.380
 These people make it seem easy, at least say you can admire that I do not have anything personal against them I think 

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:41.330
 It's funny how bad their videos are and they totally went under my radar 

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:45.650
 These people seem to be creeping out of nowhere. There is always only one new one 

00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:51.650
 Creepy like ... wish you enjoy you guys this video leave like if you have hit this button bel if you are new and 

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:57.889
 Subscribe to join that fraternity army. Right. We are looking for a new recruit 

00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:00.980
 You must be charmed by my body and soul and I love 

00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:04.340
 * Love is repeated several times, then the shocking ear rape: 3C 

00:14:04.340 --> 00:14:08.100
 ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ
