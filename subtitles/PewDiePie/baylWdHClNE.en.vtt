00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.740
 Hello, how are you guys? My name is Biodebay! As you can see 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.720
 I changed my desk again 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:09.220
 I'm in this new place, it's very cool and it's my place I am 

00:00:09.225 --> 00:00:12.015
 It certainly is .. 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.160
 Felix - my office I'm Jack - I chose the wrong house, stupid! 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.780
 Jack - this is where I am, my cell-lined Felix - I knew you were crazy 

00:00:20.335 --> 00:00:23.705
 Felix: I knew you were one of those people. 

00:00:24.785 --> 00:00:27.815
 We'll ring (five weird things online) 

00:00:27.815 --> 00:00:29.465
 With Jack Spidiese 

00:00:31.035 --> 00:00:34.465
 Felix - the first thing Jack - what will you start? Felix - I do not know 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.580
 Let's start at the top. I have this great box of stuff that I bought from online 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.420
 Jack-my God, Santa Claus 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.880
 Felix - Well, let's start with something trivial, but I want to try it 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.280
 Jack - what's called? Erzuka! 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:49.940
 Felix - Yes !! 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.040
 Jack - this game twice the size of this boy 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.520
 Felix - Yes, I feel that the scale is not true 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.320
 For this 

00:00:58.225 --> 00:01:01.115
 Felix - if these are bazookas 

00:01:01.945 --> 00:01:03.685
 This seems to need a great effort to assemble it 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.080
 Jack-no, looks great! 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.580
 Felix - What the hell is this ?! 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.100
 Jack - looks like something used by the dreaded Mega Man 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.880
 Felix - yes, it seems so 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.980
 Maybe you should read the instructions 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.700
 Felix - Are you ready? What are you doing? 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.960
 Jacques-Bazinka .. 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.580
 Felix-Bazinka! Are you ready to explode, my friend ?! 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.115
 Felix - how? Jack-no, you should pull him like that 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.440
 Felix - I knew this 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.660
 Damn! Well I understand now 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.760
 Felix - What distance should I ... Jack - I do not know! 

00:01:36.155 --> 00:01:38.565
 Felix - are you afraid now, young man? 

00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:40.720
 I used to make fun of him before 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.140
 Felix - I can see your stupid face from here as well 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.960
 (Jack) My God! (Felix) Was it bad? (Jack) was like .. Boom! 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.280
 No!! 

00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:56.215
 Well are you ready? 

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:58.135
 Jack - if you blink, you'll lose 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.500
 Jack - that's too bad! 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.280
 Felix - Thank God there was protection here 

00:02:08.615 --> 00:02:11.905
 (Felix) Did you really break it? (Jack) No .. Oh yeah I did 

00:02:13.815 --> 00:02:15.715
 Jack - this works well 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.980
 O Jesus Christ! 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.060
 Jack-and-sound as well 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.360
 Felix - Yes, it scares you a bit 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.000
 FELECIS 3 2 1 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.635
 Felix - How do I look? 

00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:36.595
 Jack - looks very strange 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:37.800
 Jack - Look at the camera 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.960
 (Felix) I can not see anything (Jack) You're very close 

00:02:42.475 --> 00:02:43.560
 Jack, my God 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.775
 Felix - I can not see myself in the screen even 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.420
 (See himself in the screen) Oh my God !! 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.840
 (Felix) What about Zik? (Jack) Very good! 

00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:53.515
 (Felix) is very cool (Jack) and comfortable (Felix) very cool! 

00:02:53.515 --> 00:02:56.305
 Felix - I love him too 

00:02:56.305 --> 00:02:59.065
 Felix - When I wore it, I remembered .. when I was five years old 

00:02:59.065 --> 00:03:01.905
 In the nursery, she played the character of Peter Pan 

00:03:02.275 --> 00:03:05.375
 Yes, I had exactly the same outfit 

00:03:05.375 --> 00:03:08.175
 But he was a pseudonym. I said: Well, he is not my king 

00:03:08.175 --> 00:03:10.965
 So should I take off my inner pants? 

00:03:10.965 --> 00:03:13.780
 (Jack) What ?! (Felix) I do not know was disgusting 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.520
 (Jack) But you made him even more disgusting (Felix) I know! I did not think because I was a child well? 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.860
 Felix - so I was naked on stage with him 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.560
 (Jack) So? (Felix) Yes! 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.080
 (Jack) Bold move (Felix) Yes of course 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.180
 Felix - Well to see what we have here 

00:03:27.355 --> 00:03:29.865
 Jack - I think I saw something inside, I'm excited about it 

00:03:29.865 --> 00:03:32.885
 (Felix) What did you see? (Jack) will not tell you 

00:03:32.885 --> 00:03:34.780
 Jack - I will not tell you, Felix 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.380
 (Jack) I want kids games !! (Felix) Children Games? 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:41.120
 Of course, for my cheek 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.220
 shut up! 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.780
 (Jack) What? (Felix) Do not worry, Jack Spidiese! 

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.775
 I have Robo Twist! 

00:03:51.775 --> 00:03:52.775
 My God!!!! 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.840
 He can wrap anything, I think he needs batteries 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:58.840
 I'm excited about this 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.075
 Imagine if an unmanned aerial vehicle flew over it 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.460
 And then damaged 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.400
 (Felix) There will be no effort (Jack) if we have another open box! 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.320
 are you ready? 

00:04:13.395 --> 00:04:16.295
 (Jack) Calm down, my mechanic (Felix) stops winding, my God 

00:04:17.655 --> 00:04:19.525
 Will not stop! 

00:04:20.095 --> 00:04:23.105
 I will not trust the ball again 

00:04:29.185 --> 00:04:31.465
 (Felix) How it works (Jack) I do not know 

00:04:32.915 --> 00:04:33.915
 Yeah! 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:43.000
 Yes, Robo Twist !! 

00:04:48.535 --> 00:04:51.525
 I was expecting this to break in my hand 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.900
 (Felix) that he would not stop (Jack) that he wanted to continue only 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.940
 (Jack) This was great! (Felix) What can defeat this? 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.040
 What defeats Robo Twist? 

00:05:09.045 --> 00:05:11.355
 I wanted to use them for a long time 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.860
 Because our clothes are similar 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:17.800
 (Jack) Yes! (Felix) we get .. 

00:05:17.925 --> 00:05:21.340
 That's what I saw in the box and I'm very happy 

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:25.625
 Jack - except he might need Felix batteries - really? 

00:05:30.575 --> 00:05:32.125
 Heck for Jack Ceptec 

00:05:32.885 --> 00:05:34.205
 I'll play without him 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.880
 Jack - do you insult me? Felix - no! Jack - You bitch! 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.560
 He's a whore 

00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.460
 I will challenge you 

00:05:45.465 --> 00:05:48.315
 So what is the most troublesome thing about 2 Uyobbers whose voice is very high? 

00:05:55.305 --> 00:05:58.135
 It's like looking at my voice 

00:06:00.405 --> 00:06:03.105
 My God, stop! O Jesus Christ 

00:06:03.265 --> 00:06:05.275
 We have to play something together 

00:06:10.065 --> 00:06:13.175
 (Jack) I do not know (Felix) This was great! 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.840
 I learned something from the Zelda game 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:20.520
 what the hell?! 

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.460
 Mouth again 

00:06:32.305 --> 00:06:35.255
 Are you the best orchestra player in Sweden? 

00:06:35.255 --> 00:06:37.055
 Of course thank you 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:40.960
 It's very nice though 

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.120
 What could be better? Damn I forgot that I have wings now 

00:07:00.535 --> 00:07:02.445
 Jack, do you like reading? 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:05.360
 Um .. No! 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.640
 Well, I have something for you 

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.240
 Readers lazy! 

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:13.580
 And what the hell ?! 

00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:15.800
 (Jack) Are these women's glasses? (Felix) they are more women's glasses 

00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:18.160
 They suit your clothes 

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.900
 My God, this is very strange! 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:23.820
 I walk and see my feet 

00:07:25.085 --> 00:07:26.085
 Hello boy! 

00:07:28.825 --> 00:07:29.825
 I saw.. 

00:07:31.215 --> 00:07:34.195
 I've seen your eyes! 

00:07:36.215 --> 00:07:39.145
 Can you see me, boy? I do not know if they can see me 

00:07:39.145 --> 00:07:40.865
 I do not see Ari 

00:07:41.885 --> 00:07:44.475
 They are very strange 

00:07:44.905 --> 00:07:47.845
 (Felix) They like playing a game (Jack) They are also clear 

00:07:47.845 --> 00:07:50.935
 (FLEX) and knob also, this is awesome! 

00:07:50.935 --> 00:07:52.895
 I understand it! 

00:07:53.635 --> 00:07:55.405
 that's cool! 

00:08:01.035 --> 00:08:02.035
 My God 

00:08:02.555 --> 00:08:03.625
 I purchased this ... 

00:08:03.995 --> 00:08:05.675
 She had bad reviews 

00:08:06.475 --> 00:08:09.415
 Stop doing this, it's scary 

00:08:14.925 --> 00:08:15.925
 This is really cool! 

00:08:17.815 --> 00:08:20.325
 Well I'll pass it on to you, are you ready? 

00:08:23.935 --> 00:08:26.075
 We were just grabbing our hands 

00:08:26.435 --> 00:08:29.565
 Are you ready? 

00:08:30.405 --> 00:08:33.455
 one more time! 

00:08:35.085 --> 00:08:38.145
 The last thing 

00:08:38.145 --> 00:08:40.775
 Felix - the last thing Jack, are you ready? Jack-yes 

00:08:41.225 --> 00:08:44.175
 I love this, bra change life 

00:08:44.275 --> 00:08:47.735
 Change life bra? we will see 

00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.360
 (Jack) It's a bra really? (Felix) Yes, but I do not know your size so I brought the little one 

00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:56.960
 Yes, this is accurate 

00:08:58.195 --> 00:08:59.255
 No 

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:08.660
 Well this has become very abrupt suddenly 

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:12.300
 This is your channel in 2017 

00:09:12.345 --> 00:09:14.715
 Do you want to help? 

00:09:14.715 --> 00:09:17.915
 Look like a Hawaiian dancer 

00:09:18.155 --> 00:09:21.295
 These are coconut 

00:09:21.715 --> 00:09:24.215
 This is what turned him into YouTube in 2017, high voices 

00:09:24.215 --> 00:09:26.875
 Jack - and Felix 's defection - leave admiration and lose Jack' s channel 

00:09:26.875 --> 00:09:30.265
 If you have not already done this for some reason, as usual 

00:09:30.745 --> 00:09:31.975
 Fist of sisters 

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:39.480
 What is the sound of 1000 jack septics ie combined? 

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:52.460
 It's darude-sandstorm 

00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.600
 We'll find out how to play someday, oh that's true! 

00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:11.340
 This is very good 

00:10:11.625 --> 00:10:13.205
 We will accept this
