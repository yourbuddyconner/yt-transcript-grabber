00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.460
 Welcome back to "War", I am Tom Scott. 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.350
 I am David Bodycombe. 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.370
 Today, professional game designer Hannah Nicklin 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.840
 And mathematician Katie Steckles 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.889
 To bring us a brilliant skill contest 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:13.570
 This game is called "Tumble it, scorpion!" 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.430
 The game is like this, you have four dice, then you have to pop them up 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.090
 Let them fall onto the wooden steps below 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.890
 It should be noted that there are different multipliers on the wood. 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.820
 For example, if you pick up a 3 point 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.890
 Just falls on the ladder with a multiplier of 4. 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.699
 Then you will get 12 points 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.650
 In the end, the winner is the winner, and the winner is the winner. 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.460
 That's right 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.020
 Ok. They are now guessing the box to decide who will attack first. 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.450
 Katie: Ok, I am the first attack. 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.239
 Steven: The atmosphere is super nervous (air tone) 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:41.870
 You make the atmosphere more tense! 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.190
 Feel the tension (air tone) 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.920
 So multiply 4 points by 1, because the dice fall in the interval of multiplier 1. 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.379
 Katie scored 4 points 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:49.989
 Yes, simple arithmetic 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.360
 I think the dice will turn like this instead of turning around, so... 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.020
 You are using physics! 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.629
 You can put the dice on the platform at the beginning in the way you like. 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:00.520
 Do you want to be so precise! 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:01.789
 This is basically impossible... 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:04.189
 Yes, you have no way to predict 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.720
 Wow! 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.720
 Steven: Three times exciting, Emma: My God. 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.180
 I seem to feel a faint sarcasm coming from the sofa area, just a little bit 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.000
 Katie: You make me nervous! Hannah: Very nervous. 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:19.760
 Ah, that’s a mistake. 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.680
 I think you use a 4 point to get a 4 point, at least you have not lost points. 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.220
 Positive thinking 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:26.140
 I don't think so 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.650
 I don't think so, so... 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.720
 You can also try to change the number of dice on your table by impact. 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.040
 So you can also hit the opponent? 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.800
 That's right, of course no problem. 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.540
 Oh! 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.460
 Oh my gosh! 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.110
 So how do you ask me to think positively! 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.420
 Obviously my game is playing very well! I mean, wait and see the situation. 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.210
 It’s not easy to do that. 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:45.500
 Safety card 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.710
 Ok, I accept at least a bit, not zero. 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:50.579
 We also practiced when we rehearsed, but it was really... 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.140
 But the scorpion will pass through the "door" every time. 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.280
 Yes, what Katie did is almost the same as my rehearsal. 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.579
 Just kidding! Ah, although only 1 is 

00:01:57.579 --> 00:02:01.840
 I just wanted to interfere with the scorpion on your desk... 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.130
 I want to say that Hannah is not a video game designer. 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.239
 It is a physical game in reality. So as far as I know, 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.310
 Dice and game board for her... 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.030
 Still, this is still an amazing technology. 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.630
 Actually, I am not left-handed, so... 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.160
 Can she target Katie's nephew and knock them out? 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.160
 Yes... but it also bears the risk of smashing the scorpion into the high zone. 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.390
 If it is me, I will play a little more conservative. 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.470
 According to my performance, that does not mean the last points 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:31.550
 The last round of this round 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.570
 Katie: Ok, Hannah: The last one is more conservative. 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.900
 Ok, get ready to start the second round. 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.819
 It doesn't matter, one of the two games. 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:43.450
 Reopened the game, it is currently Hannah 1 to 0 lead, the other side first 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.140
 Novice! Don't worry, I also won the first game. 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.390
 Have been knocked after 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.680
 Oh, she is going to put all the points six up. 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.379
 No, I am going to the five, and if it goes well, it will stop at six. 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:56.000
 Incredible strategy 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:59.239
 Oh, hell! real or fake? ! 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.799
 Ok, basically, if you want to play this game, do it. 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.440
 Tom: Just do it right! David: Very simple (just blame) 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.569
 How can this be? ! 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:09.519
 This score has to be chased, everyone. 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.720
 I have to knock it out, yes, this is what I have to do. 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.090
 That is... anyway, nothing is blocking you. 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.019
 This is the only strategy I am thinking of now. 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.920
 Ah, I still want to say that I want to knock you out! 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.190
 I think I seem to be falling down the stone now. 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.819
 Then I even fell into it myself. 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.500
 Does she have it? 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.500
 She already has 24 points, so it should be okay at the moment. 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.599
 Hannah: It doesn't matter, Emma: I almost succeeded. 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.500
 This is interesting 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.849
 is not that right 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.089
 Because if I can pick up some 3 then 

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:40.569
 I am so nervous. 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.280
 Ok, that's 6 points. 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.540
 Dramatic scene, right! Then what should I do with this dice? 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.019
 If I win with only one scorpion, it will be too fierce. 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:59.080
 You 24 points, I am 9 points, so I need at least... 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.250
 24 - 9 = 15 So I need to say... 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.370
 If she can get 5 on the multiplier 3, it will lead to at least a tie in this game. 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:08.859
 I decided, just do it! 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.220
 There are too many differences 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:15.360
 Don't worry about winning! Playing another game, I’m burning up my fighting spirit. 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.500
 This is a good game 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.630
 Hannah will enter the semi-final against Steven Bridges 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.910
 Of course, before this was Katie's knockout of the Emma Blackery. 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:26.590
 So what game do they want to play? 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.340
 Is a digital strategy game, Black Hole 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.410
 Ok, then let’s see you in the next issue! 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.960
