00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:04.000
So let's say it is 1908.
You need a lighthouse somewhere.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.740
But, there aren't any rocks to put it on.
There's just dangerous shores and shoals.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.940
The solution nowadays would be to build a large tower, anchor it to the sea bed,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.940
but 1908? The technology wasn't there, so the result is this:  The Ambrose.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.000
This is Mike Weiss, he's the waterfront foreman at the South Street Seaport Museum.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.660
Tell me about the Ambrose.
-It's a floating lighthouse.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.600
This ship is a lightouse. So she'd sit out in the channel, twelve crew at a time,

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.300
all weathers that came through.
In the middle of winter, it was freezing cold, snow on deck

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.500
or it's hurricane season, or there's massive waves coming through, storms, heavy fog...

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.700
-And she has to stay there with the light on, 
no matter what?

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.900
-Yes, she must hold her place, 
she must keep her station.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.200
-So there's a heck of an anchor on this thing, presumably?

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.600
-Yes, she's fitted with two mushroom anchors.
She'd use one at a time

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.300
unless things got really bad, I'd imagine, but they're each 5000lbs. [~2200kg]

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.320
It sat there in the channel, and ships would aim for it,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.400
now that isn't always a good thing, though 
-I was going to say, that sounds dangerous!

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.240
-You're sort of a sitting duck sometimes.
-Yeah, because a lighthouse is on rocks, you'll hit the rocks...

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.700
-Right so you'd aim for this area near the lighthouse.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.580
But, here, ships sometimes, especially in fog, there's always the very serious risk

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.140
that they will run into the lightship that was at station there.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.380
-So this ship saved lives? In a time where you couldn't put a lighthouse down,

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.460
you couldn't put anything solid 
to the seabed, there wasn't the technology,

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.580
This ship saved lives?
-Oh, without question, absolutely saved lives.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.340
-So the lightship Ambrose, one of very few
lightships remaining in the United States,

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:36.300
and in the world. Something that not just saved lives, but made this port city possible.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.160
Something you might not have known.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.720
Thank you very much to the
 South Street Seaport Museum

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.880
Their staff and volunteers are preserving a load of historic ships

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.880
if you're visiting New York 
do stop by,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.240
and if you're living in New York, 
they could always use some volunteers.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.240
