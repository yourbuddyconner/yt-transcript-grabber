00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.069
 There are only a few countries in the world that do not have rabies. For some 

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:09.350
 this is due to isolation and good quarantine measures, for example with island nations such as Groot- 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.840
 Britain. 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.930
 Rabies is a particularly unpleasant disease: it causes your brain to swell, affects your behavior, 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:22.199
 it makes you paranoid and reeling and is very painful. And then it is also deadly. There is a reason 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.940
 that it is known in French as 'la rage': the anger. Rabies was very frightening in the 19th century 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.289
 Britain. Every bite or crab from a stray dog â€‹â€‹or wild dog - and there were a lot of them 

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:38.739
 you could kill in a terrible way. It was almost certain that this was not going to happen - there were only 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:44.789
 about 1200 deaths in Britain due to rabies throughout the century. The risk was actually 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.219
 very small - but it was frightening for the British. 

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:54.260
 So there was what we would now call a war against rabies. Pets had to be muzzled. Wild dogs and roaming 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.260
 dogs were killed. There was a fight in the press and in public opinion between dog lovers 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:05.910
 and dog muzzles. Rabies was a threat that was incredibly exaggerated - but the measures 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.580
 worked. The last known case of rabies song caused by a British animal was in 1922. 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.800
 And you can be proud of the fact that Britain is now free of rabies. The United Kingdom does have a similar one 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.900
 virus in a few bats, but if you're not a veterinarian, or Bruce Wayne, the chances are you 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.050
 bitten is virtually nil. We have completely eradicated rabies. But even today 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.440
 we still see frightening headlines in tabloid newspapers about new threats about rabies, and how 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.330
 foreigners could cross the borders and let the virus in. 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.280
 That is why you still see signs like this in most of the busy ports in Great Britain. It is a reminder that 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.120
 whatever animal you bring to Great Britain on a commercial aircraft or boat is illegal. Not because 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:48.070
 there is a significant threat of rabies. Even if an infected dog was smuggled in, the disease would 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.100
 do not spread far. It would not cause an epidemic. 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.080
 But the reason that the sign is there is the same reason why Britain is free of rabies: because it is terrible. 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.490
 Because rabies is still part of the mindset of ideas, and because 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.210
 free of rabies, just like being an island state, has become part of our national identity.
