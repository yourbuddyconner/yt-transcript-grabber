00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.400
 I like to find exceptions of rules. 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.710
 The things that expose our assumptions about how the world works, 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.330
 and confuse any computer system that is not prepared for it. 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.620
 For example: streets have street names, right? 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.550
 Okay, some people will say right away: 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.850
 no, there are many streets that do not have names. 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:18.640
 In rural areas, for example, or in developing countries, 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.040
 or the type of roads indicated by a number or a letter. 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.720
 And some of you will say: oh, yes, and Japan then? 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.310
 Most of Japan does not name its streets; it names and numbers are blocks of houses, 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.460
 and moreover, it is more complicated than that ... 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.170
 Anyway. In a Western European country such as Germany, 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.149
 in the center of a big city like Mannheim, 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.429
 you would expect that there are street names. 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.559
 No. Welcome to the exception to the rule. 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.489
 Here in the Quadrates of Mannheim, the squares of the city center, 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.930
 have only a few main streets names. 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.129
 Every other building is referred to by the square on which it stands, as part of a grid. 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.139
 The western half receives the letters A through K; the eastern half L to U, 

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:59.679
 followed by the number of blocks counted from the center. 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:04.350
 So you can have C4, or in German "𝕮𝟜" [see-four], 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.909
 which explains why the museum that stands here is called Zephyr. 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.060
 Given the German reputation for humor, that is a pretty good multilingual wordplay. 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.409
 None of the modern card makers know what to do with this. 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.350
 They would not have a problem if the whole country would work with a different system, 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.020
 but a 'mix and match' in the same area, 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.359
 in a region where, as far as most people know, this is not normally done. 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:24.020
 they simply can not handle it. 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.860
 Google and Microsoft get confused and give multiple names every way. 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.520
 Apple insists that each road has only one name (and are completely wrong with that) 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.270
 but yes, it is Apple Maps. 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.119
 OpenStreetMap, which is run by a community, recognizes complete addresses, but not the individual blocks, 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.549
 although that will probably be restored within a few hours after the release of this video. 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.680
 This is also not a modern invention. 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.689
 This is not something of future-oriented city planners that rebuilt after the Second World War, 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:52.280
 or planners from the 80s who walked past themselves. 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.299
 While the numbering patterns have changed over the years, 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.530
 this piece of Mannheim has for some time been in some form of block numbering. 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.369
 Why would you change it just because some programmers do not know how to put it in their database? 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.250
 The programmers have only been there for a few years. This city has existed for centuries. 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.000
 An address here in the Quadratus is really just a number, a block, 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.820
 Mannheim, Germany. 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.480
 Even if some computers do not believe it.
