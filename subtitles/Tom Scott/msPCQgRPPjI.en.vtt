00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:02.321
 Today, the green canvas works easily. 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.120
 Set the lights correctly, give someone a camera, 

00:00:05.263 --> 00:00:09.522
 you have little to set up in your graphics software and you've got it done. 

00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:13.660
 But how did they do before the computers? 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.237
 There are two answers. One for the film strip, the other for the video. 

00:00:17.404 --> 00:00:22.542
 To make that clear, this is a summary, I skip the first attempts and blind aisles. 

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:24.450
 Let's see the movies first. 

00:00:24.569 --> 00:00:27.177
 Real bold movie strips. 

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:30.568
 There are no pixels here, everything is a chemical process. 

00:00:30.664 --> 00:00:34.964
 Light strikes the photosensitive tape 24 times per second. 

00:00:35.126 --> 00:00:38.068
 If you mess up something, you can not erase it. 

00:00:38.212 --> 00:00:40.736
 The belt is used and you have to buy a new one. 

00:00:40.927 --> 00:00:46.190
 The first methods included shooting an actor in front of a black background. 

00:00:46.346 --> 00:00:51.489
 Then, copies were made with increasing contrast until you had just a silhouette. 

00:00:51.788 --> 00:00:54.396
 This allows you to take advantage of a double exposure. 

00:00:54.492 --> 00:00:57.745
 They used chemistry and a thing called an optical printer. 

00:00:57.877 --> 00:01:01.752
 In the background, they created an opening into which an actor was placed. 

00:01:01.944 --> 00:01:05.197
 Or a part of an actor like Claud Rains in the Invisible Man. 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.683
 We have been using similar forms of contrasting methods for decades. 

00:01:09.827 --> 00:01:12.650
 The breakthrough was the discovery of a traveling mask. 

00:01:12.769 --> 00:01:14.755
 Disney, 

00:01:14.898 --> 00:01:18.283
 who was the only one in the world to have a camera that did it. 

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:21.848
 The actors played normally but stood in front of the white background, 

00:01:21.944 --> 00:01:25.138
 which was illuminated by the orange light of sodium lamps. 

00:01:25.305 --> 00:01:29.079
 Sodium light is monochrome, it only shines on one wavelength. 

00:01:29.199 --> 00:01:34.390
 Using the optics, you can shoot on one strip, ignoring the background 

00:01:34.575 --> 00:01:37.279
 and to the other that responds only to this light. 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.018
 This gives us an almost perfect traveling mask. 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.657
 It worked for semi-transparent objects, like a Mary Poppins hat. 

00:01:44.188 --> 00:01:48.111
 The green and blue cloths of analog films worked almost the same. 

00:01:48.197 --> 00:01:51.279
 They used filters that interrupted certain colors and created a mask. 

00:01:51.374 --> 00:01:53.939
 Then they carefully connected it to the optical printer. 

00:01:54.068 --> 00:01:56.786
 Then computers appeared and made it much easier. 

00:01:57.006 --> 00:01:58.881
 But what on TV? 

00:01:59.092 --> 00:02:01.269
 Computers originated before you think. 

00:02:01.365 --> 00:02:04.255
 The BBC used the Quantel Paintbox set 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.532
 ever since the shooting of Doctor Who in the 1980s. 

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:11.039
 But before that, the video consisted of only the electrical signals captured by the sensor. 

00:02:11.283 --> 00:02:14.499
 After recording, these signals were recorded on the magnetic tape. 

00:02:14.614 --> 00:02:16.451
 The film strip was not used. 

00:02:16.556 --> 00:02:19.427
 But you can combine electrical signals. 

00:02:19.561 --> 00:02:22.523
 You can build a circuit that will perform analog operations. 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.446
 Connect or create a transition between two signals 

00:02:25.523 --> 00:02:27.666
 they have already proven themselves in the beginnings of black and white television. 

00:02:27.714 --> 00:02:31.121
 In color TV you have red, green and blue signals. 

00:02:31.236 --> 00:02:35.647
 Although airborne compatibility has not been transferred separately, it is a long time. 

00:02:35.762 --> 00:02:39.073
 But you can create a system that will track signals, 

00:02:39.183 --> 00:02:41.671
 and when it captures the exact color you want, 

00:02:41.843 --> 00:02:44.484
 this will turn off the signal together with the background. 

00:02:44.724 --> 00:02:47.594
 This was used for live broadcasts. 

00:02:47.743 --> 00:02:52.370
 They even tried to create moving shots using a complex transfer system, 

00:02:52.542 --> 00:02:54.781
 which synchronized the motion of two cameras. 

00:02:54.891 --> 00:02:58.508
 One occupied the actor on a blue background, the other occupied the model. 

00:02:58.767 --> 00:03:00.470
 Sometimes it worked. 

00:03:00.642 --> 00:03:03.609
 No pixels, no memory or hard drives. 

00:03:03.724 --> 00:03:06.169
 You could not adjust the settings and try it differently. 

00:03:06.274 --> 00:03:08.704
 If it did not work, you did what you could. 

00:03:08.877 --> 00:03:11.786
 Every day in the studio was a stack of money 

00:03:11.896 --> 00:03:14.231
 and at least six technicians were required. 

00:03:14.685 --> 00:03:16.618
 And then the computers came 

00:03:16.771 --> 00:03:18.771
 and these techniques have become obsolete. 

00:03:18.944 --> 00:03:21.068
 Nowadays, maybe a nigger with a laptop 

00:03:21.221 --> 00:03:24.054
 and After Effects copies to create this video in one afternoon. 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.714
