00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.010
 At the turn of the millennium, ITV, 

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.860
 one of the main British stations, 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.710
 decided to name 2000 as the Year of Promise. 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.510
 They organized a long broadcast on The Year of the Promise, 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.210
 not for charging money for charity, 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.620
 but to call people and promise something. 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.880
 What we want: We want you to promise something. 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:19.860
 - And you'll make your mark in history. -- Exactly. 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.080
 They said the promises would be preserved forever. 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.900
 Registered in registers across the country. 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.279
 And if you pay ITV some money, 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.550
 your promise would also be written forever in a historic place somewhere in Britain. 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.190
 Historic as here in the East India Dock. 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.950
 A few years later there are hardly any signs that this has ever happened. 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:39.520
 But to tell the truth, 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.100
 I could say that in 2002 or 2003 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.980
 The public did not care about the Year of the Promise, 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.440
 and ITV has left the plan as soon as possible. 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.200
 At least as soon as it did without loss of reputation. 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.030
 The Internet Archive has most of their websites, 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.219
 and the National Library of Scotland probably has the only available copy 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.850
 CD with all promises, but all. 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.819
 Some benches and memorials with written promises still stand like this ... 

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:09.939
 But many of them were destroyed or moved under renovations, or simply weathered in time. 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:13.659
 Despite the millions that ITV has spent leaving a link in history-their words, 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:14.439
 not mine- 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.740
 promises were almost forgotten. 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.670
 Designing something that lasts is incredibly difficult. 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.170
 Although it is not just a commercial move. 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.189
 But it is: it can be one thing. 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:26.849
 The research proved an old urban reputation: 

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:31.619
 that writing a promise or a goal makes you more compelled to keep it. 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.130
 It helps when you tell someone about it. 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.579
 it helps when you leave it to engrave somewhere in the monument. 

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.679
 But just that it will be written, 

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:42.029
 even if you see it and no one else, 

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:45.270
 means that your human desire to remain consistent, 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.959
 be faithful to your personal values, 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:51.739
 it will cause you to be more likely to achieve it. 

00:01:51.739 --> 00:01:53.520
 Or at least it will cause you to say, 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.499
 when a reporter will ask you on the phone. 

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:00.669
 So I do not know if Kay O'Grady really cured OCD 

00:02:00.669 --> 00:02:04.119
 or if Susan Moussa really taught first aid. 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.590
 And maybe the lot of money ITV paid for their unlucky Year of Promise, 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.360
 could be used for other, much better things. 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.390
 But I like the idea that all the promises and commitments 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.599
 they eventually really brought the world good. 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.379
 Even though no one remembers them now. 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.940
