00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.480
This is the Technical Difficulties.
We're playing Citation Needed.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.980
Joining me in the studio today:
He reads books, you know — it's Chris Joel!

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.740
I can see that I'm destined to be permanently surprised
by us starting over and over again today.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.040
Everybody's favourite Gary Brannan — Gary Brannan!

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.680
And the bounciest man on the internet — Matt Gray!

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.860
Hello YouTube.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.800
In front of me I have an article from Wikipedia,
and these folks can't see it.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.680
Every fact they get right gets a point and a ding [DING],

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.120
and the special prize for particularly good answers,
which is...

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.600
[Sings]  Hitting the taaable!

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.080
[Laughter]
Oh no!

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.940
Forgot my buzzer.
Completely forgot to bring my buzzer.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.300
Today's article is...
The coffin ray.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.280
[Coughing] 'I'm a fish and I killed Steve Irwin.'

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.580
GARY and TOM: Ohhh.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.660
GARY: So R-A-Y.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.860
Yes, R-A-Y.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.860
MATT: ...Charles?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.320
First of all, you're getting a point for 'fish'. [DING]

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.400
Heyyy!

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.960
But it's not the one that killed Steve Irwin.

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.600
No, that one's already been sent to the electric chair.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:54.280
That was also a sting ray, which...

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.520
["Stingray" riff]
Da da laa dup daaa dup!

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.460
["Stingray" bassline]
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom!

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:00.340
[Steve Irwin voice]
'Crikey! I've got hold of it!'

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.220
'But anything could happen in the next half hour!'

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.300
No... he was killed by a stinger.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.320
This is a coffin ray, so it kills with...?

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:11.760
Coffins!

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.940
Just chucking boxes at folk.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:16.680
Shark... 'Come on! I'll 'ave yer!'

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:17.600
Yaaagh!

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.560
Scuba diver... Boom!

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.100
What you don't realize is,
he's actually a skilled carpenter as well.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.040
Is it some new version of like, Donkey Kong?

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.920
GARY: Yeah! Totally!

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.020
You know, for the Wii,
now you've got 3-D graphics, and...

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.080
Monkey and barrels, done to death.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.500
Right... boom!

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.900
Lob a coffin...

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.120
The thing is: beautiful brass handles,
all done out inside...

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.380
Bonus points if you can get the door to open,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.860
and close on what you're throwing it at...

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.900
and then it lands in the hole.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.400
Let's face it: that's the undertaker's dream, isn't it.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.460
It's got the diver going, 'Dat da da da...'

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.820
'What the... ooof!'
Boom! Doors closing — sea bed.

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.100
I like Gary's idea. You've got some sort of
Rube Goldberg machine...

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.480
So on the one hand, you've got your stiff laid out here,
your coffin here,

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.680
And just differently weighted catapults:
Badoong...

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.240
Whoosh — boomf!
[Laughter]

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.940
The coffin ray kills with something that isn't a stinger.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.100
Kindness.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.680
Withering put-downs.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.640
'I've seen better.'

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.440
Actually, he's got his tail,
that's in the shape of a pipe there.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.680
Yeah, just swept round.
Well, if it's not a stinger...!

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:20.460
Is it electrocution?

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.320
TOM: Yes it is. Have a point. [DING]
CHRIS: Heyyy!

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.560
Why the coffin ray, then?
I have never seen an electric coffin.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.720
Though I do want neon round mine, I've said that.

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:28.620
[Laughter]
Yeah. Yeah.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:29.660
CHRIS: That'd be cool.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.100
GARY: That's just a car battery
you'd need in there, isn't it?

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.940
Bzzt... bzzt.
'Occupied'.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.800
'No Rooms'.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.620
That is a good question, actually:
Why would it be called the coffin ray?

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.740
Given in mind it's a ray, so it's a flat fish.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.980
Does it kill you?

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.520
Probably because it's got that distinctive shape.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.360
That's a coffin shape.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.280
*You* get a point... [DING]
*You're* wrong — it doesn't.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.920
Normally it gives you a nasty shock,
but it doesn't generally kill people.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.820
But you're right, it gets bloated after...

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.040
Yeah. It's in your wardrobe at night when you get home...

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.780
GARY: Boo!
CHRIS: Aagh!

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.740
Wouldn't be so bad,
but it's filled the damn thing with water to survive!

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:01.780
TOM: Bloosh!
GARY: Actually no, it's...

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.920
It's in your bog system, isn't it?
[Laughter]

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.340
Bzzt! Bzzt!

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.340
'Occupied'.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.580
It's also called the crampfish.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:11.980
GARY: The crampfish?
TOM: Crampfish.

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.320
Is it because the electric shock merely inspires cramp?

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.840
No, it's because whoever it's with is made to look s***.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.340
[Laughter]
Cramps your style, man.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.260
Yes. The electric ray kills you with an electric shock,
or attempts to kill you with an electric shock.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.040
How does it generate that?

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.620
Friction!

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.740
It's got a piece of carpet on the bottom of the river...
[Laughter]

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.000
Goes back and forth and then sits there,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.380
going, 'F***ing Steve Irwin!'

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.520
I was going to say, pedal-powered dynamo behind it.
[Laughter]

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.520
Ah, that's brilliant!
What does it pedal with? It's got no feet.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:42.820
Little wings, it's got.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.820
No, it's peddling things. It's selling them.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.780
Yeah!

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:47.200
Ahh! Just buys batteries.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.240
TOM: Ah. Ah.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:50.980
CHRIS: Oh. Ah.
GARY: He's got a battery? F*** off.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.360
Er, point! [DING]

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:53.280
CHRIS: Duracell!

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.560
What, double A? What?

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.320
Surely it's a capacitor.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.720
It was essentially one of the inspirations for batteries,

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.060
when Alessandro Volta and Galvani...

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.060
...stuck one in the back of his radio
and noticed it worked briefly.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.640
MATT: It's got a lead-acid gland.
TOM: They were using it as...

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.620
Replace the steam engine with a fish!

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.680
'A bank of a thousand of these
could light an entire factory, Ichabod!'

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.040
'We've thrown one in the boiler. It's water...'

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.540
'Maybe we could *extract* the electricity.'

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.900
'And store it in a jar, or jug, or other piece.'

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.600
...a jug of electricity!

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:31.540
'Oh no, iPod's gone flat.'

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.840
Bloop-bloop-bloop!
'Crackin'!'

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:36.020
'Get the ray out...'

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.320
It is essentially what's called a voltaic pile.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.380
I've had them. I've got an ointment.
[Laughter]

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.820
Yeah. Okay.
I realized the moment that came out of my mouth...

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:49.100
Surely just something that's not properly earthed,
so you can just discharge them.

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.700
'Get that copper pipe away or it'll arc.'

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.740
Ba-boom!

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.340
Shortest route to ground!

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.140
Where do we find it? If you want to go and find a...

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.000
Water!

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.380
TOM: Okay. Yes. Not giving you a point for that.
GARY: The seas.

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:07.580
CHRIS: Not the seas. Rivers.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:08.740
MATT: Hot seas.
CHRIS: Big rivers.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:10.680
Er... you're closer. It's essentially...

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.740
The Deep Hole.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:12.660
Hull?

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:16.200
It's an ugly-looking fish that wants to kill you.
Where's it going to live?

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.400
— Australia.
— Point. [DING]

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.780
It's one of the few things that isn't poisonous.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.520
It can actually generate up to about two hundred volts.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.400
At what current?

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.960
Yes, I was going to say,
'It's the volts that jolts; it's the mills that kills.'

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:29.780
TOM: It doesn't actually say that but, er...

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.080
Ooo...

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:35.120
It also spends most of the day buried in sediment,
with only a little...

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.360
Building up friction.

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:37.200
GARY: Yep.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:40.940
'Don't you come near me, or so help you,
I'll stick you to the wall!'

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.600
But that is a...

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.740
It conceals itself on the sea floor,
which is a problem because...?

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:47.920
You stand on it.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:49.320
Point. [DING]

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.280
It turns out that if you just have
the ray sitting there in sand,

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.560
and you just pour some seawater on it, what happens?

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.500
It goes 'pfffftttt!' and arcs.

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.260
CHRIS: Wow!

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.860
I thought that was the arcing, but no! First, that's...

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.520
No, that was the flapping of the fish going 'Water!'

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:08.160
Building up the charge. I'm with you, yes.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:09.200
You get a shock up it.

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.100
Yeah, you do. [DING] It's still strong enough
that you can get enough of a shock

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.240
all the way up the seawater you're pouring on it.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:15.280
Don't piss on it.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:17.280
Don't piss on the electric ray!

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.200
I am... I have to look up and see if that advice...

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.940
I think you just don't piss on anyone called Ray.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.940
That's true.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.280
Men called Raymond have been
campaigning for that for years.

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:29.080
'Stop pissing on me!'

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.840
I can tell you that, having searched for that...

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.580
There's a lot of talk about urinating on an electric fence,

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:37.220
and standing on a ray...

00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.420
But as far as I can tell...

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.780
GARY: No one's done the two at the same time.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.780
No one has ever researched peeing on an electric ray.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.840
Nobody's stood on a fence and pissed on a fish.

00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.440
Australia, it's on you.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.360
[Laughter]

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.980
If any of you have weed on an electric ray and lived...

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:51.240
Well, you will have lived to tell the tale, but...

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.520
TOM: Yeah, do tell us in the comments.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.640
GARY: What's it like?
TOM: Yeah.

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:54.480
MATT: Or a video response.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.900
GARY: Oh yeah, film it.

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:57.460
Oh. Don't...!

00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:59.760
Do film it... just from a very careful angle.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
What does the coffin ray feed on?

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.220
Normally. I mean, obviously it shocks...

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.180
Coffins!

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:07.160
Plankton.

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:09.120
Er, no... bigger things than that.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.280
Big plankton.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.240
Close. No.

00:07:11.340 --> 00:07:12.200
Chips.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:14.060
TOM: Erm...

00:07:14.620 --> 00:07:16.160
MATT: Shrimp.
TOM: Like... you're...

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.200
I'm nowhere near!
Stop trying to manufacture this as a clue.

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:21.000
[Laughter]

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.380
Well, it's something that goes with chips...

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:23.040
Fish!

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.480
There we go! [DING]

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:26.180
'Benthic bony fishes'.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.020
Excuse me?

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:28.980
'Benthic bony fishes'.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.940
MATT: Benthic?
GARY: Is that a brand?

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.360
No, it's a depth in the ocean.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:37.080
It's a subset of the sort of strata
that exist in waters of the ocean.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:38.200
It is! Have a point. [DING]

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:39.460
CHRIS: Heyyy!
GARY: There you go. Well done.

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.180
MATT: Benthic.
CHRIS: Yeah, it's the benthic zone.

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:43.980
I can't remember if it's the top or the middle
or the bottom, but as you go down...

00:07:44.160 --> 00:07:45.820
So is that like in The Crystal Maze?

00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:47.360
You go through one, then you get to the Benthic zone...

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:49.880
Yeah! If Richard O'Brien was in scuba gear.

00:07:51.340 --> 00:07:53.780
And can we just pause for a second for that image?

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.940
...and all enjoy that image.

00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:56.280
He would look like a pint of Guinness.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.400
It's a three-quarter one.
They're cut off so you can see his bandy little legs...

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.860
Little harmonica attached to it just here.

00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.400
CHRIS: Yeah. Yeah.
GARY: You'd need a little... well, you'd need a belt.

00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.560
Instead of a knife in his boot: harmonica.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:08.480
Yeah. And actually the harmonica
is specially adapted to work underwater.

00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:09.480
CHRIS: Yeah, absolutely.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.440
I was seeing a belt for weights,
because he's quite a light fellow.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.200
Oh yeah, yeah. He's a spry lad.
We're going to have to...

00:08:13.340 --> 00:08:14.780
But he could have a harmonica clip there...

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:16.160
Yeah, and we're going deep,
so you know he needs a lot of weight.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.060
GARY: Wait, what are we talking about?
CHRIS: Going Deep, with Richard O'Brien.

00:08:18.180 --> 00:08:19.380
[Laughter]
Good name.

00:08:19.540 --> 00:08:21.480
You would pass through —
is the benthic zone at the top?

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.540
TOM: It's the bottom.
CHRIS: It's at the bottom? Oh, blimey.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.640
So you'd pass through the blah-blah-blah zone...

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:27.220
GARY: Industrial, Aztec...
CHRIS: And as the pressure increases,

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:31.420
there are distinct changes in salinity,
and what can exist there and so on.

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.920
And apparently the benthic zone is at the bottom.

00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:37.180
Can we now make Richard O'Brien's
Journey to the Bottom of the Sea?

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:38.660
I've just got the thought of it,

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:41.480
instead of being like your traditional
underwater nature documentary, narrated,

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.160
I actually want to see it presented by him doing
pieces to camera from the bottom of the ocean...

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.860
CHRIS: Yeah.

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.080
But all you'd hear is the honking, wheezing...
[Laughter]

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:50.880
[Honking, wheezing and bubbling]

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.760
When I signed the contract,
I assumed a submarine or diving bell.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.800
[Laughter]
Or bluescreen.

00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.880
You can't take a bluescreen underwater!

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:03.260
Take a greenscreen down,
and just 'Shop in a desert behind him.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:04.240
'...the hell?!'

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:06.580
[Bubbling]

00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.720
So this is Richard O'Brien's Journey to the Sahara
Under the Bottom of the Sea.

00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:14.040
Richard O'Brien Drowns in the Sahara, Under the Sea.

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.480
Sorry, Richard.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.220
There are some very large creatures that have been found in the stomachs of these rays...

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.240
Not just fishes. Any ideas what those might be?

00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.160
Sharks!

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.480
Duncan Goodhews.

00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.280
CHRIS: Max Bygraves.
[Laughter]

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:29.820
Not quite that kind of size.

00:09:30.060 --> 00:09:31.300
A truck.

00:09:32.340 --> 00:09:34.660
The International Space Station.

00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.660
Brian Blessed's underwear drawer.

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:39.500
Big underwear drawer.

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.260
Salma Hayek.

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:42.840
[Laughter]

00:09:43.540 --> 00:09:45.380
The Library of Alexandria.

00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:46.620
A Mark IV Cortina.

00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:47.700
[Laughter]

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:49.040
They're normally things on land...

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.800
A fridge!

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:50.820
TOM: But they are... they are...

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.760
Tigers!

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.320
Not quite that big. Erm...

00:09:53.460 --> 00:09:54.580
Vladimir Putin.

00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.120
[Laughter]

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:00.580
You said, 'big things that live on land'.

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:01.840
We'll get there eventually.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:03.520
Rats and penguins.

00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:04.420
Awww.

00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.620
Penguins?!

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:09.620
It's taken penguins. They've found...
penguins in the stomachs of these rays.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.160
I'm sorry, but I do find the image of...

00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:14.500
a penguin poddling across the beach,

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:16.300
and then suddenly going, BZZZZT!

00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.220
...quite hilarious.

00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:18.140
MATT: Awww.

00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:20.680
Would all his feathers fly off, and just leave him

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:23.980
kind of that pinky naked colour,
but with smoke coming out of his bill?

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.680
I met a penguin the other week.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:26.860
Was he in a shop?

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.700
Did you ask him that question?

00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:30.440
'What would happen if you were electrocuted?

00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:32.300
'Would your feathers fly off
and smoke come out of your bill?'

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:33.700
It didn't feel feathery.

00:10:33.820 --> 00:10:35.300
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa... 'feel'.

00:10:35.460 --> 00:10:37.800
Hang on. Rewind. How did you meet a penguin?

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:40.880
Okay, later question: How do you *feel* a penguin?

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:42.120
But first of all, how can you meet a penguin?

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.460
Well, kind of like this sort of thing...
[Laughter]

00:10:44.340 --> 00:10:45.480
'Oh my...'

00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.860
So I was in the desert...

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.560
...of course. With Richard O'Brien.

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.200
So you were actually under the sea, yeah?

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.020
And in said desert, in Dubai...

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.520
GARY: Oh, right...
TOM: Dubai, okay.

00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.840
Where anything happens and usually does...

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.960
Home of ridiculous buildings.

00:11:03.140 --> 00:11:05.180
Yes. There is a ski centre in Dubai.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.820
GARY: Naturellement.
CHRIS: Because you can.

00:11:06.940 --> 00:11:09.460
Because if you've got the money to live in Dubai,

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.480
you can't afford to fly to France and go on real snow.

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.140
So outside, it's 45 degrees. Inside, it's minus 4.

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:18.920
Was he greeting you as you entered?
'Wak.'

00:11:19.060 --> 00:11:20.420
They sort of wave as they run.

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:23.660
'Aaaa, it's Matt Gray! I seen you on the internet!'

00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:27.820
Were you supposed to be in the penguin enclosure?

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:32.600
Yeah, they have sort of a
penguin sanctuary kind of thing in this...

00:11:33.080 --> 00:11:35.700
TOM: For all those lost penguins in the desert.
GARY: For those lost desert penguins, yeah.

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:39.940
And yeah, they have a 'Meet the Penguins' experience.

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:42.720
You all sit on the bench, the penguins run in...

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:45.020
'Waheyyy!'

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:46.340
*That's* getting GIFed.

00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.400
[Laughter]

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.220
And then they're like, 'Do you want to touch it?'

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.000
GARY: That's a seedy question to ask, isn't it?

00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:55.760
'I'll touch a penguin.'

00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.980
And the penguin... they get the penguin
to stand like that in front of you.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.600
And you can touch its back and it... it feels like a snake.

00:12:02.220 --> 00:12:03.120
ALL: Oooo.

00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.580
Sort of waxy, scaly, rather than feathers.

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:06.980
Oh, it would be, wouldn't it? Because it's waterproofed.

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:10.000
Yeah. It's got wax on it!
[Spraying noises]

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:14.460
'You can touch this one. We've varnished it.
You'll not do any damage.'

00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:16.880
I was thinking sort of... that kind of thing, but no.

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:18.980
You'd just use a wax sprayer at the local car wash.

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.380
Come on. We're in Dubai...
are you going to think about that?

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.280
TOM: Yeah.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:24.000
And then they said...

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.500
'Do you want to hug it?'

00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:29.540
Were the actual words
'Would you like to hug with penguin' used?

00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:31.420
Yeah! 'Do you want to hug the penguin?'

00:12:31.700 --> 00:12:33.140
GARY: Yeah.
TOM: Yes.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:35.660
'Yes. I would like to hug that penguin.'

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.580
What do they smell like?

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:38.800
Fishy.

00:12:38.920 --> 00:12:40.000
Yeah, I thought they would.

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:42.400
Well, they're not going to
put some cologne on the penguin...

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.920
Honk honk honk!
[Spritzing sounds]

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.320
Ah, come on now.
A cat doesn't smell of lamb, does it? It smells like a cat.

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:51.320
So I don't know, why would they smell of fish
because that's what they eat?

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.300
Because they're a fish... ish thing.

00:12:53.460 --> 00:12:55.040
They're not a fish!

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:56.660
Penguins aren't fish!
...am I wrong?

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.680
They're birds.

00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.180
Exactly. Thank you.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.940
For a minute, you're starting to doubt
your own facts there, you know what I mean?

00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:04.400
'Penguins aren't... fish...?'

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.620
To be fair, I did actually have Wikipedia up at that point

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.180
just to check that a penguin was in fact a bird,

00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:11.140
and not some kind of fishy thing.

00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.140
All right. At the end of the show,
congratulations Matt, you win!

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:16.560
Yaaay!

00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:20.440
You win a replica of the singer of 'Livin' On A Prayer'
made of small chocolate sweet candies.

00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:22.540
It's a Bonbon Jovi.

00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:26.780
TOM: Thank you very much to Chris Joel!
CHRIS: Well, goodbye!

00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:28.120
TOM: To Gary Brannan!
GARY: Salutem.

00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.180
TOM: To Matt Gray!
MATT: Bye-bye.

00:13:29.180 --> 00:13:32.280
I've been Tom Scott. That's been the Technical Difficulties. We'll see you next time.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:37.940
Are we making a series of crematorium gags here?

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.400
CHRIS: Yes. To be...
GARY: 'To go where no man has been before!'

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:42.820
Crematorium Thunderbirds jokes, let's be clear.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:46.040
GARY: Let's be fair! We're not completely
stupid and irresponsible.

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.200
TOM: ...So he dropped out at nine miles...
GARY: Yeah.

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.680
TOM: Rode the rest of the way,
then the car broke down at mile 19...

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:53.920
and he just started jogging again!

00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:55.540
ALL: Oooo.

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:57.940
GARY: That sounds highbrow and commemorative.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.000
Oooh, it...

00:13:59.360 --> 00:14:01.460
As opposed to lowbrow and commemorative.

00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:02.800
Lowbrow commemoration!

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.300
'Dave's dead!'
[Laughter]

00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:07.120
'Back down t' pit!'

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:10.520
'We're commemorating this with a giant brass arse!'
