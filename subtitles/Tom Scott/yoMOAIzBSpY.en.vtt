00:00:00.068 --> 00:00:02.170
 YouTube does not know your password. 

00:00:02.323 --> 00:00:05.757
 Not Facebook, Twitter or any decent website. 

00:00:05.894 --> 00:00:09.499
 Your password is not really stored in their database. 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.147
 It's so safer. 

00:00:11.216 --> 00:00:14.991
 A hacker or a rogue employee does not know your password. 

00:00:15.205 --> 00:00:20.399
 But how can they know you have entered the correct password? 

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:25.063
 There are mathematical operations that are very easy in one direction, 

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:27.634
 but in the opposite direction very difficult. 

00:00:27.736 --> 00:00:31.085
 Multiplication of two prime numbers is easy. 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.972
 17 times 11 is 187. 

00:00:35.134 --> 00:00:39.849
 You can simply 17 multiply by 10 and add that number again. 

00:00:40.293 --> 00:00:42.651
 Because they are prime numbers, 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.298
 they are the only two numbers you multiply to 187. 

00:00:47.751 --> 00:00:49.775
 Let's try to ask the opposite. 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.338
 Multiplying the two prime numbers 

00:00:52.423 --> 00:00:56.054
 does a double prime number arise, say 299? 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:01.546
 It can not be two times because it does not end with an even number. 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.073
 It can not be three times something because the sum of digits is not divisible by three. 

00:01:06.175 --> 00:01:09.332
 It can not be five times something because it does not end with five or zero. 

00:01:09.414 --> 00:01:10.679
 Can it be seven? 

00:01:10.815 --> 00:01:12.824
 I do not know, I have to go for it in the long run. 

00:01:12.934 --> 00:01:14.622
 It can be a lot of numbers. 

00:01:14.704 --> 00:01:18.086
 There are a few tricks that computers or good mathematicians can use, 

00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:19.617
 to speed it up, 

00:01:19.672 --> 00:01:21.954
 but generally for large numbers 

00:01:22.098 --> 00:01:25.433
 there is no effective way of reversing the calculation. 

00:01:25.515 --> 00:01:29.547
 It is a math that makes it easy in one direction, but not the opposite. 

00:01:30.258 --> 00:01:34.276
 For you, the password is a string of letters, symbols, or numbers. 

00:01:34.365 --> 00:01:36.880
 But for the computer it's the same as everything else. 

00:01:36.941 --> 00:01:39.469
 Binary string. One and a Zero. 

00:01:39.613 --> 00:01:43.631
 With these numbers and zeros, the computer can work. 

00:01:43.768 --> 00:01:47.116
 Not always prime numbers, though sometimes they do. 

00:01:47.438 --> 00:01:49.310
 This process is called hash. 

00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:52.310
 Functions called &lt;i&gt; salt &lt;/ i&gt; are also used, but this is more complex. 

00:01:52.365 --> 00:01:53.977
 However, 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.046
 when registering, write your password, such as abc, 

00:01:57.176 --> 00:02:01.782
 it goes through processing and you get a random string of characters. 

00:02:01.898 --> 00:02:03.866
 They keep it in the database. 

00:02:04.173 --> 00:02:06.825
 When you re-enter your password when logging in, 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.946
 it goes through the same one-way mathematical operation again. 

00:02:11.082 --> 00:02:15.264
 If the resulting hash matches that in the database, 

00:02:16.064 --> 00:02:17.909
 they know that you have entered the correct password, 

00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:21.271
 although they do not know exactly what you have entered. 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:23.390
 If they are properly treated, 

00:02:23.458 --> 00:02:26.438
 you can not convert hash back to password, 

00:02:26.526 --> 00:02:30.483
 if you do not have centuries of computing time or billions of dollars available. 

00:02:31.105 --> 00:02:33.934
 This is why Google, Facebook, Yahoo and other sites 

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:36.845
 missed forgotten password by email. 

00:02:36.934 --> 00:02:38.431
 They ask you for a new one. 

00:02:38.492 --> 00:02:41.034
 They can not send you because they do not know him. 

00:02:41.171 --> 00:02:46.946
 When you find a page that sends you a forgotten password by email, 

00:02:47.055 --> 00:02:48.408
 run away, 

00:02:48.517 --> 00:02:51.387
 because of the cough for safety. 

00:02:53.082 --> 00:02:54.695
 If you are interested, 

00:02:54.763 --> 00:02:58.618
 on Computerphile, I shot some longer shouting and security videos. 

00:02:58.905 --> 00:03:00.558
 And if not ... 

00:03:00.681 --> 00:03:04.426
 The stunning piece will be shown here by trained drivers. 

00:03:04.514 --> 00:03:06.291
 Do not try it at home! 

00:03:06.468 --> 00:03:10.063
