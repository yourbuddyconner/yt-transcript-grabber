00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.370
 I am still in Antarctica, so today's guest video comes from Chase of ScienceC, 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.649
 of all 150 pitches I received, he sent me the best. 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:09.590
 He started with, "Hi Tom, 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.710
 "I am dissolving two of my sister's teeth in soft drinks." 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.280
 I have to confess something. 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.680
 I love Mountain Dew. 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.289
 I think my weather balloon video alone needed a few packs of 12. 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.159
 Mountain Dew is not really known as the most healthy drink. 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:30.099
 So today I show you how badly Mountain Dew is, with the help of a small experiment 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.099
 for your teeth. 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:33.109
 I have two choices of my sisters here. 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:36.190
 I both washed them in a bottle of Mountain Dew, 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.980
 and a Coca-Cola bottle for the next three weeks. 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.899
 Let's see what happens! 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.699
 These teeth have soaked in the soda during the last two weeks and five days. 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:48.500
 Before we take them out and weigh them, 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.510
 a bit of background information about this soft drink 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.039
 The Mountain Dew here has a pH value of about 3.1 

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.190
 while the Coca-Cola has a pH value of 2.5. 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.980
 That makes it six times more acidic than the Mountain Dew. 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.860
 Let's take out the teeth and see how much their mass has changed. 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.060
 I pour the Mountain Dew into this, and take out the tooth ... 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.030
 I got the tooth out, and as you can see, it looks much yellower, 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.840
 certainly the root. 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.640
 Wow, wow, wow ... 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.920
 This tooth does not look good at all. 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.590
 He is completely black around the crown, 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.409
 and he just looks unappetizing and dirty. 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:33.370
 I clean it with a little water. 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.799
 Now that the teeth are dry, if you look closely, 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.829
 then you can see a lot of the glaze that was there 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.409
 - the white stuff - is away from where it used to be. 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:45.910
 And at the Coca-Cola tooth you can not see much, 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.910
 because it is so blotchy. 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.909
 Now that the teeth are dry enough, we weigh them. 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.110
 The Coca-Cola tooth weighs .80 g, 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.079
 which means that he is .06 g lighter than before. 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:05.490
 If you look at the Mountain Dew tooth, we can see that it weighs .81 g. 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:12.220
 That means that it is 13 hundredths of a gram lighter than before. 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.260
 Well, if we take into account the initial mass of the teeth 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.030
 we can see that the Mountain Dew tooth lost 14% of its mass, 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.030
 while the Coca-Cola tooth has only lost 7% mass. 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.590
 Half of what the Mountain Dew lost. 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.620
 Because Coca-Cola is six times more acidic than Mountain Dew, 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.040
 would you expect it to rot faster than Mountain Dew. 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.300
 That is not the case for two reasons: 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.010
 And the first factor is the titratable acidity. 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.880
 pH is a measure of the height of the acidity. 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.489
 That means that the Coca-Cola is more acidic than Mountain Dew. 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.940
 But Mountain Dew has a higher titratable acidity than Coca-Cola. 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.099
 That means it's more biting than Coca-Cola. 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:03.099
 That means it takes longer for the saliva in your mouth to dilute the acid. 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.160
 than with most cola drinks. 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.480
 on top of that 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:10.409
 it is also the kind of acid that makes the difference. 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:13.220
 Mountain Dew, like most non-cola drinks, 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.620
 added citric acid. 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.500
 And citric acid is an organic acid, 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.340
 which means that the calcium in your teeth breaks down faster 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.049
 than the non-organic acids, such as the phosphoric acid in most cola drinks. 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.770
 This ultimately means that Mountain Dew is worse for your teeth than Coca-Cola, 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.220
 also if Coca-Cola is much more acidic, 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.319
 and that is something you may not have known. 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.319
 Thank you, Tom. 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:39.319
 Thank you, Chase! 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.040
 I thought I had left that slogan behind. 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.140
 Subscribe to his channel, he has some great videos coming up, 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.790
 left on the screen or in the description now. 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:46.790
 And let's be honest, 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.800
 he has my job in 5 or 10 years, you are early. 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.909
 Next time: we have a very well-known part of China.
