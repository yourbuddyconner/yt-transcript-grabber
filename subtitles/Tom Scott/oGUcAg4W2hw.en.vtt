00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.920
 This is Bruges, in Belgium, 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.640
 known for chocolate, lace and beer. 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.499
 And this is the Half Moon Brewery. 

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:09.610
 There is a brewery here for five centuries now. 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.460
 There were once thirty in this city, but modern production 

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.589
 and making enough beer to meet the demand for export 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:16.980
 make that difficult. 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.250
 Half-moon brewery moved bottling out of town years ago, 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.880
 about 3 kilometers, but the brewing stayed here. 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.450
 This was the last brewery in Bruges. 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.580
 New brewers have recently come up with new ideas, 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:32.809
 so we are no longer the only ones, 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.410
 but certainly the oldest. 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.420
 Why should we change the location of the brewery? 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.600
 Logistics is difficult if the entire city is a monumental heritage. 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.429
 Getting the ingredients into the city was difficult enough 

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.899
 but also allow tankers to drive through the cobbled streets, 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:51.239
 fill them with beer and then bring them to the bottler three kilometers away, 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.649
 Well, they needed a better solution. 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:54.710
 So, they made it. 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.899
 The beer goes directly from the brewing room to the pipeline 

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:01.519
 and goes from a storage tank here in the center of Bruges 

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:04.470
 to another tank on the other side in the bottler. 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.850
 The pipeline is about the size, that is the outer diameter 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.220
 and there are four tubes of about eight centimeters in diameter. 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.480
 The beer goes through with about five to six thousand liters per hour. 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:24.020
 That is not fast enough to put pressure on, it is relatively slow. 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:28.720
 As a result, a load of beer takes about an hour to get to the other side. 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.660
 The beer enters the facility here and then goes into one of these large tanks, 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.180
 the lagging takes about three weeks 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.410
 then the beer is filtered, pasteurized, we add sugar and yeast 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:43.780
 and then everything goes in a bottle. 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.090
 The yeast in the bottle has to do the second fermentation, 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.490
 and that happens in a warm room. 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.550
 After the transport we clean the tubes with cleaning agents, 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.000
 we do disinfection in the tube 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.520
 and then we flush about three hundred liters of water through it 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.170
 before beer goes through it again. 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.550
 Outside the center, next to the highways 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.180
 normal excavators were fine. 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.629
 But more creative approaches had to be used here. 

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.810
 Getting a building permit was not easy, 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.850
 but we were lucky with some forward thinking people in the city 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.810
 who agreed with the plan and gave us the permit. 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.260
 The tube is below good, so only under the streets 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.239
 and not under houses or private areas 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.019
 and they even drilled from a distance, 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:34.049
 so they make a hole on every corner of the street 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.189
 and then they have a guided drill so they do not 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.129
 to have to open the whole street to drill. 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:43.959
 Four months of construction is not normally found, 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.640
 but the local people of Bruges thought it was something special. 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.590
 Local people first thought it was a joke according to me. 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.349
 People were making a lot of jokes about it 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.239
 draining the pipeline and getting beer to their home or kitchen. 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:05.400
 It would be impossible to connect a pub or even a house to the pipeline, 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.409
 but, that's why we made it a crowdfunding, 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.329
 that's where the idea came from, 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.180
 so that people could contribute to getting some beer for the rest of life, 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.569
 what a replacement was for having a small tap in their own house! 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:20.709
 A big thank you to everyone at the half-moon brewery in Bruges.
