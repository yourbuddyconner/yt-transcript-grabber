00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.490
 Swiss machines are known for their accuracy and reliability. 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.870
 And Switzerland is famous for its ... not strictly paranoid, 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.599
 but certainly a large number of security measures. 

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:12.519
 Switzerland is the only state in the world, 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.059
 which has enough anatomic shelters for all residents. 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.160
 Even now the law requires that each newly built house 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.310
 had a cover if it was not close to an existing cover. 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.550
 Yes, nowadays, these covers are mainly used as a warehouse, 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.240
 mostly for cheese, but what if something goes wrong? 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.460
 Switzerland is ready. 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.110
 And this also applies to this - 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.180
 drinking water. 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.500
 I am in Zurich, the largest city in Switzerland, 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.060
 and it has a complete backup water system. 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.320
 There are hundreds of drinking water fountains for the public, 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.829
 in various embodiments. 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.110
 Most of them are powered from the same pipeline as households and offices, 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.800
 filtered water from nearby Lake of Zurich 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.910
 mixed with a little spring and ground water. 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.670
 It is, of course, one of the safest drinking water in the world, 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.370
 because of Switzerland. 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.829
 But in case of emergency - 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.010
 let's say the lake was somehow contaminated, 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:08.130
 or there has been a long-term power outage and the pump has shut down 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.729
 (it is unlikely that electricity supplies are equally well secured), 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.930
 but if that happens, Zurich is ready. 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.890
 They have the entire backup water system, 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.960
 which feeds only gravity and a spring on a nearby mountain. 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.840
 There are 150 kilometers of pipelines to hospitals and anatomical shelters 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.770
 and special fountains with drinking water like this one. 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.800
 These can be adjusted to fill a bunch of buckets 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:33.720
 in a very short time, 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.409
 with just a few hoses and scaffolding. 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.409
 By the way, this is not a waste of water. 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.600
 No one does not drink it, 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.450
 but even if it did not flow through this pipeline, 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.590
 she would come into the river and find her way to the sea. 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.689
 Many cities have some duplicate water resources: 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.829
 backup pipelines or emergency tanks in case everything fails. 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:53.969
 But in Zurich? 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:57.240
 Here are two systems, constantly tested, 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:59.450
 which work together. 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.049
 If the end of the world happened to happen.
