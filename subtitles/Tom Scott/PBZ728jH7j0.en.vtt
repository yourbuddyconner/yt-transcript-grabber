00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:02.480
 I'm in Resolute, Nunavut, Canada, 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.339
 the last stop on my journey in the Arctic. 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:08.150
 It is one of the northernmost and coldest inhabited areas in the world. 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.190
 and the only reason I have permission to film here now, 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.150
 is because we have someone watching for polar bears. 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.860
 There are signs of prehistoric settlements here, 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:16.980
 but this city did not exist until 1947, 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.800
 when the USA and Canada built a weather station here. 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.360
 And there were no permanent residents before 1953, 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.640
 then the Canadian government displaced inductors from northern Querbec to it, 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.500
 as part of the power play during the Cold War. 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.439
 The North Arctic Movement is a dark chapter in Canada's history. 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.640
 and the stories from those who were moved to outrageous relationships, 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.890
 are stories that are best told by people who were here, not by some British tourist. 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:41.399
 There are links to source material, in the description, 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.050
 and I strongly recommend seeing them. 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.269
 What I can tell you is why the Canadian government in the 50s 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:49.850
 thought it was worth moving people up with red, 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.280
 and moving their home to the north. 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.020
 The North Pole and most of the Polar Sea are international waters. 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.120
 There is no solid ground under the ice, 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.819
 so the same rules apply as for the Atlantic and Pacific. 

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:03.000
 But, unlike countries further south, 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.289
 where it is easy to determine where coastline and sea meet, 

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:08.820
 it is a little more complicated up here to the north. 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.409
 In the fifties there was an unresolved legal dilemma: 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.600
 If no one lived on these northern islands, 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.549
 if not even habitable 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.200
 Could they actually be part of Canada? 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.810
 Especially when the United States sent hundreds of troops up here, 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.340
 to claim the area and build a defense against the Soviet Union. 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.560
 The shortest route between Russia and America, for atomic bomb flying - 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.590
 and later - for intercontinental missiles, 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.070
 is over the North Pole. 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.250
 Just over where I am. 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.250
 About Resolute. 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.620
 But where the Canadian government was happy with the cooperation with America, 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.469
 then it would not risk being pushed out. 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:44.899
 The government's solution was then: 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.109
 Move some people that it doesn't seem to matter 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:48.890
 and make it clear to the rest of the world, 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.340
 that this is a Canadian area. 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.340
 See! 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.460
 Canadians live here. 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.950
 The consequences of this are on the day, 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.079
 And so do the discussions about the domination of the area as well. 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.880
 But for other reasons. 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.969
 Because the cold war is over, 

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.430
 and hopefully no missiles will fly over the North Pole in the near future, 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.630
 There is now a very different problem. 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:10.420
 Climate change means that the Northwest Passage, 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.560
 the once famous waterway through northern Canada 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.360
 is now - theoretically - open to ship passage for a few months a year. 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.910
 Northern Canada is not only frost ice that goes all the way to the North Pole, 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:25.000
 and most maps are quite misleading. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.450
 This is an island in an archipelago, 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.690
 which is not as big as it seems on most cards. 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.650
 and if there is no ice between them, then it is a shortcut. 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.099
 The Polar Sea now provides the opportunity to sail along the road between Europe and the American west coast, 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.610
 instead of sailing through the Panama Canal. 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.600
 And it covers 6,400 km of travel. 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.620
 The first cruise ship has already sailed through: 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.510
 And at the time of watching the video, it is sailed through. 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.810
 And it's not an old icebreaker with 100 people, like the one I sail with, 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.740
 but a huge cruise ship, with thousands of people on board, 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.490
 eight restaurants and a casino. 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.830
 You like it or not, the area here - 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.980
 is part of a tourist area now. 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.870
 But Canada claims that some of the Northwest Passage is part of their national sea areas 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.290
 almost like a large and wide river. 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.870
 So, if someone goes through it, it must be approved by them 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:12.710
 they must be subject to Canadian law, and perhaps they must - 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:14.370
 for the future pay a tax. 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:15.400
 USA and Europe 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.070
 claim it is international waters and that they can do what they want here. 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.310
 And the consequences could be serious, 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.370
 if this becomes a busy shipping route. 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.180
 For sooner or later there will be a major casualty, 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.820
 especially if climate change causes unpredictable storms over this sea. 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.690
 The idea that there will be more oil spills in the Arctic region is worrying a lot of people. 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.510
 In a few decades, when the ice melts, several waterways are opened, 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.030
 and oil and gas extraction becomes possible, 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.320
 become our next international dispute, 

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.790
 political or otherwise, perhaps disputes over the Polar lands. 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.800
 Not just about who owns them, but for their entire future. 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.840
 Hi, my name is Chris Hatfield and this is ... 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.850
 My name is Tom Scott! 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.900
 His name is Tom Scott, and we are here in the Polar Regions. 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.600
 That's it, from "Generator Arctic"! 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:57.600
 That was all! 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.320
 It has been an incredible experience, thank you for taking along. 

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.160
 Go to the written website where you can see all the details. 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.240
 And take a look at their performance, Massey Hall, Toronto, Canada. 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:10.320
 Chris, the camera - take it - come on! 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.780
 Go into the water - come on. 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.420
 Hov, it's not that bad!
