00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.600
Today's show is sponsored by
Sean Bean's Invasion Team:

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.940
"Lancashire's ****ed."

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.770
This is the Technical Difficulties.
We're playing Citation Needed.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.620
I have an almost randomly selected article

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.880
from everybody's favorite reliable source of knowledge, Wikipedia,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.580
And these folks can't see it.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.120
Every fact they get right is a point and a ding [DING],

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.740
And there's a special prize for
particularly good answers which is:

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.540
— Oh yeah!
— Oh my.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.020
And today's article is: the Newgate Novel.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.180
Ooh! We've gone highbrow all of a sudden.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.580
We have. Yes.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:37.540
I'll put on my best smoking jacket and clever cravat.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.120
— Clever cravat?
— Clever crav...?

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.480
Is that like an iCravat?

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.660
"Cravat? Cravat, quickly, it's the pub quiz."

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.660
Right, Newgate.
Is this something to do with the prison by any chance?

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.260
Er... to an extent. Yes.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.380
In that it's to do with the prison or not?

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:54.360
Not quite.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.560
Straight answers please, nobhead.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.240
It's based on something called
the "Newgate Calendar",

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.240
Which is... it's connected to prisons.
It's connected to criminals.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.780
Is it an execution calendar?

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.940
Yes. It was originally a monthly bulletin of executions.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.540
I'll give you a point for that. [DING]

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.590
It's what would be known as the calendar of prisoners,

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.170
of those who are due to be tried
or indeed executed later in the year.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.700
But it got turned into something else.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.580
A sixteen-part TV series starring...

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.120
Daniel Craig, Sean Bean and Alex Kingston.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.880
This is mid-18th century here, so...

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.820
Yeah, and?

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:25.980
...Little bit earlier.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.320
So Sean Bean could've still been in it.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:28.360
Sean Bean's in it.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.700
It's a weekly series of plays.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.079
So it wasn't the short-lived opponent
to Babestation then?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.240
Ohh!

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.700
No. Not even close.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.560
Mid-18th century strumpets asking for letters.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.100
That's basically just a classified ad
in the back of the London Gazette.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.000
With a slightly lewd picture,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.120
and a mailbox to send your money to.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.840
A coffee house to pop round
and talk through a screen to someone.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.500
"Please make way to the coffee house
and ask for the back room.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:01:59.949
"Charge: three guineas."

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.500
Yeah, when you get there it's a...

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.820
a complete glass thing so you can't go in.

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.669
And there's a little flap you can open
for a pound a minute to talk to people...

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:06.840
Oo-er!
[Laughter]

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.109
Oh for crying out loud!

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.520
A flap for a pound a minute!

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.880
Jesus. Where do you go?

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.060
So what did the Newgate calendar turn into?

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.380
It was originally just a diary or bulletin of executions.

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.650
London's top tourist attraction.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.980
It isn't the London Dungeon, no.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.720
But it kind of had that entertainment...

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.920
Was it serialised like an early Dickens sort of a deal?

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.360
I will give you a point for that.  [DING]

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.520
The calendar was basically ripped off
by a load of other publishers,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.050
who then put out biographical...

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.320
"chapbooks", it's called here,

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.110
about the notorious criminals.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.619
Oh yeah, chapbooks...

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.829
This is getting desirably highbrow, but yeah,

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.349
chapbooks were small, cheap sources of literature.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.400
Of course it is now desirable to say
there was also not only the chapbook,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.260
but the "face book" at the time as well,

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.560
which was A Thing.

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:58.379
Well, the name for Facebook
came from university facebooks,

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.259
which was literally a book of all the faces of the people
who joined the university that year.

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.159
But the 18th-Century facebook was —
you would have one in your house.

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.919
Someone would go around

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:07.579
and as part of the evening's entertainment

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.740
would try and draw their own face.

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:10.719
Really?

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.560
Oh, cool!

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.120
Right? And it would provoke much mirth
when you went, "Oh, look at the paucity!"

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.820
"Look at the eyebrows, Jeremiah!"

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.120
You know, that kind of thing.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.740
Of which later on when everyone else came round

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.560
"Oh, you should see the page before you
at what the Parson drew!"

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.760
That kind of thing.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.260
That was a face book.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.400
It was a mid-18th century thing.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.620
I'm getting one of those.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:30.600
I'm having one in my house, that sounds great.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.440
Hey! Before you go. Draw your face.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:34.380
Go-on. I dare ye.
NO MIRRORS!

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.420
Stop cheating! All you get is this marker pen,

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.420
or a knife to draw in your own blood.

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.200
I like the idea of there being
some sort of Bartholomew Zuckerberg.

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:44.500
Who was... er...

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.500
"Bye ye the newe Facebou..."

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.760
No, that's Middle English isn't it?
That's going way back!

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.960
You don't buy it.

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.920
He just takes yours, adds a load of adverts to it,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.720
and then sells it back to you.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:56.620
Satire.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.520
"One has heard he can make
up to three guineas an hour!"

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.300
Which he spends a pound a minute.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:04.420
Pound a minute!

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:05.520
Talking into a flap.

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.620
With furious strumpets behind the flap.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.120
Prog band!

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.840
"Hello, we're the Furious Strumpets."

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.060
Yeeaah!

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.080
"This number is called 'Behind the Flap'."

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.800
Oh no. I like that being like some kind of prog band...

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:22.400
— All-female prog band.
— Oh, okay!

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.060
"Furious Strumpets" is a good name for that.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.720
Furious Strumpets. Who's on keyboards?

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.540
So, the Newgate calendar became the Newgate novel.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.220
Yep.

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:33.100
Which was, sort of, longer books...

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.700
Very much satirised by a famous author.

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.320
Rory Bremner.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:39.960
Little bit earlier.

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.680
Dickens Dickens Dickens.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:42.900
No! Dickens...

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.680
There's a good argument that one of Dickens' novels
is a Newgate novel.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.160
Johnathan Swift?

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.080
No.

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.720
Chaucer?

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.720
I think he may have been earlier there.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.280
Centuries out. Centuries out.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.140
No, there is one Dickens novel that is glorifying crime.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.840
Oliver Twist?

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.160
Bingo. Point. [DING]

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:00.040
Yeah. Oh, thank you.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.160
Oh, very good. Hmm.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.760
"Name a Dickens novel about crime, Gary."
"Uh, Ollliverrr...?"

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.600
I was in a Dickens musical once.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.560
— Oh really?
— Were you?

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.940
— Yes.
— What the Dickens?

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.340
I know! I know.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:11.380
Who did you play?

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:15.180
I played, er, Wackford Squeers.

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:16.160
Oh! Yeah yeah yeah.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.220
In the musical "Smike",

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:20.740
that is a musical version of Nicholas Nickleby.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:22.700
Hold on to your hats.

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:24.340
There's a musical version of Nicholas Nickleby?

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:25.140
Yes! And I was a...

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.520
And what pitch range did you take?

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.360
Oh God, whatever I had when I was fifteen or something.
You know.

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:33.420
Somewhere between Mickey Mouse and Paul Robeson.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:37.280
[Voice breaking]
That weird oooscillatory one we all haaad!

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:40.140
So yeah, Dickens satirised the Newgate calendar then?

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:42.740
No, Dickens essentially wrote a Newgate novel,

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.520
or something that is considered to be.

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.160
Right.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.640
— If I say William Makepeace Thackeray...
— Oh, okay.

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:49.300
...I'm looking over at him, do you know what he wrote?

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.880
Not read any... Well... Oh...

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.540
Thackeray, Thackeray, Thackeray.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:53.580
Not off the top of my head, no.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:54.900
— Vanity Fair.
— Ah.

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.120
Which was satirising all of 19th-century Britain.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.260
Oh, okay.

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:02.700
No-one takes that. Okay.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:05.200
What, you want us to satirise 19th-century Britain?

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.600
"I'd say Gladstone has been too near the buffet recently!"

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.600
"I would say he's looking remarkably corpulent

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:12.940
around his middle areas, oh ho ho!"

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:13.500
Actually no, that...

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.380
No, that's observational comedy.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:19.200
Gladstone, he did have his peccadillos, didn't he?

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:20.660
He had his thing.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:23.620
He would go out into London —
I think it's Gladstone...

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.640
Hire a prostitute,

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.100
which was the done thing,

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:30.940
take her home, and then talk to her.

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:33.780
For the duration of the booked period...

00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.760
lecture her about not being a prostitute,

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.140
then throw her out and whip himself on the back.

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.980
...that was his thing.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.200
At the beginning of that paragraph
I thought you were talking about piccalilli.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.540
And I was hoping for a story about toast, or sandwiches.

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:50.720
F***, who puts piccalilli on toast?!

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:51.900
I was going to say.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.700
There's something wrong with you if you're putting piccalilli on toast.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:55.020
Hang on we've gone from Gladstone...

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.360
Never mind the mishearing.
Never mind how quickly we've moved through this.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:01.480
The hell are you doing putting piccalilli on toast?

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.020
You might as well put mustard in your eyes!

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:05.880
It's a horrible thing to do!

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.080
— I've had mustard on toast before.
— Mmm.

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:09.920
— What?!
— What is wrong with... wait, what?

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.260
Nothing wrong with mustard on toast.

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:12.680
It's like having sweet chilli on toast, or...

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.100
Just mustard?

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:16.100
— Hmm...
— And butter as well.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.560
— And probably black pepper if it was me.
— Oh fine! We got the butter, that's fine!

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.140
Which mustard, English? French? What?

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:20.780

— English!

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.860
I like how you're doing this tennis thing here.

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:26.160
We must know! We must know!

00:07:26.160 --> 00:07:28.380
Brannan's terrified. He's encountered things he doesn't understand.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:31.580
You've opened Brannan's eyes to a whole new area of condiment-based toast.

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:33.580
Have you never had condiments on toast before?

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:34.300
No!

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.980
Er, er... I've had cheese and brown sauce.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.120
No, no, that's cheese.

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:39.840
Yeah. We're talking tomato sauce sandwich here.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.460
WHAT?

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:41.760
Tartar sauce sandwich!

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.400
Aahh!

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:44.460
Jesus.

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.760
Horseradish?

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.600
Oh!

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.140
Horseradish on toast.

00:07:48.140 --> 00:07:50.140
Forget the toast. Out of the jar, with a spoon.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.200
Right! Behind the unseeing eye ahead of me.

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:54.420
If you've ev... it's not just these two,

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:56.540
If you've actually put a condiment —

00:07:56.540 --> 00:07:58.640
and only a condiment, on toast,

00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:00.440
E-mail in, write in,

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.900
send a telegram, or a pigeon,
or your butler or something.

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:06.000
Oh wait, no, to be fair
I've had sandwich pickle on toast before.

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000
— That's not a...
— ♫ Piccalilli! ♫

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.220
Oh no, hold on Gary. That's a good point.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:11.220
It's like having gherkins on toast with mayo.

00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:13.220
— Whoa, you can't say...
— Whoa, whoa whoa!

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.560
Whoa, whoa. You can't say "it's just..."

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.040
That sounds pretty good.
I've never had that.

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:18.040
If I can... If I can drag this back.

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:19.380
— Good luck, mate!
— That's like having...

00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.020
For f***'s sake, that's like having
Yop on a baguette.

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:25.200
I mean you're just putting...
substances together...

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:28.480
The Newgate novel. If I can bring this back...

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.000
What's that got to do with tartar sauce?

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.960
One of the convicts was done for tartar sauce rustling.

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:35.860
Rolling a barrel of tartar sauce down the street.

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:37.940
Surely tartar sauce clinking, with it being in jars...

00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:40.040
— No, no, just a barrel of it.
— A vat.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:42.160
"Now then, now then, now then.
What's in that barrel, sir?"

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.200
"...Water..."

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.800
"Let me stick my bit of bread in there, sir."

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.080
"I have a slice of toast here.

00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:50.560
"It just so happens that, if this is water,
it will be utterly spoiled.

00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.380
"However, if it is tartar sauce,

00:08:52.380 --> 00:08:54.380
"as we know, that is a great delicacy.

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.340
"My lad,

00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:59.400
"delicious though this is,
I am taking you in for tartar sauce rustling."

00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:02.880
Of course in France they took up the idea,
and replaced truncheons with baguettes.

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:05.580
First day: it's for eating.

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:08.200
Second day: it's for beating convicts to death with.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.220
For eatin' and beatin'!

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:12.920
Sorry, are you saying a baguette lasts a day?
In the afternoon it's for beating!

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:17.180
"We 'ave invented a bread product zat
lasts no more zan an hour!"

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:21.300
"I have taken zis bread 'ome.
She is wasted."

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.160
"She is wasted."

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.760
I'm sorry, are we pissing off
a different nationality each show here?

00:09:25.760 --> 00:09:27.500
Looking that way. Looking that way.

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.720
The only way to get a fresh baguette

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.700
is to actually have some kind of bread-baguette-slot

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:35.020
on a boulangerie,
that you wrap your mouth round and have one...

00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:36.340
Where am I going with this?!

00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:38.560
I don't know where you're going with that, Branners!

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:39.740
You want one just... fed!

00:09:39.740 --> 00:09:41.420
And a hot baguette thrust into your throat.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:45.000
It's a pound a minute, you open the flap,
you take whatever's on the other side!

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.340
A centime for ten minutes!

00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:49.560
— They just extrude out a bread product...
— It's a... baguette! That'll do.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.320
Yeah. Fine. I'm okay with that.

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.600
You've not got any tartar sauce have you?

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:59.200
If I were to say "Jack Sheppard",
would that ring a bell with anyone?

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.320
I would rather not, thank you.

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:02.420
How do you rate him?

00:10:05.620 --> 00:10:07.160
"Jack" was a verb, right?

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.220
Jack Sheppard was a notorious thief

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.640
who had a two-year criminal career

00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:13.320
before being hanged at Tyburn.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.960
But the novel, the dramatisation of that,

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.400
was the most notorious Newgate novel.

00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.040
Mmm.

00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:21.600
William Thackeray,
who was one of the opponents of the Newgate novel,

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:25.660
said that there were vendors selling
Jack Sheppard bags.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:27.100
Now what do you think they contained?

00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:28.600
Little bits of him.

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:29.460
...no.

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:30.540
Swag?

00:10:30.820 --> 00:10:31.780
No.

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.700
Copies of the novel, some novelty golf balls...

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.200
a mouse mat, something like that.

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.260
Nope, 'cos by this point the novel...

00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.000
Mouse mat?

00:10:43.100 --> 00:10:45.100
Yeah, what do you think you put a trap on?

00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:49.200
— In the eighteenth century?
— Ohhh...

00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:51.680
The novel had been turned into a play by this point.

00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:53.400
So in the lobby of the theatre, as they left...

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.940
— Signed copies of the script.
— No.

00:10:56.400 --> 00:10:59.660
Signed, erm, lithographs of the stars.

00:10:59.820 --> 00:11:02.060
Is this something truly disgusting,

00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:03.960
owing to the fact he was hung... Death by hanging?

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:05.120
— No.
— His urine?
— No!

00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:06.880
So it's not a picture of the deceased like this...?

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.120
— Carving.
— On the...

00:11:09.300 --> 00:11:10.460
No. Nope.

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:13.640
Instructions on how to thieve?

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:14.200
Yes.

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.120
No way!

00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:18.260
[DING]  Filled with burglary tools.

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.220
Hey, that's something.
You know when you're walking on the Moors,

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.560
— you have the thumb sticks?
— Yes.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.740
You know they were entirely outlawed
for quite a long time?

00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:27.040
— No.
— Genuinely illegal, were thumb sticks.

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.700
— Because what you...
— Sorry, what are thumb sticks?

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.240
— They're a walking stick with a Y shape.
— They've got a U shape top on.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:33.160
So you can give it this number.

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.080
— Often seen by ruddy men of the country.
— Yes.

00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.880
You know, striding around with them.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:40.720
Spot the person who doesn't go hiking on the Moors.

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.460
Oh, [dismissive sounds]. Yeah. Anyway.

00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:46.500
They were outlawed because
the thumb over the middle

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.700
was often used to disguise a hole.

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:51.320
Into which you would screw in a hook

00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:53.120
with some string and another hook on the end.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:55.120
They'd be used when robbing houses.

00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:57.400
You would dangle it in,
hook something out, and walk off.

00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.420
And of course walking with the thumb over the hole.

00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:01.540
— So they were banned as a criminal instrument.
— Brilliant!

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:04.840
I'm gonna go get my dad
to turn me one out like that.

00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:09.520
"Come on, son. We're going hang-thieving!"

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.940
The Newgate novel started to fall out of fashion.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.480
Ainsworth and Lytton were two of the novelists who

00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:19.600
turned away when the attacks on it started.

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.080
Who didn't? Who continued to use criminals?

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:22.820
— Dickens?
— Dickens?

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:24.440
— Dickens.  [DING]
—Ah, right.
— There we go.

00:12:24.440 --> 00:12:27.220
Dickens, it says here, was "made of sterner stuff".

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.280
Made of more commercially lucrative stuff,
as I like to call it.

00:12:30.480 --> 00:12:30.980
Yes.

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.220
Didn't balk at giving the public what they wanted.

00:12:34.220 --> 00:12:36.660
Yes. So it became "sensation novels".

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:40.540
Charles "There's my 500 words,
where's my fifty pounds" Dickens.

00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:42.300
Yes. Pretty much.

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.740
That's why his style is... as it is.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:46.000
Bloody long!

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:47.740
That's why he's so long-winded, you know.

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:52.000
"I should hate to pontificate over this for too long,
as excess verbosity will lead to..."

00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:53.380
...yeah?

00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:56.560
I've probably said before,
my favorite Dickens line is the one about

00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.560
the door knocker in A Christmas Carol,

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:02.760
"which, having not undergone any
intermediate process of change"...

00:13:06.220 --> 00:13:07.100
Wow.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:09.860
You're just like: "Oh. Oh! Oh."

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.680
Word count!

00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.280
Yup.

00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:14.500
And... that'll do.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.800
Submit!

00:13:16.040 --> 00:13:18.480
Yes, 'cause he just clicked a button
and it word-counted and...

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:19.640
No, he went...

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.300
that action is ringing a bell
for his butler to come up the stairs...

00:13:23.300 --> 00:13:25.300
Or a boy to come and take it to the...

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.720
With a celebratory slice of toast and tartar!

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:31.880
The Newgate novels became the sensation novels,
the detective fiction...

00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:33.760
They got serialised.

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.360
What did they become?

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.480
Frosties!

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:38.860
...Cereal-ised...

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:41.000
Oh, yes!

00:13:41.820 --> 00:13:43.960
The pun! It burns!

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:46.380
Uh, I was going to go for The Bill.

00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:50.380
That's fair, that's fair. Little bit earlier than that.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:51.840
Ye Bill!

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.060
Particular name for them.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:55.080
The penny dreadfuls.

00:13:55.080 --> 00:13:56.100
Yes! Point!  [DING]

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:56.800
Point straight away.

00:13:56.800 --> 00:14:00.300
Quick-fire round: Can anyone give me
the other names for the penny dreadfuls?

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:01.360
What else were they called?

00:14:01.360 --> 00:14:03.840
Uh, filthy newsbooks... Uh...

00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.560
The shilling sh**s.

00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:07.600
Dirty foldabouts...

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.940
Thou-shalt-nots...

00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:10.380
"Don't look in there, mother"s...

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:12.200
They were all kind-of "penny something".

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:15.920
Penny whatsits... Have you got one... Naughty novels...

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.720
Uh... Penny frighteners? Something like that...

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.720
Some kind of synonym for "dreadful" would be a start.

00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.800
— Awfuls.
— Oh, point.  [DING]

00:14:20.800 --> 00:14:22.480
Yay! Look at that.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.620
Penny dreadful and a penny awful.

00:14:24.620 --> 00:14:27.300
Penny horrible, penny number and penny blood.

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.000
At the end of that, congratulations Chris!

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:31.000
— You win this show.
— Hey! I'm on a roll.

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.060
More points when your way then anything else there.

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.840
Uh, you win some shares in the company
that is owned by the star of The Big Lebowski,

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.620
that enables passengers to board airliners safely.
