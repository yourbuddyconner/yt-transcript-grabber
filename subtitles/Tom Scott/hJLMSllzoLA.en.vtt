00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.680
 I received a lot of requests to talk about the loophole in iPhone devices - those that 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.599
 If you send this message via a message, the receiver phone will hang. 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.929
 Now there are a lot of theories, Apple has not confirmed any of them. 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.010
 I have not seen any in-depth analysis. So, this combination of some explanations 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:24.640
 More realistic that I found 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.920
 And also my experience on this phone. 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.250
 Idea # 1: It does not always work. It is not like the old iPhone loophole 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.020
 If you try to render certain text anywhere in the operating system. 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.710
 This is a minute .. It should appear in the dropdown notices banner, 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.550
 And sometimes works .. This is an idea: what happens to the text in the dropdown notices banner 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.750
 And does not happen anywhere else? abbreviation. You see the first letters .. 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.030
 The first words, then point point point at the end. 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.030
 The first words, then point point point at the end. 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.309
 Directly, here is an indication of the problem. Because shortening text is not an easy process 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.590
 As you might think. 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.680
 Apple is smart. They do not cut text based on the number of bytes, the naive way to do it. 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.320
 If they do, the phones will collapse constantly for those who use emoticons. 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.940
 And do not interrupt the text based on a specified number of characters as well. 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.400
 For iPhone Specifies how much text you can display based on screen size 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.200
 The font size in which notifications are displayed, and the content of the message itself. 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.370
 It always cuts a character, not a byte. Can you display the full message? Great .. view them all. 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:34.760
 Is the text too large? So, how many characters can be displayed? 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.600
 Well, what's the odd thing about this letter? For people in England, the United States, and more .. 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.030
 Contains Arabic text. Not a plain text, but a strange Arabic text! 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.200
 Text with the composition, those signs that are above and below the letters (explains the movements). 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.180
 Here is the stud of the Persians. English words at first is not a problem, and the shapes in the end as well. 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.560
 You can put any text there, as long as the pieces 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.520
 Be somewhere in the middle of the mixture of Arabic letters. 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.760
 We can say - somewhat - that the problem with dealing with the Arabic text. This is almost obvious. 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.190
 IPhone tries to cut off the strange Arabic word from the middle .. It fails for some reason 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.390
 And somewhere there, there is the defect that leads to the collapse of the device. 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.170
 This part we are almost certain of. Here's my expectation: It seems logical when it is 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.950
 You remove a character by pressing the clear button, the length of the text becomes shorter. 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.950
 But in Arabic, this is not always the case. 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.440
 Arabic text is something really interesting: the letters have multiple forms 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.500
 The character changes its shape based on its position in the word at first, in the middle or end of the word. 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.000
 I found some texts - I do not know if they are used on a daily basis - where adding a character makes the word shorter !! 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.640
 I found some texts - I do not know if they are used on a daily basis - where adding a character makes the word shorter !! 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.990
 So that if this text is cut from the middle, the output will be longer than the original text before cutting. 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:58.230
 So I guess, the phone tries to calculate how many characters can be displayed on the screen, 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.990
 And finds a strange text so that if it is cut it becomes longer. 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:09.990
 This looks like an unexpected event that will cause a bug in the code 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:15.290
 Written mostly by people who write in English. 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.740
 But what do you know? We have to wait and see if Apple will find a solution after the problem, 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.599
 Or will be resolved in the next version.
