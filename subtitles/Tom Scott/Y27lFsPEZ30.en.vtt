00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.300
Down below me are the forests
of British Columbia, BC for short.

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.140
They're home to people -
a few, anyway - wildlife, and

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.790
basically every alien planet
that Stargate SG-1 ever went to.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:12.350
Now I don't want to be too simplistic here,

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:15.980
but forests are made of wood.
And wood is flammable.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.050
Very flammable.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.860
Just over that ridge is the
site of the Elaho wildfire,

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.060
which in 2015 burned an area
the size of Manhattan

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.420
over 10 weeks.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.780
And that was just a small one.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:33.340
In 2017, 19 wildfires combined together
to burn an area 130km end-to-end.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.700
- Since about 2003, we have been having
continuously record-breaking temperatures,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.250
record-breaking droughts, and
record-breaking fire seasons.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.188
The fires that we have
observed in the last decade

00:00:45.188 --> 00:00:50.190
are large, aggressive fires that are
very difficult to control.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.960
Often, when we see fires, we look at them
and think they're destructive, but in truth,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.280
many fires do more good than harm.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.140
We see, in our northern forests,

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.950
trees are actually adapted
to release their seeds

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.700
and to grow back after a major fire,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.460
which burns from tree top to tree top

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.250
and kills those trees,
creating large openings.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.640
In our drier ecosystems, they're
kind of a lower intensity surface fire

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.220
that cleanses the forest,
takes away the dead grasses,

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.100
the branches that have accumulated
down on the ground,

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.170
but leaves the big trees that
are resistant to that fire

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.230
and create a very healthy ecosystem
that is dependent on fire.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.640
- Now, I grew up in England,
where there's not much woodland left

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.860
and what there is
is carefully managed and controlled.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.810
So to me, the idea that fire could
be a good thing is counterintuitive.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.990
And don't get me wrong, playing
with matches in a forest

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.980
is still a very bad idea.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.220
But it turns out that
having a professional

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.210
set a precise fire at
a precise time and place

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.220
could actually be a good idea.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.420
- In absence of fires,
the fuels have built up in the forests

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.830
and now, when we have fires, they're
even more intense than they were in the past.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.440
Historically, we know that fires,
in parts of the province,

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.400
especially in the dry forests of
British Columbia, were really frequent.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:07.240
So these are fires that would burn through
the understory of the forest

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.360
and in those forests,

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.500
we have thick-barked trees
that are adapted to fire.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.210
So they resist the fire and they survive.

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.580
Each of these marks down at the bottom
that you can see

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.110
is a fire scar embedded in the tree
rings and it is showing

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.360
the history of fire in this
particular environment.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.145
There are enough fire scars
embedded in the tree rings

00:02:27.145 --> 00:02:31.530
that it burned 42 times over its lifetime.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.278
Up until 2010, our policy in
BC was 100% fire suppression.

00:02:36.278 --> 00:02:40.450
So we would try to detect and
suppress fires as quickly as possible.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.500
As of 2012, we changed to
allow managed wildfires

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.730
on the landscape, allowing
some fires in remote areas

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.670
where it doesn't put human
lives or values at risk.

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.670
Those managed fires are trying to get

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.550
the ecosystem to function
as it did historically.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.880
So if we go into those areas that have
dense forests right up to our backyards

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.800
and if we assess those forests
and remove some of the trees,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.050
in particular,
the small trees in the understory,

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:09.590
and then come in and use a prescribed burn

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.220
to clean up all the
small fuels on the ground

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.040
and stimulate all those
fire-adapted plants in the understory,

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.860
we can not only reduce the risk
of fire damaging our communities,

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.930
but we can restore our ecosystems
and improve ecosystem health.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.890
- My pilot today has been Bradley Friesen,
along with--

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.060
- Mr. Bentley, the dog.
- Co-pilot back there.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.540
And you're starting a channel soon called?

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.460
- Destruction by Gravity.
- That's gonna be a fun one.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.950
There's not much there
yet, but check it out.

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.128
I think there's gonna be some fun stuff.

00:03:36.128 --> 00:03:38.870
Thank you to you, thank you
also to Dr. Lori Daniels at UBC.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.620
- A lot of fun, I liked it.
