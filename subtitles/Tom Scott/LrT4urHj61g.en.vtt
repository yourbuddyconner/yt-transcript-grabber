00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.270
 I film in the desert of California with YouTube's Field Day team - And a drone. 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:10.490
 If we spot other aircraft flying nearby, we will immediately land 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.400
 Because, that's just a sure thing to do. There is a small municipal airport a few kilometers away 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.470
 But there is no traffic and visibility is perfect today. But here's a pretty scary one 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.100
 Statistics: In the United States, there were more than a hundred dense clashes between drones 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.650
 and manned aircraft every month this year. That means the plane or helicopter was 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.920
 close enough to the pilot to see the drone - because, they are not 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.480
 visible on radar. 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.570
 Given that there are 30,000 passengers traveling every day in the United States, it is not an additional reason 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.180
 for alarm. It is only what, about one in 10,000 pilots who have seen a drone, have just come 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.329
 close to one. But: there are stories of drones crashing past passenger aircraft as they 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.670
 is about to land just to get a good picture, while fire helicopters are being grounded 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.100
 Until a fool with a drone stops holding his YouTube viewer number higher a fire extinguisher. 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.540
 Hoof! - In the UK, you must be allowed to operate a movie drone commercially, 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.549
 even if it is only with YouTube advertising. And you will need special approval to operate within 50 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.860
 meters of people or buildings you do not have complete control over. And yes, far 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.610
 The majority of individual drone operators ignore it completely, knowing that 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.930
 The police force does not have the time or energy to haul into them. 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.560
 In the United States, laws vary by state and often change so I don't even want to 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.259
 Try to sum them up, other than to mention that the drone boys here certainly follow them. 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.680
 I think the world is about one to two years away from the first collision. If it is with 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.850
 a big plane, then the drone will destroy one engine and everyone will surely be unharmed. 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.520
 But if it's a small civilian plane, or something like a paraglider: 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.630
 No matter what, it is where the law actually begins to haul in and where there will be more 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.719
 people arrested for what Britain calls "approximate violations" than the full fool that crashed 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.079
 his drone in the garden of the White House, this year. 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.920
 Everything is alright. Get her off! 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.530
 And if you want to know why I'm here, with all those weird lines in the desert around me: 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:18.069
 So check out my day in the field, out in California City. 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:20.390
 Man, it's going to look great. 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.970
 Everything OK? (Cutter)
