00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.820
 It's supposed to be difficult if you're a little kid 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.460
 I do not have 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.280
 I have no idea how to play, all right? I'm moving this with the mouse. Okay. Easy! 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.500
 If you can not beat this game, 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:45.720

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.280
 Yeah 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.920

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.470
 My God.

 There is a new striker, clearly. Rikin. "Oh, oh this will be bad. 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:14.039
 There is nothing wrong. You know what, it's okay. I see - I see what to do, okay? I have to launch myself there, 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.709
 Which is easy. This is easy. 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.839
 You could be playing a little easier, please? I mean harder. You know - eh oh 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.209
 There it is, you've got to keep the momentum going, clearly. You gotta pop so you do not stop, 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.320
 And if you do not stop 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.060
 Then you are not pop. Now, to love God, do not fall down - 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.240

 It's not, it's really not a problem. Do not worry me Benny. Mr. Foudi. do not worry about that. 

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:10.560

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.540
 This will save the universe. 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.240
 Look at it. right Now, 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.680
 Let's not fall down. 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:40.560
 Stop 

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:49.800
 I know what the task is. 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:08.880

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.110
 We are ok. 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.480
 Why would you make a game that made me lose that great progress? 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.540
 SKRRRA! Easy friends, easy friends, easy. 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.430
 Use your core power. Think of your Pix after all this. 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:55.490
 Easy, please, please, please. If anyone is struggling with this game, they need to be a killer - Oh. 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.790
 This is a dumb game. 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.950
 Yeah 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.660
 Look at it friends, look at it. Thanks. I want to thank God Oh. My God. 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.080
 This sounds really hard there. Can I stand on this coffee cup? No, 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.860
 I can not. Thank you, a cup of coffee to serve for any purpose but to piss me off. 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.530
 I will go here. 

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.719
 Now we're gonna play a little slower, a game. A little slower, but that's okay. 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:26.990
 I'm going to - Oh 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.259
 Carefully pull myself out, because you do not want to make mistakes. 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.119
 Not at this point, because we clearly have a checkpoint here. This is - 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.160
 Yes really? Yes. Yes I know. 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.840

00:06:07.569 --> 00:06:09.569
 Pull yourself together, friends. 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:12.759

 Easy! Well, we got it. This is a checkpoint. This is definitely a checkpoint. 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.129
 You know this guy is gonna make the next slippery stone or something. 

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:22.990
 Why am I stuck here? 

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.990
 There we go. 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:30.509
 Oh my god dude, I like natural talent. Please, where is my reward for this game? 

00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:40.289

 Okay. Do this in any way 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.750
 Amusing? I just really - I actually enjoyed the game. It's really interesting. 

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:39.930
 It works. 

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.330
 It works really well. 

00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:49.259
 Ah, damn it. But damn it, it's frustrating. It seems easy. 

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:55.229
 But this is not really. It really does not. My God. 

00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:00.600
 This game is gonna kill people. I know that he. This game is gonna hurt people. 

00:08:01.540 --> 00:08:06.420
 People will die on this game. Well, I got this move down. 

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:14.040
 Oh, oh, I guess we're almost there. I actually think we can do it. Well, pull, pull friends. 

00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.309
 I know you are stuck. Like it's stuck but not. 

00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:21.630
 We say no. We are knights. This,

00:08:31.280 --> 00:08:36.900
 If you fall there, to the left, I do not even want to think about it 

00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.540
 Now, now, relax. 

00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.580
