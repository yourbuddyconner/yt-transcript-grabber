00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.939
 I have been to the Arctic for three weeks, 

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:05.190
 and while I'm away a few guest presenters take over the channel. 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.450
 We start with Sally le Page, 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.660
 a biologist from Oxford university 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.330
 who is going to talk about the world's longest working battery. 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.210
 Be nice, I'll see you in three weeks. 

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.210
 Go ahead, Sally! 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.310
 I am here in Clarendon lab in Oxford, 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.070
 where physicists save a battery with the longest lifespan in the world. 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.910
 He supplies energy for the 'Oxford electric bell', 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.310
 and has been running almost uninterrupted for more than 176 years. 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.929
 He was bought by Reverend Robert Walker 

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:37.289
 who was a reader in experimental philosophy at Oxford. 

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.550
 That's what they called physicists at that time, 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:43.309
 and hopefully that will show you how long ago we are now. 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:44.890
 He bought it in 1840. 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:48.609
 Let's take a look at that in the context. 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.319
 If we go back 60 years, it's 1780. 

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:55.030
 'Mad King George' is still on the British throne, 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.039
 the US declared independence 4 years before, 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.229
 and Napoleon is still in school. 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:04.489
 In Italy, physicist Luigi Galvani 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.140
 frog legs are being dissected with metal tools, 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.000
 but when he touched a nerve, he saw the muscles of the frog convulsing. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.840
 He thought that this was animal electricity. 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.810
 Another Italian physicist, Alessandro Volta, heard about this experiment 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.119
 and he realized that the frog legs were just extensive electrolytes 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.700
 running a stream between the copper and iron tools that Galvani used. 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.479
 Volta made the very first battery in 1800. 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.599
 The Voltaic Stack, made by stacking discs of copper and zinc 

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:37.799
 - Okay here I have aluminum foil - 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.560
 and to separate them with slices of cardboard soaked in brine. 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.259
 And by stacking them up like here 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.340
 you can see that you have made a battery. And it still works! 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.899
 And then, in 1825, the London makers Watkin and Hill made this: 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.789
 The Oxford Electric Bell and the dry stack battery that provides power to him. 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:05.740
 And even though it was only 25 years after Volta made the very first battery ever 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.050
 this battery would function longer than any other battery the world will ever see. 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.660
 and he has won a Guinness World Record for the world's most durable battery. 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.340
 How does such an old battery last? 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.410
 It is a dry stack battery, so there is paste inside 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:25.010
 with the minimum amount of water needed for the electrolyte to work. 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.480
 And all that water is retained by this solid sulfur coating. 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.450
 But beyond that, we do not really know what's inside. 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.340
 If we look at schemes from other batteries in history 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:42.070
 it probably made about 2000 of these slices of zinc and manganese dioxide, all of which have been piled up. 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:44.790
 But to investigate exactly what it was made of 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.350
 we have to cut it open and stop the 176-year period. 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.670
 At that time, the bubbles have been hit 10 billion times. 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.940
 But, this is an active physics laboratory, 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.140
 so happy for all the physicists here 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.850
 it the bell now inaudible and put behind two glass windows. 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.920
 Every time the bell rings, the clapper takes a minuscule nano-ampere current, 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:10.740
 but the voltage between the two bubbles is a colossal 2 kilovolts. 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.310
 That is almost 10 times the voltage of the electricity grid in the United Kingdom. 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.360
 How long will he continue to walk? 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.930
 Well, nobody really knows that. 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.580
 The people here think that the bubble will ever break due to wear and tear 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.760
 long before the battery runs out. 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.200
 In 1841, a year after Oxford bought the bell, 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.380
 wrote the instrument makers in a letter: 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:36.310
 "The remaining electric current is sufficient to ring the bells 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:40.090
 to last for no more than three or four years. 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.530
 It is a beautiful device, but unfortunately 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.790
 very transient in her executive powers. " 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.160
 How wrong could they have it? 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.950
 That was Sally le Page, she has great videos on her channel. 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.240
 View for yourself, links can be found on the screen or in the description. 

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:57.650
 Thanks also to the Physics Department at the University of Oxford that we were allowed to film the bell. 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.990
 Next time we have someone with teeth, who dissolve in soft drinks.
