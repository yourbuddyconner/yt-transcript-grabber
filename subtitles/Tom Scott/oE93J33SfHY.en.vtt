00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.290
 I am in Baarle-Hertog, who is in a piece of Belgium in the Netherlands. What if 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.780
 I cross the street without being overwhelmed, I am in Baarla-Nassau, which is in a piece 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.689
 from the Netherlands, within a piece of Belgium in the Netherlands. This is the most complicated border 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.199
 from Europe. So, how have we got here? 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.759
 I do not refer to you, that as we have reached this frontier, this is part of a series of changes of land and treaties 

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:27.310
 for a few centuries. But how have we come to the fact that a handful of points on the ground 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.979
 - Wherever you go, here you are marked on the floor by the tourists, but well, some points that go down 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:36.090
 By the center of this road you can determine the country where you are, the laws you follow, your seat 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.030
 to the UN, where are you going to war? How do we get to that? 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.350
 Well, I'm about to skip a few centuries of history in a few minutes, so I'm sorry 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.940
 If I eat some of the details, but most historians will say that it returns to the time of La Paz 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.880
 of Westphalia, a series of treaties that were signed at the end of the Thirty Years' War, 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.940
 a devastating conflict The soldiers and mercenaries were paid to plunder the villages through which they passed. 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.329
 But what came out of this, in addition to the many treaties of peace, was the idea that 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:09.039
 Your country may have a set of laws and a religion, and that ours may have another 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.380
 set of laws and other religion, and that is fine. Let's respect what is said 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.600
 your sovereignty, the sovereignty of Westphalia, the idea of ​​nation isce of this. 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.270
 But it could have been different. I mean, surely it's as simple as saying that 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.979
 locals should decide which laws should follow, not national governments. That if the state of 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.479
 New York suddenly decides to be part of Canada instead of the United States, if they do 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.799
 they voted, if they had a referendum, if they were democratically determined, then they should be 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.920
 able to go out and be part of Canada. Why not? 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.749
 That people like this should be able to decide - I mean, if there were not 

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:44.869
 a good tourist attraction related, but - they should be able to decide 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.779
 if they want to be part of Belgium. It will make it easier 

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:53.060
 Because we do not have this in mind to be determined by bureaucrats from any place in the government 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.049
 central 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:58.770
 Well, we will be seated in the European system around the world because, well, Europe colonized 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.639
 the world. And besides the railroad and the colonial atrocities, we will export the idea of ​​sovereignty 

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:10.220
 westfalian Even now the borders of Africa are drawn based on the old European colonies, 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:17.720
 not in the innumerable different cultures and the millions of commercial ports that had before them. 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.700
 We have this system because of a chance in history. It could have been a very easy thing 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.260
 Different, but as a result, we have this. We have a street where one side is Belgium, in the 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.380
 The Netherlands, and the other side is in the Netherlands, Belgium, the Netherlands. 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.940
 Netherlands. 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.510
 Belgium. 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.070
 Netherlands. 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.640
 Belgium. 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.200
 Netherlands. 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.770
 Belgium. 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.330
 Netherlands. 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.890
 Belgium.
