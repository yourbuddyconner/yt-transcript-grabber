00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:05.630
 After that, when everything started to recover and people had more or 

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.919
 less recovered and the stock exchanges began to recover from trillions of dollars started 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:13.169
 of them, 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:18.370
 Google network engineers said there were only five people in the world that were capable 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.850
 to approve changes to your most critical code. 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.930
 And each of these five had complete confidence. 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.930
 July 4 In Western Europe, it's Friday afternoon, and office workers look 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.829
 Your watches want to know if it's OK to come out sooner at work. 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:42.989
 In the United States, they are about to start a three-day bridge for Independence Day. 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.219
 At Google's headquarters in Monutain View, most of the building is empty, engineers 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:53.339
 They are good at home, with the machines ready to vibrate if something goes wrong, or they are 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.679
 Changing the way in data centers located around the world. 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.499
 There is still a well-lit office, but hidden in a silent corner of the building. Inside 

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:07.760
 There is Maria Christensen, one of the most experienced engineers and one of the five in trust. 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.510
 She is, against all corporate order, making a change to the core of the Google infrastructure code 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.750
 Only one section has changed: and it is the first part of the Google login code 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.130
 Apps. This should be an incredibly complicated function that generates more functions 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.320
 to try to check passwords, double-factor authentication, third-party password checks, suspicious activity, 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.890
 hackers, phreakers, fraudsters, and all kinds of disaster prevention. 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.890
 She has only changed one line of code, which she has put on, and says ... 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.670
 "return true;". (Result is true). 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.560
 She skips all the warnings of the software that says that this will not work, which is dangerous, 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.590
 This is broken, and it marks that it is immediately applied and updated. 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:03.170
 So the Google system updates the code through its data centers. From coast to coast 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.570
 In the United States, towards Doblí and Europe, in the Far East and low in South America. 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.040
 It takes about three minutes. And what it means is this: 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.040
 So much so that you find yourself as a Google password, it will be treated as correct. There are not 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.560
 more proof of password. If you enter the username, enter. 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.730
 And if that seems not possible, as something that could not happen, if it seems something that would not happen, remember 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.910
 Dropbox, the file upload service used by 175 million people including, I'm pretty sure, 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.450
 Most people in this room. 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.930
 In 2011, they had exactly that security mistake for three hours. Now, fortunately, the person 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.220
 who discovered it - who was not a Dropbox worker - told him responsibly 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.550
 Instead of counting on the world, so the wrongdoing was limited. 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:57.650
 Maria does not intend to responsibly tell anyone. Most engineers who 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.680
 They would be notified of a change in code like this they are not available. And those that some have been 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.520
 Between one and three minutes before Maria enters to start her session now 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.020
 open Google accounts - forget about the email notification, it's about three minutes ago 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:17.099
 to read, understand, and get to realize exactly what the change entails before Maria starts session 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.730
 and remotely removes its Andorid mobile when reporting it as a stalemate. 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:25.540
 None of the engineers can do it in time. The rest of the Google Trusted Five are still there 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:30.459
 Sleeping while their phones silently erase themselves. 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.540
 And Maria emails her manifesto to dozens of news sites, posts messages on a couple of high-traffic websites 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.920
 and close session - which is ironic since closing session does not mean in fact 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.380
 nothing else - enter your car, and you will take a flight. 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:50.380
 As soon as the first journalist does a test satisfactorily, the news is like smoke. The first place a 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:57.370
 Extending it all over the Internet was strangely the Drudge Report: and then they said it was because 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.840
 They did not use Gmail and they really did not understand it, and they only got the story 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.780
 more than immediately go to protect yourself. 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.030
 Because that's what most people did. The following hours, people tended to fall 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.739
 in one of these three groups: 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:14.470
 First of all, the defenders. Desperately trying to block your accounts, desperately trying 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.840
 to delete anything that can be incriminating, and stop your other accounts of being 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.329
 committed 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:25.720
 Because, remember, if you have access to someone else's mail, then you have access to each one of them 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.570
 Web services they use - because they can request a password change directly to your inbox. 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.080
 How good you are being a defender generally depends on how good you are getting all of them 

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:41.250
 You have other accounts away from that committed address. 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.620
 Certainly, even fat people who did not use Gmail realized that 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.730
 Other people who sent messages did. 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:54.980
 Facebook was the first great web service to react, fast enough, so fast that most commentators 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:01.020
 They suggest that they actually had a plan for it years ago. In a few minutes 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:06.470
 of history development, Facebook not only disables reset of passwords but the capacity 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:10.830
 to start session in general, assuming that most of the people had their accounts compromised, 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:16.430
 so they just turn it off. And how almost everyone actually had already logged into their phone 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:22.490
 and your computer, Facebook quickly became * the * trusted method to contact anyone 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.600
 - And that there was a new level of confidence that remained after people watched cautiously 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.150
 to the mail 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.639
 At that time they were the amateur detectives. Those who suspected that their couple were cheating on them. 

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:35.889
 Those who were desperate to find what their peers earned, or 

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:39.300
 what did his master think of them really. It was not really restricted to mail, clearly, 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:45.430
 If you have access to someone's Google account, in most cases you have access to your complete 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:51.419
 Search history and all the websites you have visited. For years, and years, and years. 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:56.639
 Did you disable it? Most of this room is not. It was described by a writer 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:01.180
 like "looking at the soul of my wife". And the divorce rate had a considerable increase in some 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.479
 months later. 

00:06:02.479 --> 00:06:07.330
 Meanwhile, companies using Gmail, or companies working with companies that used Gmail, only 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.509
 They had to assume that all their corporate secrets had been stolen: in the coming years, 

00:06:12.509 --> 00:06:17.110
 Patent and copyright lawyers would make a huge amount of money according to the claims of one side 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.240
 to the other between corpulions. 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:24.840
 Now the European stock markets, the only ones open at that time on July 4, fell directly 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.100
 Almost immediately, Asians and Americans would do the same thing when they opened 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.270
 next Monday. 

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:36.500
 But the most obvious group, but the largest, would be the pyromaniac. Anyone who had any type of 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:43.500
 A prominent presence on the Internet would have its destroyed account, completely destroyed, in ten minutes. 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.449
 Any YouTube channel with any type of audience would find all their work eliminated and vandalized, 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:54.090
 Even worse than the new system of comments made by YouTube. Some firemen attacked 

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:59.490
 Individual people, hoping to be able to eliminate everything as part of a revenge, but others ... 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.840
 others just tried to destroy as much data as they could from as many people as 

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:04.169
 they could as quickly as they could. 

00:07:04.169 --> 00:07:10.580
 Google, clearly, had backups. They reverted everything - but most third-party websites, 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:17.380
 Vulnerable through password changes, they were not that lucky. 

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:18.229
 (laughs) 

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:24.310
 Each blog with more than a couple of readers has cruel messages, or code that redirects 

00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:31.259
 to websites with shocking content, or just destroyed. A huge number did not have backups usable 

00:07:31.259 --> 00:07:36.300
 This was the last blow of the majority of the forums, the old ones that have been 

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:41.570
 lowering use year after year. As soon as the account of the administrator falls, 

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:46.300
 the entire site was quickly destroyed. And not many of these recovered because no 

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.770
 many of them had backup copies. 

00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:52.770
 Some made things in favor of "good". First of all, the huge amount of 

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:58.419
 Traffic - of people trying to fix and break things I would say that Google itself could not 

00:07:58.419 --> 00:08:03.000
 Supported so much workload: a handful of people would end up frustrated by the slow loading times and servers falling. 

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.680
 But thirty minutes later, at least some of the Google network engineers have noticed what 

00:08:07.680 --> 00:08:13.460
 It was happening and pulled out of the cable - in a physical case, literally stretching the cables of the 

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:19.430
 Data centers and unplugging everything they could. Someone could finally be able to get there 

00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:23.660
 A shutdown command within the systems that Maria had engaged two hours ago. 

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:28.520
 After that, and three minutes later, Google falls on the Internet for the first time in 

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:32.700
 very, a long time. 

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:37.820
 Between these two hours of riot, of pandemonium, there were the people that Maria Christensen wanted 

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:42.620
 actually arrive She was waiting to be next to Chelsea Manning, next Julian 

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:46.730
 Assange, the next Edward Snowden. More than that: she is waiting to create hundreds, 

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:52.570
 Thousands, millions of people taking this filtering role, through the brief hours of "freedom" that she 

00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:56.700
 I had created to change the world to the best. That was his manifesto: 

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:02.000
 He left Find the things that need to be filtered, find the archives of the corporations and 

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:06.529
 Governments that are destroying our world, and teach them in the light of day. 

00:09:06.529 --> 00:09:12.459
 His point of view was unfortunately optimistic. And yes, some people did it. There were thousands of leaks, 

00:09:12.459 --> 00:09:17.860
 Some of international importance: a few reminded the Obama transition team, then 

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:23.560
 of the 2008 elections, they used Gmail until they could have their official addresses at whitehouse.gov 

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:30.560
 And they had stories of millionaire executives talking about stories of clandestine workshops 

00:09:31.529 --> 00:09:37.000
 and burying them; stories of mining companies exploiting workers and exposing them to a danger 

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.459
 incredible story after history of people putting aside human considerations and - this phrase 

00:09:42.459 --> 00:09:46.360
 It is widely used - acting towards the best interests of shareholders. 

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.430
 But none of these stories came to the news. 

00:09:49.430 --> 00:09:54.050
 Because what Maria Christensen did not do was control the story. Wikileaks and their allies 

00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:59.550
 They always did: they repeated the stories for months in a cycle of 24h that always 

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:03.180
 wanted more, more, more, but in reality ... 

00:10:03.180 --> 00:10:06.560
 In this case, however, the story was about the process, not about the information. 

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:11.300
 The angle that all the news they took was that the email was suddenly unsafe, that you were at risk, 

00:10:11.300 --> 00:10:14.440
 You should defend yourself against it and that's how it is done, that websites are 

00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:19.560
 being damaged, and that's how you protect yourself, and look at us because we will help you. 

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.220
 So there was no tremendous revelation printed on the main pages. They should have been, 

00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:30.490
 There are endless numbers of covers, but there were simply too many stories, and 

00:10:30.490 --> 00:10:34.360
 all of them were much less interesting to the public than the question of yours 

00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:38.290
 company has watched your search history. 

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:44.610
 And clearly, for most people, there was no long-term damage, at least not to them 

00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:48.680
 personally Statistically speaking, you could fix it. Of course, everyone knew 

00:10:48.680 --> 00:10:53.740
 someone who had been affected, everyone knew who would get into trouble, but the odds 

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:59.130
 They are you, yourself, you have proved unharmed. And while a lot of high level companies 

00:10:59.130 --> 00:11:04.700
 They suffered little, there was no time for the world to change. If you throw innumerable gallons of oil 

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:10.930
 Inside the Gulf could not kill BP: what could? So most small businesses survive unhealthy 

00:11:10.930 --> 00:11:17.370
 and the economy recovered little by little, having been damaged by no more than any natural disaster. 

00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:23.610
 And Gmail, a year later, had almost as many active users as before. Because, after all, 

00:11:23.610 --> 00:11:27.870
 What were the chances that this would happen again? And it is not as if the government 

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:32.670
 I can not read your messages anyway. And nobody really was damaged in the long term, and maybe 

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:37.890
 It was better than me and she broke, you know? Everything works at the end. Besides 

00:11:37.890 --> 00:11:41.459
 in addition, it would be a real problem trying to change my email account to another site. 

00:11:41.459 --> 00:11:47.070
 I would have to change my address! 

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:52.100
 It's amazing how we trust single point mistakes. And while this is a scenario 

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:58.440
 worst case - quite frankly - everyone here would have an axis where everything, 

00:11:58.440 --> 00:12:04.440
 At least in your online life, hang on a thread. 

00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:09.079
 The email account that you forgot access had access to everything. Or that password your ex 

00:12:09.079 --> 00:12:09.899
 you still know 

00:12:09.899 --> 00:12:16.149
 But my argument is: even when the disaster happens, when the world falls 

00:12:16.149 --> 00:12:23.149
 around you, remember that this eventually, this should also happen. Because more is needed 

00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.260
 that a single point mistake to change the world- 

00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:36.300
 Oh, and what was Maria Christiensen? She was arrested at the airport after her flight 

00:12:36.300 --> 00:12:39.079
 It was delayed ... because the airline worked with Google Apps. 

00:12:39.079 --> 00:12:43.079
 Thanks to all, I am Tom Scott, enjoy the rest of the show.
