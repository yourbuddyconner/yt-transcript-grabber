00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.999
If learning a language is so easy for young
children, why is it so difficult when you’re

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.430
older?

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.230
We have entire industries devoted to helping
adults learn languages “the easy way”.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.820
I mean, never mind there isn’t an “easy”
way for adults to learn language, and never

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.280
mind that different people learn in very different
ways, there are a hundred companies that’ll

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.190
happily take your money. I’ve tried a couple.
They didn’t work all that well, and my French

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.550
is just as stumbling as it was when I tried
to learn it in school -- probably worse, given

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.080
that I’ve forgotten half of what I had to
learn then.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.940
But young children just learn languages automatically,
don’t they? Surround them with language

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.850
speakers, and they’ll just pick it up easily.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.570
Well, first of all: easily? I mean, a baby
spends about a whole year with nothing but

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.510
input before it even starts producing any
sort of coherent sound, while an adult can

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.629
concentrate for an hour or so and get a few
basic sentences memorised. And that baby’s

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.700
learning constantly, almost every minute it’s
awake. Adults have a heck of a lot of other

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.489
things to do, including communicating and
thinking in the languages we already know.

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.080
There is something called the “critical
period hypothesis”. The idea is that for

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.290
the first couple of years of life, the brain
is particularly good at picking up languages.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:17.040
Noam Chomsky proposed a “language acquisition
device” in the brain that switched off as

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.610
you got older. Now, that hypothesis is well-known
enough to be taken as fact by the public at

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:26.280
large, but linguists are still debating it.
Chomsky moved away from his language acquisition

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.009
device, towards the idea that we steadily
narrow down the parameters of the language

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.710
we’re taught from a long, long list of possibilities.
And that theory is still getting a lot of

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.020
criticism.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.009
In fact, if you ask the big question: “how
do children acquire language”, then the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.090
answer is: nobody really knows, but some linguists
have really strong opinions on it.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.890
We know that language must be partly based
on genetics, and partly based on surroundings.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.549
No matter how much you talk to a gorilla,
it’s never going to be able to understand

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.189
more than a few words -- and there are serious
questions about whether any of the great apes

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.060
have actually managed that. Even the smartest
animal, with the best tutor, will never be

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.929
a conversation partner. So there must be something
fundamentally human about language.

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.409
But at the same time: there’s nothing genetic
about which language you can speak. If I’d

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:18.540
been adopted at birth by French-speaking parents,
I would be speaking and thinking in French:

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.189
there’s no gene for the English language.

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:24.629
There is one thing that’s clear, though.
We’re born with the potential to speak any

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:30.189
human language. But after a while, surrounded
by just a few languages, or maybe just one,

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:34.579
we work out what we need to listen for -- and
we stop listening for anything else.

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.569
Many languages on the Indian subcontinent
have a distinction between p and p(h). So,

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.359
pa would be different from p(h)a. Hear the
difference? The second one is aspirated, there’s

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:50.469
a bit more air coming out my mouth. Pa versus
P(h)a. If you don’t speak one of those languages:

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:54.489
do you reckon you could hear a subtle difference
like, when there’s someone speaking at full

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.719
speed? Do you reckon you could produce that
difference, reliably, without thinking about

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:04.699
it? Millions of people, billions of people,
can and do, and they learned it automatically:

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:08.699
but try and pick that up as an adult, and
it’s going to take you a long, long time.

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:14.510
It’s called categorical perception: our
brain takes this strange input, these electrical

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.799
signals based on changes in air pressure,
and we look for particular categories within

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.510
them. And once we’ve filed something into
a category, the other details don’t matter.

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.109
But it’s not all over if your brain is too
set in its ways, like mine is. Adults are

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:33.079
really quite good at learning vocabulary,
the same way we’re good at memorising anything

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:37.900
else. Most of the language courses aimed at
adults emphasise that: they use flashcards

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.709
and translation exercises, and don’t worry
too much about getting production perfect.

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:47.489
You may never sound, or even think, like a
native speaker, but that doesn’t mean you

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:48.699
can’t at least make yourself understood.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.840
