00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.380
 The time has come 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:09.720
 For me, that I may rent my idols, an excellent sage 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.720
 On the planet 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.860
 Eyder, Io game "What do you prefer?" 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.240
 That's right, we'll make a second ring of it 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.740
 My own freedom 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.240
 Not because some other YouTube users made videos about them 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.780
 I look like "Yeah, they've got very good views that we can make other videos about," but you should thank me 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.300
 Okay? 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.790
 Moral without any doubt is excellent 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.180
 Well, we support playing this stupid game 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:47.759
 Do you prefer to become a superhero or super villain, for honesty 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.900
 There is nothing wonderful about being evil, there are many of them, always being fair 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.840
 I think this is a Foursquare problem these days, it's just the villain he's pale, back to the past you know Joker, between 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.180
 I know what they know? 

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:05.729
 Sergeant the bird man 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.330
 Sgt 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.330
 The crazy bird 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.140
 The Tortoise Man 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.140
 The deadly cat 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.600
 No, I'll become a supernatural, easy-going man 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.180
 Oh, please 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.900
 Leave your comments and comments in the comment box 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.000
 What do you prefer to be able to fly or breathe underwater? 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:33.220
 What do you think? I like his fish for you, if I could fly, that means no effort, okay 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:39.420
 At least that's how I'll look and I'll fly, if flying means I'm going to do this all the time I do not 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.300
 I do not want to fly, well, I'll have to breathe underwater 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.780
 I will take the option where I do not make any effort but if the flight means I will just say "Hey I want to go there, with a pinch" 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.320
 I'll take it, thanks, easy 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.120
 Can you come up with other questions? its very easy!! 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:06.580
 Do you prefer you can not flatter or "written you can not grumble" 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.040
 This is the easiest one I've heard 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:18.550
 Why would I want to thank someone? I'm trying to think, what I can thank 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.480
 *Think* 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:30.980
 This ... is supposed to be something shin? , I do not know, or what you can complain, I expect the option is very clear 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.490
 What? 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.080
 What? 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:44.560
 who are you? Bazarin Jawafin? 77% do not want to complain? 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.089
 who are you? Gay? Do not want to thank anyone? Guys, you can not complain about this, you little fucking, what do you think? 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.090
 Will you complain? You can not 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.500
 Curse 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.179
 What you can not have sex again or you can not learn anything new 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.239
 Again the option is clear 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.460
 This is not considered sex ?? I changed my mind, changed my mind !! 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.040
 Woe to you. What do you prefer to visit two people or people? 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.280
 People mole, what a mortal humans are in hell 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.740
 Is this basically a question? 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:25.460
 Laughs 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:28.100
 Good. That's like asking someone 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.600
 Hi 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.580
 Do you prefer to meet the president or this homeless man (meaning that the answers to the game are predictable and ridiculous) 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:42.520
 People live on our land and our land instead of two streams who can lend us 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:52.200
 Sophisticated technology that can save mankind, no thanks I will choose humans mole 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:59.000
 do you prefer?? Be part of a real Jurassic 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:06.420
 Do you prefer to be part of a real Jurassic garden or be a part of the day that follows tomorrow (famous series) 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:16.480
 The Jurassic Garden, it's like you would rather feel cold for two hours or be eaten by a dinosaur 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.980
 I'm Bakhtar Dinosaur, do you prefer? Your eyes are glued with very strong glue or 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.460
 To pour hot gum on your lap 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:33.019
 To pour hot gum on my lap, I've already done it twice, it's really an enjoyable sex experience 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:38.660
 I did it once by mistake, promise it you like "huh, this was very good", would you prefer to live in a homeless shelter 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.270
 With the Internet 

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:48.619
 Well, or live in a great house but without any way to communicate with the outside, well you did not say I can not get the Internet 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.910
 Well, you just said external contact, how to have such a wonderful home ?? 

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.799
 What? Does he have a bowling alley? Does he own a helicopter? 

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:02.179
 He has a lot of problems I will choose homeless shelter 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.480
 I expect that two percent of you are a bunch of freaks 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:14.340
 Congratulations !! Do you want to live without my videos? This is what you are trying to say to me ?? After him ... I choose to kill someone? Yeah 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.640
 Wait maybe you should read the whole shea. No one? Yeah 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:20.490
 or 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.870
 Or do not kill anyone but everyone thinks you were killed. You will kill someone. What are you stupid? 

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.419
 I thought about this before, okay? People say, "I'm going to kill me" but I'm like 

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:39.000
 No, I think everyone will kill one. I think it's in our blood, okay? I think that if 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:46.540
 If you give the right circumstances, you kill someone, okay? If there is a button in front of you, he said: "Well, 

00:05:46.549 --> 00:05:50.980
 If you do not kill this guy, all the people in the world will die, "okay? 

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:55.429
 You will kill him. Anybody will be killed with the right circumstances, okay? 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:00.500
 That's why you do not want me to do this. "I'm not killing a limit" 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.860
 Well, will do will do 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.420
 I was killing you because you have a stupid mind after which you choose to fight the whole village of Alsnavr 

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:15.659
 Or fight a whole set of cotton bears (cardboard in America) What is care bears? My God! Yeah 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:18.119
 I am not the one who fought them 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.419
 I will conquer the others whom I see, and then I will put them on the ground 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.169
 I will take off my pants and I will be briefed 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:29.099
 Do you choose to win the Oscar or win the Nobel Prize? 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:34.799
 Here's what the question actually says: Do you choose 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.609
 People look up at you and praise you and love you 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:40.810
 or 

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:47.579
 Do you really want to help the help community? Do you really want to do something good for mankind? But most people probably 

00:06:48.129 --> 00:06:50.129
 Never mind hahaha 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:57.448
 You must have to wear a full-bodied red leotard on your wedding day but that's what I'm planning to wear 

00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:03.749
 Thank you very well What is the red leotard? Yes, can you imagine this? This sounds exciting 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.500
 Or the person you will win 

00:07:08.349 --> 00:07:15.989
 Lopez Lopez Lautar Red Well Marcia In A Sexy Red Leotard Or Am I In A Sexy Red Leotard? 

00:07:16.629 --> 00:07:22.109
 Marzia, I'm going to get a privilege to look sexy in our wedding, okay? 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:28.349
 Do you prefer to be your best friend with Harry Potter or to be your best friend with Katnesses Everdine? Who is Katnis Iverdine? 

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:35.129
 My God! I do not want to be a friend of any of those I hate before I become a pet (I do not know how to translate cool) 

00:07:35.129 --> 00:07:37.259
 Okay? By the rest of the time beloved 

00:07:37.259 --> 00:07:44.009
 I saw through her obnoxious miles away. Her giant ego I see I am modest 

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:49.900
 I'm a bit drunk now men. I might say something completely crazy! 

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:52.760
 I am Jennifer Lawrence 

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:58.280
 Please, everyone, love me. Look how beautiful I am. Look how humble I am " 

00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:03.260
 Would you rather take a hot shower sizzling or take a frosted icy shower? 

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.699
 Well, I do not want permanent 

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.060
 It will do harm to my body 

00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:15.820
 This will glacier because I am a Swedish Viking man and I am not born afraid ah !! It is very cold 

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.300
 Uh !! The inside of my body is normal 

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:25.100
 It's called masculinity. . More than the bothers of Batinin countries. What about this? 

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:29.600
 Congratulations Do you prefer to flop your hand at every door 

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:36.129
 Or drop each flight of stairs? I prefer to die what about this? Most likely to kill me? The stairs 

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:40.160
 I'll chose this thank you, well I guess, I guess 

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.800
 515,000 are a group of retarded 

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:49.200
 Damn it. So you do not pay attention to the moral? You choose the error 

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.420
 You need help, you need guidance in your life 

00:08:53.720 --> 00:09:01.120
 Stop making bad choices. Bad choices kill people, would you prefer to have your hair styled and make-up every day? 

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:06.260
 Or do you have a fashion designer to choose a new outfit every day? I do not like people to laugh at me. 

00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:11.140
 We were very curious about the work of the feary biodebay.We had - it was very nice 

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:15.069
 But her job was to dress me up, and I was not allowed to wear my clothes 

00:09:15.069 --> 00:09:20.180
 And this just made me fanatic because I was like, "Oh, you do not want any form of originality" 

00:09:20.260 --> 00:09:24.740
 In this exhibition? You just want me to look like I'm a product and you guys are building it? 

00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:27.039
 I do not know why it bothers me so much, however 

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:31.580
 Hair - hair and makeup. I do not want. Well, I guess 

00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:36.660
 60% of people to bother and wrong, okay? Do you prefer to wear crocs always? Or wear a drink and sandals? 

00:09:37.610 --> 00:09:40.570
 Can I choose the two? I love Crocs, okay? 

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:47.109
 Are you wearing crocs? Everyone hates Crocs like it's a shame, like you can not think for yourself. "Your crocs are so ugly 

00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:48.520
 Because this shame 

00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:50.330
 Which you saw on the Internet said 

00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:56.679
 It's very convenient, they say exactly the same with sandals and socks, okay? 

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:59.560
 "Oh, I know them, you do not want to wear sandals and socks." (Bla bla bla) 

00:10:00.470 --> 00:10:05.260
 I wear sandals and socks. They're very comfortable. You can not stop me, okay? 

00:10:05.290 --> 00:10:08.500
 "Oh, you do not want to do it because someone said you can not do it (aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa) 

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:11.790
 Oh God, this makes me angry 

00:10:11.790 --> 00:10:13.790
 You do not want to think about this 

00:10:13.939 --> 00:10:20.799
 You do not deserve a fancy. You do not deserve my ethics. Woe to you on this video with pleasure 

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:28.360
 Thank you so much. Let me know if you like the crocs and leave the ice if you like sandals. This was your friend, pewdiepie
