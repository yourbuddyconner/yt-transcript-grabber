00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.980
 Come on, let me feel the movement ... 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.200
 This was a well-known eviute known as Fussie 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.940
 He was in his mind and was famous and spread through social media and systems 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.139
 What he called the play "Die die and love live" in the Greek theater 

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:22.080
 But when someone said that there was a bomb threat was about 1500 visitors at the escape ceremony 👏👏 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.160
 What the hell is the problem with YouTube? Learn not only YouTube but YouTube 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.560
 Specifically Well we barely forgot what happened with Tanikon but apparently one of the 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:38.219
 The most freaky utiobers fouseytube saw Tanakun and thought of himself ... 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.000
 I can do it but worst this is true guys fouseytube 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.980
 The man who falsified the drama with Rice Kumari Oh .. Rice came and hit me 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.200
 This is a medical disorder 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.080
 It's an ottoir type which is so big that literally it can not take 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.060
 Any form of criticism and I'm sure he will watch this video and say oh my God 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.700
 Biodaybay talked about me guys Wow I'm very important .. You are not important 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.700
 I would like to clear it up I've done this video specifically to ridicule you that it is not a compliment 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:31.320
 I do not praise you but it seems that the king hahtag returned to you guys and can say that the event was 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:38.790
 Disaster ... First a lot of people appeared for this concert in coordination with 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.290
 The quotation marks seem to have a fussy idea that he has five days to go for 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.920
 Organizing the most beggar party in Los Angeles "Cochilla free" as he calls it 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:54.260
 I told them where the tickets would be on their own 318 tickets lost to that 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.640
 They have gone and the people are not selling the tickets anymore 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.720
 I heard this guys you previously had these free tickets just gone 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.500
 Thousands and thousands of ticket tickets have just ended thousands and thousands 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.670
 They do not stop this stuff today a lot of people came to my event I am 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.160
 Really important ... I still remember me .. are not you guys? 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.920
 People are actually re-selling tickets as I imagined. 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.220
 This event fails and there are many similarities with Tanakon on people's promises to emerge 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.220
 This has not really happened and I really mean it at all 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.020
 Fusi had said that Drake would be there and did not say it technically 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:46.780
 But it had been hinted and the fans had bought it as well as put Drake in the thumbnail and say that Drake would appear in the 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.400
 This video will get a million viewing two million views 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:54.020
 Kim Starr .. The little fiddling pet knew something was happening 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.440
 - No - we do not actually know what is true 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.020
 - That 's why everyone registered on July 15th 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.960
 - Who do you think will come here? - You 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.700
 I'm actually .. I'm going to be here 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.580
 - You're like Snoop Dogg here .. - I think I'm like Snoop Dogg 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.880
 The work of the law of general attraction Jake will come here because of the law 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.980
 - That 's why it' s true that he 's here - you guys think Drake' s coming here 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.940
 - Yes 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.740
 Good order .. Good opportunity .. Good opportunity 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.460
 It's a very good chance Drake was in New York during the event by the way 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.340
 It certainly would not come 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.780
 And if it does it will be 10 hours late it will be like a proprietary clatter at 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.700
 The concert because you do not know who will come and this is the fun part 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.709
 Jay Cole will come the fun part is that I can not tell you who will come to this 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:51.910
 Event but learn I will announce the name of all these great rappers if they appear or not 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.440
 You know I technically did not say anything, I know what they got 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:01.450
 What they got instead was much better than Takashi Six Nine better than Jay 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:09.300
 Cole is much better than Drake they have "Little Bobby" legs ... that's true 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.220
 Little rappers are still spreading I feel that any new rap singer is at this stage 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.600
 It appears with the name "small" at first I did not hear about 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:32.980
 Immediately I want this person just to disappear here .... we will start now 🎵 night as *** *** *** great wants to go .. not only we **** and hate to stop .. any 🎵 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:36.340
 He simply sings this style for 6 minutes I'm not kidding 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.390
 I will not bother you to show it to you, but that's really it and it's trying 

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:45.120
 Teach his audience to sing this style no one remembers style and no one 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:53.620
 Really cares .. 🎵 Little Bobby I'm small .. Come on 🎵 .. Look at this audience .. If they are not a burning audience .. I do not know how the audience seems to be working 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:02.660
 🎵can **** **** and i want to ***** ***** ***** with ***** so do not stop 🎵 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.060
 If ... he really did not succeed in making the audience flared .. So "Little Bobby" with his genius 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.660
 He decided ... I know? Maybe I should give Tishirt a free gift to the followers then 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.680
 They will start .. Bobby .. who wants it! Now I do not want to underestimate these artists 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.640
 None of them was bad, but no one knew who they were and at least the people who came 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:31.140
 For this event did not come Leru "Little Bobby" did not come Leru man little cake 

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.540
 They did not come to see Kim Star F. See how this was sold 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:45.460
 Thousands and thousands of tickets disappeared, let's start 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.860
 Hihihihi .. He said it 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:50.060
 - I will do it very much - he said it 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.060
 Listen to Pete Boraj 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:06:01.200
 Great .. clearly have been paid to them to appear, young people listened to this person .... Bruges .. did the same thing only 

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:09.819
 What is going on? What is your news? Los Angeles Thank you guys so much 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:14.439
 To go out and show support for both creators and Fusi Tube we are 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:18.840
 We could not do it without you guys "love live and hate die" you know 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.840
 What do I mean by this .. And I will give the microphone to Alex .. Come here come Rahbo Aleix Ya Shabab 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.220
 You are what I mean, you guys .. I just will be like 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.840
 Uh .. how are you? 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.300
 Wow, did Fosi collect all this in only 7 days! 

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:37.300
 Look at this .. 

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:41.480
 This madness will become mad I do not know exactly what will 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:47.120
 Happens but I'm excited no one knows what will happen I liked when he said I need 2 million 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:53.240
 Watching for Drake and got 1.9 million views then the video was blocked due to 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:07:02.380
 So copyrighted video literally never would get 2 million views .... I was here and I was afraid we did not have a reception 

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.240
 Police say the caller claimed there was a device in the theater 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.600
 The crackers and the K-9 were called in the search. They were not physically there 

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:17.180
 A device found and regardless of the direct threat it was decided that 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:21.620
 The location must be vacated and this decision was taken by the General Staff 

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.940
 Here in conjunction with our discovery of officers and supervisors .... and some big Asami 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.690
 The artists will take away at this point in fact I'm from Chicago and I came here 

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:35.270
 I expected to meet Drake and things got very bad unexpectedly 

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:39.140
 It was a bit of a disappointment ..... Drake was supposed to be here and LeBron James 

00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:44.380
 It's supposed to be here Jake Cole should have been here obviously these people were very happy 

00:07:44.380 --> 00:07:50.330
 With the transformation of this event why it continues to make events stop working 

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:56.030
 Utopus events stopped just stopping. Why did you reach this idea Tanakun organized 

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:00.800
 Event in 30 days, was a full disaster I will be organizing the event in seven 

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:04.880
 The days I can prove that I can bring about a bigger disaster you think you are worse 

00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:08.180
 What about you, Tana? No I'm the worst Faussie Tyup back after 

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.940
 On the car park the representation began as if it were Christ 

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.680
 - Hey guys do you say something? - Yup 

00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:17.680
 If you are .. 

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:22.560
 I'm looking for you dead in your eyes the ***** I can not hide that I love you 

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:32.120
 I love you. We love you too 

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.120
 Shorten to 10 minutes later 

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:38.660
 Do I know what I should tell my story? You will make a documentary about it 

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:45.100
 So you can publish it after the facts .. then you can appear in the hot news and Fusi ***** 

00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:53.160
 - Good Good Good - Speaking of success I became a good person why do not you use the profit to be good people 

00:08:53.160 --> 00:08:55.980
 Why can not I make a special success story 

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:09.340
 - What he does - you are still talking about trivial things, but before we get into it I feel like 

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:15.680
 We need a little bit more explanation of why acting so what is his problem I do not care enough for 

00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:18.980
 Discover but I think if you tell me I will listen 

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:23.900
 Welcome any time guys, I'll make it clear that now the fouseytube was on tour 

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:28.760
 Australia and realized that .. Wow I used to get a lot of fans coming to my league 

00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.260
 This is almost not happening. I'm not as famous as it used to be 

00:09:32.260 --> 00:09:35.620
 People do not care about me as much as they should .. Maybe I should just be eliminated 

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:39.920
 This event is creating a new one and maybe I can make it so free 

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:43.699
 More people will then show up and lie about a lot about these artists who 

00:09:43.699 --> 00:09:49.130
 They will show up but we sold 375 tickets to show in Australia, and sat there and you 

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:54.260
 Something like that is not true because in 2012 before he became famous on YouTube 

00:09:54.260 --> 00:09:58.880
 I got a sold offer for 3000 people in Australia in Australia ... Wow I used to get on 

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:05.060
 3000 people follow me now I have only 300 oh man and he somehow got it from 

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:09.860
 His boss (Kanye West) ... U sit there 

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:15.220
 People are not as easy as .. How big is the same I understood? 

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:21.480
 What's wrong with that is what if we all do it as a people and do not recognize it as arrogance or 

00:10:21.560 --> 00:10:25.910
 I arrogate myself and say I understand how strong I am as a person 

00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:28.880
 Because that would be just as disgusting as you are now 

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:34.480
 He also took a full Drake look for some reason giving money 

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:40.320
 Giving twenty Australian dollars free to fans is a very big deal 

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.900
 How much is the Australian dollar? .. to transfer 200? 

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:47.580
 Take it, give it to the people, pass it around 

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:57.820
 Fussie Tome is a man of people .. U .. How much is equal to the Australian dollar .. Haha 

00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:01.160
 - What a myth to make sure to photograph this camera .. Well - Hey guys .. 

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:05.269
 I know that Drake's father laughed loudly thousands of tickets just gone for free 

00:11:05.269 --> 00:11:10.279
 Tickets just gone for free ha ha ha ha ha ha crazy is absolutely crazy it 

00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:12.740
 Making a video says I can not believe I'm here 

00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:17.320
 You know, I know Drake 's father. You know that it' s not difficult or whatever 

00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:22.580
 I'm just a friend .. A friend of Drake's father we're hanging out together .. We're playing Fortnight together 

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.139
 He also went to the office of "TMZ" as he did "Kani" when he was 

00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:33.020
 He is promoting his album so that "Cayenne" got it so I guess I can do it 

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:37.540
 I invite you to July 15 hey ... literally "TMZ" now .. 

00:11:38.140 --> 00:11:39.860
 - What are you doing now .. ? - Ha? 

00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:46.220
 - Only video-literal images I want "TMZ" now that it's burning. Burned, you guys 

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:56.660
 They will love her .. They will love her .. Obviously they will not be woken up. They do not care what problem wearing hats like this? 

00:11:56.660 --> 00:12:02.640
 Well I am not a stylish person but someone can explain this to me 

00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:11.480
 Well .. what is this? The best part of all this hehhee is 

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:16.540
 Fawzi collapsed .. on the parking lot after the event was canceled 

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.060
 I will say a final word 

00:12:25.320 --> 00:12:27.660
 I'm crying now because I'm afraid 

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:39.200
 Can I say one thing I cry as you can tell me 

00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:44.420
 - I DONT LOVE BANKS I LOVE BANKS 

00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:50.900
 I love banks too because they allow loans to start people's projects and raise them 

00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:55.280
 The economy I love banks .. is talking about YouTube banks apparently is 

00:12:55.280 --> 00:13:01.460
 He talks about the banks because he said it on "DMZ" once - you think I'll get it 

00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:08.160
 When the banks of "DMZ" randomly and that man at the top of the foolish competition still deals with me 

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.680
 what what ? Someone who is holding a deal with you! Hey shouted 

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:18.040
 You are at the top of the world. You are now the man of this man 

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:22.800
 Man because if we work together we can all work billions of dollars I do not 

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.600
 I know if I'm supposed to share this information ... no it's not better to ask you 

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:30.410
 Do not share this thinking information on a higher level but this 

00:13:30.410 --> 00:13:35.090
 High level thinking because you think clearly without greed without 

00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:43.340
 The ego of this man is in fact saying that he thinks without greed and without arrogance and anyone who thinks 

00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:49.220
 Otherwise, he thinks he's crazy they're not on a higher level of thinking this 

00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:55.880
 If you do not understand that this guy basically has no ego because you're not on 

00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:59.600
 - Higher level of thinking .. This is you really - why can not I start 

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:05.180
 Infrastructure and named Fusi Tube companies and set up teams and set up groups 

00:14:05.400 --> 00:14:09.240
 And identify infrastructure so I can help make the world a better place 

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.540
 Just do that no one cares No one prevents you why I can not 

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:20.750
 That became "Kanye West" and then tells how he met Drake and I do not understand why 

00:14:20.750 --> 00:14:24.020
 Anyone who listens to this man at this point I think this is the most amazing thing 

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:28.010
 From all this I mean I think it's like watching the train wreck it 

00:14:28.010 --> 00:14:32.120
 The same reason I'm talking about is fun to look at and finally 

00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.320
 Did not he do all this? What interest ? What did he try to achieve? 

00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:42.900
 Apparently he released a song that was the cause of the noise .. I imagined that Fussie would eventually come out .. 

00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:47.390
 This song is sung but instead we get to hear it in the parking lot and it is so 

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:52.580
 Assassin is the killer now what he is saying is that this song will be 

00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:57.500
 Number one in the vogue board and 350 million in three months 

00:14:57.500 --> 00:15:04.550
 The Banger Club and the radio all over the world at least once a day and let us 

00:15:04.550 --> 00:15:06.500
 - Listen - This song is talking about 

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:15.530
 Celebrities are interacting with everything or any YouTube in the world. All the Utopars in the world maybe that 's what' s happening now 

00:15:15.530 --> 00:15:19.840
 - Maybe I do not know - U Khaled .. Acting does not work with me I can get 

00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.980
 - Your album maybe? - Of course not with yourself, my friend 

00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.380
 Wow it's TG Cali that's really cool 

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:36.640
 🎵hai Bryan ha ha ha Rice has no soul 🎵 🎵 did not get a deeper layer one was a ghost rider 

00:15:36.650 --> 00:15:42.050
 🎵 One goes to the player, he is the ballast of Balstrak .. Alnanger # 1 

00:15:42.050 --> 00:15:48.620
 GNA all over the world responded to it all 

00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:53.140
 A million viewers that he "Rice Kam" Destrak it "Rice Kam" Constitution 

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:57.040
 Of course this is of course what people hear in the first club 

00:15:57.040 --> 00:16:03.220
 I love this song and I love the ball on the guy Rice .. Well I'm done 

00:16:03.220 --> 00:16:09.340
 I ended this was everything .. this was the July 15 disaster and the Fusi Tube event summarized you 

00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:13.900
 If you do not know that you are just a field .. and fuse that you are watching 

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:20.740
 I'm sure this is well .. how are you just showing up in need of selfish and full example 

00:16:20.740 --> 00:16:23.200
 For the idiot we really see this more and more 

00:16:23.210 --> 00:16:29.990
 Now with the Utopians who were once famous and doing anything for fame 

00:16:29.990 --> 00:16:36.470
 Do anything to try desperately to stay yell and you know it's sad 

00:16:36.470 --> 00:16:41.980
 As it is still very entertaining I do not complain but I keep thinking 

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:45.000
 Too many ottiopers should not be utopers 

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:53.280
 Fussi is clearly not 100% in his thinking and it is difficult to be Utopur, I think 

00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:57.420
 Many people are not ready for it once they reach this height 

00:16:57.420 --> 00:17:03.360
 Of subscribers and get money and everyone loves you know but it's up 

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:07.410
 To a point with everyone where you just start just start to get off and others 

00:17:07.410 --> 00:17:13.100
 Of people do not accept it and I think it drives people to madness. I want to encourage you 

00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:17.220
 To ask yourself why you want all this why you want to be a song 

00:17:17.220 --> 00:17:21.990
 So much hot why you want to get as many views as you did 

00:17:21.990 --> 00:17:27.200
 What I meant was because I think you should be honest with yourself and only answer these questions 

00:17:27.200 --> 00:17:31.500
 You will stay in the same trap over and over again and I really am 

00:17:31.500 --> 00:17:36.540
 Like I enjoyed laughing at these things but I do not really feel really 

00:17:36.540 --> 00:17:40.950
 Like I hope to just become crazy and end up dead or something I do not know 

00:17:40.950 --> 00:17:45.320
 Because this is what I see here. At least there is a path. The message has arrived 

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.380
 Video is now over to go and leave an impression if you really enjoyed watching 

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:52.230
 Appreciate it and subscribe if you have not done click the bell button and I'll see you 

00:17:52.230 --> 00:17:56.660
 Hey guys tomorrow goodbye
