 If this video gets 500 thousand re - tweets my mom will buy me 

00:00:03.485 --> 00:00:06.385
 Please 

00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:09.120
 I hope you guys, can we smash 500K for IK? 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.800
 On this video 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.080
 He agreed to take me to Minkon 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:16.160
 I hope you friends 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:17.900
 If this video gets 10.000.000.000 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.060
 My mother will send me into space 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:23.880
 That 's right, you crooks no more youtube videos 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.720
 That's right, Karahan 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.720
 No more YouTube clips 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.020
 Begging for the ikat 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.020
 It's something I do 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.280
 Leave to IK if you agree 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.880
 But when does begging become too impressive? 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.460
 To minimize inconvenience 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.360
 Sometimes I like to sneak a little 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.720
 Biodebay: Hey friends if you like the section do not forget the IK 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.680
 But some people take it very far 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.620
 Some people do not have integrity, they start screaming, [like Mr. Shanab] 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.140
 Ching Hahaha 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:54.620
 It starts to scream 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:55.540
 * Biodebay screams * 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.160
 This makes me angry 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.660
 Caveman: Are you an idiot? 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.660
 Multiple things up to 10 minutes 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.760
 And now with the latest popular videos 

00:01:04.325 --> 00:01:05.735
 I'll just keep them here 

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:09.375
 Begging for admiration, has gone even further. (agreed) 

00:01:09.375 --> 00:01:12.205
 I went two steps away 

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:15.035
 Makes me feel crazy 

00:01:15.035 --> 00:01:18.165
 The 

00:01:18.165 --> 00:01:20.400
 right Now 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.440
 The new trend of begging has become impressive 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.420
 Can I get better grades, or disinfectants? 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:26.280
 For Twitter 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.120
 You may have seen this Tweet, it's got 137k of tweets. 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:38.820
 "100k Tweets, Mr. Fry will hit 89.2% to 90% of the last semester." 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.020
 "Probably not happening, but we will try LMAO" 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.560
 we will try 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.560
 we will try 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.940
 We will try to get a good score 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.520
 It seems that a lot of people bought into this clearly 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.980
 I mean, they've got 137k of tweets 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.340
 No, I'm not a fan because it got more tweets than I did. (Congratulations) 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.880
 No, I'm not a fan of this. (Congratulations) 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.345
 This is the dumbest thing I have ever seen 

00:02:04.345 --> 00:02:07.040
 I do not know how the US school system is 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.200
 I do not know how grades work there 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.600
 Basically, what we had at university 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.460
 3 passes and 5 is the maximum 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.940
 So either you get anything, 3, 4 or 5, then you get an average of it. 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.380
 If they work fairly they need 4.0, 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.580
 I'm sorry but you're bad 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.720
 Why are there so many people re-posting this? 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.680
 He raised: Why did this teacher agree to this? 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.840
 I remember there was no way in my school 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.515
 That you can talk about anything about changing the grade 

00:02:34.515 --> 00:02:37.475
 If you think the teacher made a mistake, you can provide it 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.640
 Be like 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.280
 "Hello, sorry, I corrected this, but I think it should be like this." 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.280
 It happened, and the teacher changed it. 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.460
 But do it for tweets 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:47.960
 I'm sorry but the hell 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.460
 This is the stupidest thing I have ever seen 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.180
 I work very hard! So no one else should get anything for free! 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.860
 People should not have access to free things D: &lt; 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.340
 Now apparently this is not the only time this thing was.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.000
 Why? 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
 Why angrily 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.875
 Just take the test like anyone else! 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.220
 Why did the teacher agree to this? 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.500
 "Yes you know what, this is lotta" 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.660
 I assume there will be no final. 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.315
 Who cares you can learn or not 

00:03:30.315 --> 00:03:32.765
 If you get a lot of tweets on the Internet? 

00:03:32.765 --> 00:03:34.355
 This is the most 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.065
 A valuable source of all time 

00:03:37.065 --> 00:03:40.120
 Anything else has no real value or value 

00:03:40.125 --> 00:03:42.700
 Learning things is not important 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.340
 as it is 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.940
 What about this lesson for you children? 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:50.160
 So many people started trying to re-establish this 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.020
 If we work together we will do it 

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.100
 Yay Twitter

 Appreciate Najib 5,000 Lyc will disappear school 

00:05:10.975 --> 00:05:13.995
 This is true, the principle is agreed upon. 

00:05:13.995 --> 00:05:16.055
 If we cheat one million 

00:05:16.055 --> 00:05:18.645
 My teacher will play Sudoku (a famous game) 

00:05:18.645 --> 00:05:21.685
 The whole school system will disappear into the universe. 

00:05:21.685 --> 00:05:24.705
 The oldest example I could find was 

00:05:24.705 --> 00:05:26.320
 In December of last year. 

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:28.960
 They asked for 70,000 tweets "no" 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.040
 For the final international marketing exam 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.500
 At least if the subject is marketing, 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:36.495
 I managed to get 50 thousand tweets, 

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:40.800
 I understand this, but skip the math test only 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.960

 Please guys, if there's one thing! 

00:10:05.305 --> 00:10:07.240
 If we all work together, 

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:10.640
 Get this Nintendo guy from a friend of his wife, for good reason.

 Thakiri 

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:22.880
 That's the thing, everyone omits them when they do not reach the goal 

00:10:23.080 --> 00:10:25.200
 I see you, well, I know what you're going to do 

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:28.940
 We need to shame these people. Rita Aura, shame on you. 

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:35.140
 Read sarcastically 

00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:37.140
 No one wants hearing 

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.280
 Listen, it was funny once. Understand it. 

00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:44.020
 Re full twitter to get Carter's chicken fingers 

00:10:44.020 --> 00:10:46.200
 this is funy. He was watching, he was strange 

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:52.775
 And the fact that this tweet has more tweets about Obama's chuckle 

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:54.700
 There is something beautiful about it. 

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:58.855
 But these powerful children - do your job next time, what about it? 

00:10:58.855 --> 00:11:01.565
 And stop wasting my time. I do not want to see these things 

00:11:01.565 --> 00:11:03.280
 I do not want to hear about it - 

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.840
 Just stop 

00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:07.620

00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.980
 Right 

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:16.980
 All I need is 5,000 very few 500 thousand lychees and I will never return 

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.760
 I'll be waiting 

00:11:19.340 --> 00:11:23.180
 Just let me know when we reach 500 thousand okay? 

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:26.220
 Just promise you'll let me know so I know when it comes out 

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:27.320
