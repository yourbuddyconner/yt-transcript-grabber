 LWIAY 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.840
 * If there is a chaotic timeline of subtitles, it may be caused by pewds deleting the movie in the background. The translator can't do anything, please forgive me * 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.300
 LWIAY 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.520
 LWIAY 

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.160
 Now I look forward to seeing these videos every week. 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.640
 Because too many things happened 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.340
 If you want to summarize this week, the best way is 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.020
 Meme 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.280
 How else did you get these news? 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.060
 And pewdiepie's reddit 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.660
 Let's get started, everyone. 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:33.580
 Wait a minute, are you serious? 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.720
 More than 51,000 "tops"? (Note: reddit function, similar to ptt's "push") 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.220
 This is the most "top" ever. 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.640
 God, ah... 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.900
 My favorite part is that they dance the fornite dance in the suicide forest. 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.900
 But those who replaced the bodies were those dying channels. 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.880
 True genius 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.980
 Really? This year is really beyond the standard. 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.020
 Thank you, Dad. 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.860
 You finally support my channel. 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.460
 Kidding 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.160
 75,000 million subscriptions! 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.080
 My God, I can't... 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.740
 Everybody, it’s 76 million, ok? 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.180
 Will it be arithmetic? 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.280
 you idiot 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.480
 Marques 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.560
 Marques! 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.200
 And Mark "Ass" Brownlee 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.340
 Damn! Now I can claim that I have appeared in the second 'Do not like' movie in Youtube. 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:17.900
 You are not worth it, Marques... 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.780
 We talked about how different this review will be. 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.440
 From more than 300 talents to about one hundred remaining 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:23.900
 But the movie clip is still great 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.460
 It always looks like trying to please, including everyone 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.280
 But this is obviously not done 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.020
 Ok, these are what I know now. 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.200
 Subscribe to pewdiepie 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.280
 Subscribe to pewdiepie! 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:35.880
 Oh, yes, I also share this on Twitter. 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.600
 Because there are many people pointing this out, but... 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.180
 Jaiden also hid more stalks 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.980
 Subscribe to pewdiepie (Note: Submarine submarine → subs) 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.780
 I think this is a smash letter. (Note: It should be the stalk of the Nintendo star.) 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.920
 That obviously means Logan Paul's tie game. 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.680
 Oh, this has 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.580
 Is that "scorpion lasagna"? No?! 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.640
 Uganda Knuckles 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.760
 This is great 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.060
 An Indian 9-year-old child spent a few months making this game for pewds. 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.020
 But it has never been to LWIAY 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.960
 Although it has been PO three times, there are more than 25,000 praises. 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.620
 Also won the gold medal 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.580
 Sorry, but what?! 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.700
 I haven't seen this, are you kidding? 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.060
 Hey! It’s Marzia. 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.620
 Where is the lasagna placed? 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.860
 I think I put it somewhere here. 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.200
 What's that? 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.320
 No! Marzia don't! Please! 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.860
 Felix! Fe... 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.340
 I mean, finally there is a game with a good plot. 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.680
 God killed, where is my lasagna, Marzia? 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.560
 Where is Marzia going? 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.960
 Bean knowledge! 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.700
 In Italy they call the lasagna "pasticcio" 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.060
 I like this music 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.260
 Hey! Felix 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.820
 Who is this? Hey! Brad... 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.960
 Hey! Felix... "My voice is not like that" 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.920
 - Hey, Brad! - You won't believe it, Felix... 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.640
 I saw a shadow man kidnapped Marzia for unknown reasons. 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.860
 I was injured when I tried to save her. 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.800
 Of course you will save... "I am a true hero here" 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:57.500
 Hey, man, how do you feel? 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.700
 Fast forward to the house... 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.460
 No, I am fine, you go to the town for help to save Mazia. 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.460
 Ok, take care, Brad 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.100
 You are always so kind and hearty 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.680
 Every time I feel that I should confirm that there is nothing on the left side. 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.140
 The picture is beautiful 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.300
 Look at this animation, there is everything I like about me... 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:16.620
 Hey! I am collecting... 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.180
 Hey, the game is broken... 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:22.040
 Ok, use these guns to let them know who is the boss. 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.560
 Oh, I thought they were boots. 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.880
 Pew gun! 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:26.020
 Awesome 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:28.300
 I put it in the O column. 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.400
 I am collecting the profit of Youtube! 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.240
 Ah!! It is to cancel the profit!! 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.840
 Kill it! 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:38.680
 Kill it!! 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:39.740
 This is really great 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.240
 This is awkward 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.100
 I don't know how to open this. 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.760
 Is this going to solve the puzzle? 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.160
 I won't solve it, please... 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.680
 Can this be pushed? Hey, can... 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:57.700
 That's right, take a look at this operation 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:03:58.640
 What is Edgar doing? 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.160
 Edgar, what are you doing?? 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.820
 What's that??!! 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.660
 Ok, I got something, I probably use it... 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:07.300
 Ok, this is awesome... 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.140
 God killed, I really play games ~ 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.380
 Bye~Edgar 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:13.560
 It is Youtube!! 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.000
 Go to you, Youtube, I am sorry... 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.600
 No! No! No! 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.200
 It took my video for profit... 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:27.620
 This is the most realistic game ever! 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.260
 Does this have to become a game-playing movie? 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.240
 I completely forget that I originally wanted to do LWIAY. 

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.000
 Oh, God. 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.440
 Edgar, go get that... 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.020
 ...thing 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:38.080
 Thanks 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:40.760
 I mean, I don't want to... 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.860
 This is just a demo version, but... 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.600
 The best game of the year? 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.540
 You do not want... 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:47.000
 Celestial, Youtube 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.560
 I am fed up with your dog, your mother killed it, Youtube 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.720
 Don't let me off again. 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:53.400
 Hyun Fu Gun (Note: It may also be the stem of the flex tape) 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.080
 Show off the rich time! 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.080
 Edgar is as useless as Tars in the Sonic Kid. 

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.980
 E!!! 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:04:59.940
 E!!! 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.960
 God damn it, I don’t like it. 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:05.520
 Don't do this to me, Markiplier 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:08.640
 Oh, I am going to die, I may really die. 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:10.180
 Don't E me again. 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:12.340
 My God, I am really dead. 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.900
 I am the developer of this game Gurpreet Singh Matharoo 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.140
 I think I want to show up to thank you for playing this game. 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.160
 This means a lot to me. I hope I can make this project even further. 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.260
 Make a real game 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.740
 But sadly, I need to concentrate on my work and higher priorities. 

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.075
 it's OK 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.080
 Anyway, I hope you like this preview game. 

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.700
 If you can let me know your experience, I will be very happy. 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:41.680
 Leave a message under the game page 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:43.080
 Oh, and... 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.640
 Don't worry about the chair here, I won't ask you 399 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.740
 Take it, then fall under the pit 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:55.480
 You will be sent back to where the game started so you can play with the chair 

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.040
 what? 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.120
 what? 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.240
 awesome 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.020
 How do I enable it? 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:07.760
 chair! 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:12.400
 YES! 

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.520
 This changed everything... Hey! I can still turn! 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:17.620
 I can turn, slaying 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:20.880
 Flash off, Brad! 

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.540
 399! 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:24.680
 10/10 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.780
 10/10 

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.560
 Now we have to go back to meme 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.400
 No, I didn't watch the game because of the card, ok? 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.140
 God, thank you very much, that’s great. 

00:06:33.420 --> 00:06:34.860
 Pewdiepie's sideline 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:37.380
 Don't pass it on to those photos that look like me! 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:40.480
 I know that I look like a casual Swede on earth. 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.540
 But that is racism 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.040
 It’s funny if youtube review is cancelled. 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.900
 They really took 12 hours to shoot a 2 second clip. 

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:50.280
 I mean, how much do you want them to spend... 

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.520
 They must have spent a lot of money on reviewing the film. 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:55.880
 Wait, I want to show you this, you may have seen it. 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:00.760
 Little Justin’s Baby MV has almost 300,000 'dislikes' per day. 

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.800
 Because people want 2018 reviews to become the most unpopular film 

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.140
 This is the perfect example, showing... 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.980
 Turning "hate" into another is the fastest way to eliminate hatred 

00:07:10.980 --> 00:07:11.840
 Everyone... 

00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:15.520
 Sometimes we need to make a major sacrifice here. 

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.760
 We have to go to Xiao Jia’s Baby MV. 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.400
 I am curious if I have pressed 'don't like' 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:23.920
 Then we have to remove... I have pressed 'dislike'!! 

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.440
 It's time to remove our 'dislike' 

00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:28.960
 Let's go ahead, just like the beginning 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.100
 Youtuber pewdiepie calls her "love cry" after Lilly Singh’s opinion on wage inequality 

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:34.920
 How about changing to this title? 

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:40.020
 Youtuber pewdiepie naturally took Lilly Singh out of the whip because she was a "crying ghost" 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.160
 How is the title changed to this? 

00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:44.600
 In Melbourne, Australia 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.700
 Out of our strength 

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:48.760
 ♪Hit or miss, I guess they never miss, huh?♪ 

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:52.880
 She recently reached a five million subscription and can we reach her six million? 

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.360
 Because she sneaked pewdiepie's chair into Youtube Review 

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.660
 We can grow this channel 

00:07:58.660 --> 00:07:59.900
 Use 5...5...? 

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:01.500
 Just for meme, everyone 

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:02.340
 I mean, why not? 

00:08:02.340 --> 00:08:04.340
 In fact, that is what happened to my channel. 

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.600
 We have a strength in Hungary

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:10.720
 Damn... 

00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:12.660
 Damn! 

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.260
 1% of the world is subscribed to pewdiepie 

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.040
 I mean, obviously this is not true. 

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:18.960
 Because there are a lot of duplicate accounts 

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:20.340
 There are still many dead people 

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:20.940
 and also... 

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.160
 Can you not rewind? 

00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:24.920
 A celebrity appeared in the review... 

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.660
 A twitch live master appeared in the review... 

00:08:26.660 --> 00:08:30.660
 A Youtuber who has not uploaded a film for 7...9 months 

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.280
 Let us treat her as the facade of the review! 

00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:37.120
 A film has been made for almost 10 years, becoming the most book... 

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.260
 "Daily", can I add it? "Daily"! 

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:45.100
 Youtuber, who became the most subscribed, has donated money to a 9-year-old child in India for five years but has not appeared in the review. 

00:08:45.340 --> 00:08:46.660
 Really sad 

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:49.260
 When I am..., where are you? ♪ 

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:50.920
 Now...呃...♪ 

00:08:51.180 --> 00:08:54.200
 What happened in your office? 

00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:57.740
 I will add something 

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.000
 I am still thinking 

00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.000
 Don't worry, ok? 

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.920
 Don't complain! 

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.360
 Underrated message 

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.400
 It is called "Youtube Rewind" because its quality is declining every year. 

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:16.200
 When the reporter wrote an article about pewds, it looks like: 

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:18.660
 "Reality can be done by me" 

00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.300
 I mean... 

00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:23.060
 This is 100% accurate meme, everyone 

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:30.640
 I have experienced some difficulties, so I want to draw something that can make Felix laugh (hopefully, laugh) 

00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.920
 You are successful, you really make me laugh, that's awesome, thank you very much. 

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.860
 I won't say "words beginning with N" so I don't know... 

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:38.000
 Dear pewdiepie... 

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.060
 Your dark moments will be uncovered by unpopular allies 

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:43.400
 Logang is coming soon 

00:09:43.400 --> 00:09:46.380
 Not the hero we want but the hero we need 

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:48.660
 I like it a bit... 

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.660
 You know, although people are different 

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:52.780
 People can still get together 

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:55.060
 To fight against T-series 

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:57.980
 Youtube really doesn't care about our army 

00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:00.880
 Why didn't I appear in this year's review? 

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.760
 Dane... 

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:03.780
 You are too much now, Youtube 

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.820
 Did Dane appear in the Youtube review? 

00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:07.040
 It’s really disgusting! 

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:08.860
 Dane is a hero 

00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:11.560
 Now to clarify, I don’t know if Dane is a Nazi. 

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.115
 I have not confirmed the authenticity. 

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:14.900
 Haven't done background research yet 

00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.360
 Just don't want to get into trouble 

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.320
 All grown up 

00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:18.760
 Pewdipeie, 9 years old 

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:20.280
 Pewdipeie, 14 years old 

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.160
 Anan, my 14-year-old children 

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:28.620
 'Jaiden Animation' successfully sneaked pewds into the review to prove that Youtube has no quality review or review their videos. 

00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.580
 I can't believe that Youtube is quite pewdiepie. 

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.600
 Pewdiepie is a Nazi, then... (Activate "Journalist's Logic.exe") 

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:35.560
 (Activate "Reporter's Logic.exe") 

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:38.240
 The youtube review puts the pewdiepie chair in (activates the reporter's logic.exe) 

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.940
 That means... (Activate "Journalist's Logic.exe") 

00:10:39.940 --> 00:10:41.600
 Youtube is Nazi! (Activate "Journalist's Logic.exe") 

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.780
 Really disappointing 

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:45.380
 Who else thinks Jaiden deserves a chair... 

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.860
 Tekashi69 guest "meme review" 

00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:54.800
 Jaiden guest star "meme review" 

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:59.120
 It seems that my reddit has found a new girl to be fascinated. 

00:10:59.540 --> 00:11:01.680
 Sorry, skyLOL, I guess... 

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:03.280
 I think they forgot to swear, right? 

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:07.320
 "A film for youtube review" "Jaiden Animation" 

00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:09.900
 "The stem of the pewdiepie" Everybody! 

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:10.960
 You can't stop 

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:13.400
 Can I report the Youtube review by copyright? 

00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.660
 Yes! You can! 

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:17.520
 We must make it come true, everyone 

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.880
 Pewdiepie did not appear in Youtube Review 2018 

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:25.180
 'Jaiden animation' penetration 'pewdiepie chair' into the film 

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:27.160
 Pewdiepie... That's right! That's right! 

00:11:27.160 --> 00:11:30.140
 Use the "including his surroundings" for copyright reporting on Youtube 

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:31.900
 Take all the profits! 

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:34.580
 Can I report Youtube by copyright? 

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.520
 Mr.Beast 

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.940
 Mark... 

00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:56.240
 Ok... 

00:11:56.540 --> 00:11:57.900
 Animal cruelty 

00:11:57.900 --> 00:11:59.020
 Let's continue 

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:02.320
 My God, it’s so much better, Will Smith’s meme, please. 

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:04.600
 That will definitely be "meme review" 

00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:05.760
 awesome! 

00:12:09.140 --> 00:12:09.940
 Really a good meme! 

00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:12.420
 The media when pewds donated money to charity 

00:12:12.540 --> 00:12:15.100
 Pewds may be in dispute when the media 

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.720
 Although a little doubtful about the benefits of doing so, but... 

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.500
 I mean, it’s obvious that they don’t need to do the good things we do. 

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:23.040
 I think this is a good story. 

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:25.420
 Turn "hate" into something positive 

00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:27.940
 Do some good things at the same time but now it looks... 

00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.980
 They insist that I come to be a villain 

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.580
 So they can continue to use these fishing titles 

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:35.340
 In a way that is not good for me 

00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.020
 This will never change 

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:38.900
 I think this is a good example. 

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:41.180
 Because these good things are completely ignored 

00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:45.140
 Also, now I’m smearing my anti-Semitic 

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:48.080
 Because I recommend a video and channel that I like. 

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.760
 I mean, this is just... let's keep watching 

00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:52.580
 Maybe it’s time for us to fight back against this empire. 

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:56.060
 When pewdiepie gets a new subscriber every time, it always creates a world record. 

00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.060
 Actually, that is true 

00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:59.980
 Thank you, adventure penguin 

00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:01.740
 A goose? Is he called a goose? I don't remember. 

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:06.800
 Petition pewdiepie to host a special "year meme review" 

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:08.440
 As his last film of the year 

00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.960
 I actually have to do this. 

00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:12.440
 I think, come a little...hey... 

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.160
 This year's nostalgic meme 

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.140
 Will be great 

00:13:16.140 --> 00:13:18.800
 Hey, Felix, we just want to ask Marzia how it is? 

00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:22.760
 We hope that you have been doing well. 

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:23.560
 Nine-year-old children 

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.140
 She is very good, thank you for asking 

00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:29.020
 She... she founded her own brand Mai, she is busy with those 

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.740
 Then...this took up all her time 

00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:35.760
 Petition to remove the legs from the new reddit logo 

00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:37.680
 This meme has become too much 

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.260
 This "I have no feet" stalk 

00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:41.580
 It’s no longer interesting 

00:13:41.860 --> 00:13:42.900
 I have feet 

00:13:43.020 --> 00:13:46.180
 Just like what you saw... I obviously have feet 

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.060
 Pewdi wan 

00:13:48.140 --> 00:13:49.920
 You let them come against me 

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.820
 You are self-sufficient 

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:56.620
 Pewdiepie recommended a hateful, anti-Jewish channel 

00:13:56.780 --> 00:13:59.560
 Pelo: Sorry, that's Gloria Borger. 

00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.900
 Also known as: Oopsie Doopsie 

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:03.920
 Have an interesting affiliate small meme 

00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:05.380
 The person who wrote this article 

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:07.840
 Very ironic to push some text, like... 

00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:12.360
 I don't have to add my own opinion... but this is my opinion on this. 

00:14:12.720 --> 00:14:17.320
 Media: Other photos of hundreds of pewdiepies found on the internet in the article 

00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:18.940
 Media: .... 

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.100
 That's right... 

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:27.440
 Every one... every slaying article must use my photo of this genius 

00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.420
 I mean, I think it might be worse but... 

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.360
 Awesome! (Note: Subtitles are blocked and become "thot") 

00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:36.640
 I have appeared in this year's review but only blurred in the background 

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:37.740
 What does it look like? 

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:41.960
 They promised that I would be a special character flying for 15 hours, after sacrificing 'missing the cube' (?) 

00:14:41.960 --> 00:14:45.160
 I, Nick, and a bunch of creators took 8 to 10 hours. 

00:14:45.300 --> 00:14:47.680
 Look, it’s usually this feeling. 

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:50.600
 They... they could have finished shooting quickly and easily 

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:52.260
 However, since youtube has become rich, 

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:54.520
 They said: Hey! Let's spend all day. 

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.940
 But the result came out, only 2 seconds 

00:14:59.260 --> 00:15:00.320
 "metamorphic paradise" 

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:03.840
 Go to pewdiepie, or I will delete the site. 

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:08.800
 All players pay attention! To defeat T-series once and for all 

00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:10.460
 Pewdiepie needs your help! 

00:15:10.640 --> 00:15:13.780
 Pressing the subscribe button is like my day... same 

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:15.620
 The murder is great. 

00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:17.620
 I can't thank you any more. 

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:19.180
 All of these support 

00:15:19.240 --> 00:15:21.900
 Honestly, this is very important to me, really interesting. 

00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:24.440
 Anyway, I hope you like this movie, if you like, press like 

00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.640
 You know what else you have to do now I don't need to remind you again, right? 

00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:30.160
 But, see you next time~ 

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:34.860
 Translation, timeline: JT 

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:39.620
 * If there is a chaotic timeline of subtitles, it may be that pewds cut the video in the background, the translator can't do anything, please forgive me *
