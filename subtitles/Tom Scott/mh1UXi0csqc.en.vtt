00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.350
Today's video contains images of a preserved
dead body.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.430
If that's not for you: time to pick another
video.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.040
This is a dead man. Or most of a dead man.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.460
This is the skeleton of philosopher Jeremy
Bentham, who died in 1832,

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.939
preserved, stuffed, dressed in his own clothes,

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.869
all as requested in his will,

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.050
and put on display at University College London.

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.720
And it is a little bit creepy.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.089
NICK BOOTH: He's bolted to his chair, and
he's wearing a conservation-grade nodysuit

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:35.809
held together with copper wire and hinged
in his joints, so in theory he could move

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:39.289
in a realistic manner. We don't do that any
more, because he's very delicate.

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:44.800
There's a few theories as to why. He didn't
like the church, he was an atheist, and at

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.719
the time you had to pay money to be buried,
as you still do now, and one of the theories

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.359
is that he just didn't want to give money
to the church. Also, he did have a bit of

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.379
a sense of humour. He maybe wanted to get
some more use out of his body rather than

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.989
just be buried in the ground.

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:04.019
TIM CAUSER: Jeremy Bentham is most famous
for being the founder of modern utilitarianism.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:09.549
That is, the idea that all action and legislation
should be for the promotion of the greatest

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:15.840
happiness. The famous quotation is "the greatest
happiness for the greatest number".

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:22.280
Bentham tried to write about 12 pages a day.
He tried to keep in that rhythm. And occasionally,

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.579
when we're looking through his papers, we'll
come across a sheet dated 25th December and

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:29.799
think, you know, Jeremy, just have a break(!)

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:34.060
Transcribe Bentham is a crowdsourced transcription
initiative. The transcripts of the manuscripts

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.549
that they're producing, we'll use as a starting
point for producing volumes of Bentham's collected

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.360
works, which is the main purpose of the Bentham
Project here at UCL.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.340
One of the major things in his life was an
attempt to reform the law. He studied law,

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.920
he began to practice law -- his first case,
he realised his client would actually pay

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.810
him more than he would get in compensation,
for Bentham representing him. So Bentham,

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:02.399
at this point, threw up the law and decided
that he would instead dedicate the rest of

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:03.710
his life to reforming it.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.360
TOM SCOTT: The actual head that came up with
most of those thoughts, though? That's not

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.420
it. That is a wax model.

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.690
The actual head didn't get preserved really
all that well, so it's kept in a sealed box

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.599
somewhere else.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.200
It was kept in a sealed box just here, but
then some students from a rival university

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.129
stole it and held it for ransom.

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.319
NICK BOOTH: It was stored in his chest cavity
for a while, and then it was discovered there

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.430
in 1898, during the first proper inspection
of him.

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.069
Then it was taken out and for a while it was
kept in a box, we think, just on the ledge

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.510
on the doorway to my left, and now it's in
one of the safes here at UCL.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.980
TIM CAUSER: The thing that Bentham is most
famous for is the Panopticon prison scheme.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.080
The basic design of the Panopticon prison
was that it was meant to be a circular prison,

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.580
with the cells arranged around the outside
and a central inspection tower in the middle

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.800
of the prison. And from there, the prison
inspector, through an elaborate network of

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.310
curtains and lights, would be able to look
into any of the cells at any point and see

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.400
the prisoners without himself being seen.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.700
So he expected that prisoners would, in trying
to avoid any punishment that would come by

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.980
violating the Panopticon's rules and regulations,
the prisoners would modify their behaviour

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:19.140
and eventually be released as working, decent
members of the public again.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.170
It became increasingly clear that the British
government, rather than building a penitentiary,

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.580
would rather pack off prisoners to Australia,
as it was a lot cheaper.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.879
TOM SCOTT: And if you think it'd be a brilliant
prank to write in your will that your should

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:35.830
be preserved, stuffed, and donated to someone
you loved, or hated: don't get too excited.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.680
Your rights end when you die. So the final
say on what happens to your corpse goes to

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.159
your family and friends. And while it is perfect
legal, in the UK, to preserve and display

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.650
a body -- if you want that to happen, you'll
need to find someone as strange as the man

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.190
who preserved Jeremy Bentham.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.960
