00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.520
 There is an old-fashioned story that if you're 999 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.320
 the British equivalent of 911 or 10111 - 

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.460
 there is an old-fashioned story to call that number 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.910
 your phone will charge battery. 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.480
 And if you look on the Internet, you'll see some police forces in the UK 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.240
 sent out press releases saying it was not true. 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.260
 Don't do it, it stops the emergency lines. 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.890
 And there are articles and comment boards that attack people who believe this. 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.570
 How can they be so stupid? 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.070
 What idiot would believe such a thing? 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.029
 But the only thing is that it is almost true. 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.239
 Do you remember Blackberries? They were those phones that business people had 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.309
 before real smartphones came out. 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.510
 Their UK headquarters are behind me, here in Slough. 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.960
 Slough. 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.639
 To Blackberry had another market reach above 1% 

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:48.539
 it was not just businessmen who used their phones; Teenagers also have. 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.999
 BBM - BlackBerry Messenger - was the WhatsApp of its time. 

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:54.559
 Kits, Free, Unlimited Short Messages, 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.670
 as long as everyone you knew had a BlackBerry phone - 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.399
 and as long as that phone had battery power. 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.510
 When certain types of BlackBerry phones' battery was almost flat 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.710
 they went into limited "emergency calls only" fashion 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.810
 No BBM. Nothing. 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.439
 You'd get nothing useful from it. 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.549
 It just said "use battery for radio for radio" 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.170
 This would allow you to call emergency services, 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.859
 just in case, but nothing else. 

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:18.390
 It was a pretty sensible idea from the BlackBerry engineers. 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.270
 But they did it in an unfinished way 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.880
 and they didn't think about what people actually want to do with their phones. 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.229
 Because there are emergencies that do not involve the 999 call. 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.659
 Like being lost, alone or desperate 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.359
 and just want to reach one person. 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:34.659
 Ma. I am sorry. 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.340
 I made a big mistake. 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.450
 I went to Slough. 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.899
 It turned out that, on a Blackberry, 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:44.149
 if you made an emergency call and then immediately put it down, 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.499
 that the radios stayed. The phone was no longer blocked. 

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:51.329
 With all its connections working. It took quite a few minutes 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.710
 while using the burdens a bit of power. 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.109
 Unless you shut it down or shut down the screen. 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:57.350
 Then, depending on the model, 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.679
 You might have to call 999 to unblock it. 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:02.479
 You can see where the myth came from. 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.770
 And it has mobile phone companies in the UK 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.420
 cost about a pound every time someone 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.299
 999 phoned by them, even if it was just for a moment 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.239
 so they weren't too happy with this either. 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.110
 Now, I'm not saying that there is no sloppy program code, for quick-developed ideas, 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.799
 is not in the world. 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.890
 Heaven knows, I've made enough of myself, 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.170
 But, take a short cut on a phone that millions of people use - 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.190
 have used millions of people, 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.260
 And suddenly you have enough false calls coming in 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.180
 to block actual emergencies. 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.220
 Small choices that ultimately make a big difference. 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.970
 I'm going out of Slough now.
