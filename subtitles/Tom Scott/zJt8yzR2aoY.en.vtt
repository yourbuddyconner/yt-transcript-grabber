00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.680
 Hey, you will transfer instantly, congratulations. Welcome to this club, now you are a superhero. But superhero 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:13.459
 Very boring. They will only save people like this, you can do even more powerful things. Next 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:19.290
 Just talk about how to manipulate the world. 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:22.990
 First look at what will hinder you. If you are lucky, your mobility will be relative to the Earth. 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.550
 The position moves because the earth moves around the sun at 30 kilometers per second, 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.180
 At the same time, it is moving at a speed of ten times faster on the background of the cosmic microwave. This background is also the most reasonable. 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.350
 Location reference coordinates. 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:37.550
 If you are not moving relative to the earth, then you probably haven't learned to transfer instantly. 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.019
 Because you are learning how to disappear in the vast universe. 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:43.230
 &lt;&lt; I... I am here 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.329
 That's it. Your second obstacle is: different positions on the earth's surface at different speeds 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.499
 mobile. I know this seems counterintuitive, but it has always been like a disc, on the polar 

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:58.749
 The location did not move all day, but at the equator 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:03.369
 It will move a lot more. That is, if you move to another block - 

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:10.320
 - Then you will be safe and sound. But what about going from New York to Washington? You will hit the wall at 20 miles per hour. From 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.500
 Polar to the equator? You will reach the wall at 1000 mph and make it a blood red. I want to say, actually 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.380
 To offset it, you don't need to consume a lot of energy, just 7000 joules, you have a cola. 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.840
 But - still pay attention. 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.910
 Also, don't go up and down when you go to Australia. 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.700
 Steven Gould's Mobile World/Over the Airwalker series writes about the physical phenomenon of this transfer 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.340
 And if someone can control the momentum, how to write well. 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.670
 But comic heroes? They don't have to worry about this, they can move directly to 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.420
 In space, even if it actually flashes outside the gravity well 

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.310
 The energy used in such a distant place has not been used so much for a whole week. And they 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.920
 Just jump back, even if those waste heat should be enough 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:55.640
 Cook them, they don't have to care about them. 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.280
 They are anti-thermal kinetics, if you can do it, then 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.980
 You can manipulate the world. 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:07.450
 If you are an evil person, don't want to rob the bank or kidnap the president. Find something 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.090
 Big and heavy things - 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.280
 - flash to the highlands - 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:17.800
 - Hold it at a speed of a few hundred miles, then let go. 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:18.190
 Flash again. 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.530
 [Explosive in the distance] They... They are fine. 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.010
 You have just created an artificial asteroid impact. Or, use some extra large 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.480
 Ultra-high-density things, basically like nuclear bomb explosions, just gone 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.470
 Those radiation and dust. 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.060
 Hey, you can threaten others to move to the asteroid belt, you can control the momentum, then 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.530
 Drop the stone to the earth. This should be enough for you to earn billions. 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.440
 Or are you a good person? Ah, I have a better idea. 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.250
 Find something big, heavy and magnetic &gt;&gt; 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.350
 - Just like this, but bigger. Go to the height and drop it to an oversized 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:55.110
 In the middle of the coil, you can make free electricity. Otherwise it can be a little better if you can 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.490
 Manufacturing portals in mid-air - 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:01.650
 Just like this - you can do something better. 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:09.260
 Take back your big, heavy, magnetic stuff and make an infinite loop... 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.080
 That's it, wrapping it around with a coil, no limit to energy. This should be saved 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:15.650
 The lives of millions of people. 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:20.740
 Can be a little more powerful, jump to the orbit of the planet, let the cost of putting things in space 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.930
 Become your time. Or go to Mars and bring some pioneers and equipment. You can 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.950
 Colonization began in the solar system. 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:35.840
 Or: You can do what other heroes do, in a city in a country on a planet 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.739
 Fight crime. Superheroes really didn't think about it. 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.280
