00:00:01.701 --> 00:00:03.603
 Finally ah!!!!!!!!! 

00:00:03.603 --> 00:00:07.474
 I want to play video games, everyone is great!!! 

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:12.479
 "Detroit: Changing People" I will never remember the most stupid game name in history. 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.482
 Like "Super Killer: Two Souls" 

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:20.320
 What are you doing? "Detroit: Changing People" Please ask for a normal name. 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.457
 I just spent five minutes thinking about "What is the name of the game?" 

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:26.726
 Haotian 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:28.828
 Uh 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.532
 It looks so uncomfortable at first sight. 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.310
 God, she is breaking the fourth wall, ah, ah. 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:45.945
 Hehehe 

00:00:46.713 --> 00:00:48.381
 Oh, this is so great. 

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:51.818
 I want to choose moderate, I am moderate. 

00:00:51.818 --> 00:00:57.570
 God, it’s strange to see such a picture is weird. 

00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:01.270
 I don’t know what you know, hahaha. 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.199
 Ok, it’s very good, I’m sure I’m good enough. 

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:08.568
 Ok? Please don't hesitate. 

00:01:09.202 --> 00:01:11.371
 What do you want to set up? 

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:15.875
呃 I want a very good game experience with a very good control system. 

00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:20.113
呃If you choose casual, then don’t play anymore. 

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:22.150
 let's start 

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:27.821
 Hey, you can't tell me. 

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.357
 thank you 

00:01:37.263 --> 00:01:39.320
 Of course, brother 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.501
 Having said that, I am very much looking forward to playing this game. 

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:43.970
 I love "Rainstorm" is one of my favorite games. 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.472
 "Super killer: two souls" You know 

00:01:45.472 --> 00:01:47.874
 Very entertaining but not excellent 

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:50.343
 So I will hesitate when this game is launched. 

00:01:50.343 --> 00:01:53.279
 I didn't want to play right away until I judged it. 

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.382
 Then I found myself not rushing to the starting lineup. 

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:57.751
 Everyone has already played, so I think I should not play. 

00:01:57.751 --> 00:01:59.719
 But I found out that this game is really cool. 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:03.156
 I want to play, I really want to play. 

00:02:03.156 --> 00:02:07.927
 So let's start, I hope you can join me on this journey. 

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:11.598
 As long as it’s a good game, shooting is always fun. 

00:02:11.598 --> 00:02:13.933
 As far as I know this game is a good game. 

00:02:13.933 --> 00:02:16.200
 Then I have to start walking everyone. 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.842
 Hehe, you can hear the sound of the background. 

00:02:22.842 --> 00:02:24.811
 Hey let me take a look 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.315
 Explain to people who don’t know much 

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:32.850
 This kind of game is based on the story story. 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.290
 Allows you to change the plot from the options 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.959
 "Rainstorms" is the inspiration for this game. 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.728
 I don't care about your daughter! 

00:02:41.728 --> 00:02:44.300
 Let me finish my words 

00:02:53.807 --> 00:02:56.276
 Oh, I am a real person, thank you. 

00:02:57.544 --> 00:02:59.546
 Good Allen captain 

00:03:01.815 --> 00:03:04.651
 See your mission, what are our tasks? 

00:03:04.651 --> 00:03:06.720
 Find the captain, it looks like he 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:12.559
 What happened? 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.630
 Hello~ I am a robotic armpit armpit 

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:21.101
 Hello there? 

00:03:29.542 --> 00:03:31.411
 Hahahaha 

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.956
 Uh 

00:03:42.956 --> 00:03:45.725
 I don't know what the name should be? 

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.370
 What is its recent status? 

00:03:58.705 --> 00:04:01.174
 I have not entered the situation, it is a little difficult to choose. 

00:04:04.477 --> 00:04:06.112
 So there is human nature 

00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:10.617
 Hey... I know what the situation is. 

00:04:10.617 --> 00:04:14.988
 The probability of success is the decisive key to every second? 

00:04:14.988 --> 00:04:17.824
 Know the state of things is good 

00:04:17.824 --> 00:04:21.161
 I will save the hostages without paying the price. 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.300
 Understand the state of things 

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.672
 Sorry, what is my mission? 

00:04:34.808 --> 00:04:37.777
 Oh, all? I thought I could choose 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.582
 very funny 

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:47.454
 Good analysis, he is working hard 

00:04:47.454 --> 00:04:49.589
 what happened to you? 

00:04:49.589 --> 00:04:52.392
 The first victim of the police 

00:04:52.392 --> 00:04:55.280
 OK, we are looking for clues, OK, cool. 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.897
 What are you doing? Collecting information 

00:04:57.897 --> 00:05:00.734
 PO Dechart Antony 

00:05:00.734 --> 00:05:05.705
 Yeah, no one cares about being called Antony. It’s a loser. 

00:05:05.705 --> 00:05:10.610
 Stephen Tart, I just got a shot in the sulphur sulphide 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.380
 Ok, there is another clue. 

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:17.684
 Seeing that I didn’t find it, I must be a detective. 

00:05:17.684 --> 00:05:22.220
 Good right ventricle OK OK 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:24.357
 Let's analyze the murder scene, everyone! 

00:05:24.357 --> 00:05:29.195
 Press L2 to play back OK so we can see what's going on is cool 

00:05:30.497 --> 00:05:36.436
 ~Crush my heart because you dear because you gave ~ 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.938
 ~ painful love ~ 

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:44.778
 The police hit the prisoner and played back to find new clues. 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.883
 Then...the hostage is also there. 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:53.420
 I gave a moral impact and understood OK. 

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:58.358
 Then there must be other clues here to see 

00:05:58.858 --> 00:06:02.228
 Where I am, I really say that I am a genius. 

00:06:02.228 --> 00:06:06.320
 You are watching the genius, playing live, you are welcome, we found it. 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.569
 I found the gun and I was under the table. 

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:14.474
 No one else can find a thank you... Super technology 

00:06:14.474 --> 00:06:18.578
 We can find weapons that we can't find. This weapon has been here for several years. 

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:21.981
 Without me, it is impossible to find it. 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.154
 I don’t think I will leave fingerprints because I am a robot. 

00:06:28.154 --> 00:06:31.658
 So I took it and started to act. 

00:06:33.126 --> 00:06:36.229
 Century magazine robots work less and less 

00:06:37.897 --> 00:06:39.566
 Ah, he's fine. 

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:45.772
 Conner, is he right? Hey, don’t care. 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:49.943
 Don’t worry if you’re almost out 

00:06:49.943 --> 00:06:51.911
 YouTube hasn't caught us yet. 

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:57.283
 What kind of blue blood? 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.900
 YES, I like this game too much. 

00:07:07.627 --> 00:07:14.467
 Ok, so the more information you get, the more successful your mission. 

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:20.907
 Brother you 

00:07:21.474 --> 00:07:23.209
 Ok, I found the hostage. 

00:07:25.478 --> 00:07:28.214
 Why is it strange that he looks like me long? 

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:36.656
 What's your name? 

00:07:36.656 --> 00:07:38.825
 I mean, my name is Conner... 

00:07:44.664 --> 00:07:48.501
 Hey, I skipped two things, so I can't. 

00:07:51.971 --> 00:07:56.420
 I played the wrong way. I want to replay it. 

00:07:56.443 --> 00:08:00.347
 Ok, since I started to replay, I just said that I just wanted to say 

00:08:00.347 --> 00:08:07.420
 That is... I love this kind of game, especially "Rainstorm" 

00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.556
 "Rainstorm" is one of my favorite games because 

00:08:09.556 --> 00:08:12.826
 You really think 

00:08:12.826 --> 00:08:15.462
 The story is affected by your options 

00:08:15.462 --> 00:08:17.664
 That game has a lot of different endings 

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:21.100
 If you messed up, for example, the task is to save your son. 

00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.203
 If you messed up, chances are you will 

00:08:24.137 --> 00:08:27.941
 It turned into a very painful ending, but if it succeeds, it will let the game continue. 

00:08:27.941 --> 00:08:29.743
 I don't know how to say it, I feel very good. 

00:08:29.743 --> 00:08:31.711
 Then "Super Killer: Two Souls" is launched. 

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:35.615
 But it is like walking on your own story 

00:08:35.615 --> 00:08:40.887
 It’s a bit offensive to the meaning of video games. In retrospect, almost all of them are 

00:08:40.887 --> 00:08:46.426
 But after playing this one, I found out that they (the game company) have reference to the past style. 

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:49.996
 I really like this game to make you feel 

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:52.565
 Ok, we are back. OK, we are back here. 

00:08:52.565 --> 00:08:57.771
 I just want to say that I really like this game and let you feel it. 

00:09:01.141 --> 00:09:03.576
 The impact of your choice is great 

00:09:04.144 --> 00:09:06.346
 But playing on YouTube is not easy because 

00:09:06.346 --> 00:09:08.480
 My goodness 

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:13.820
 Because if everyone knows that you have chosen the wrong or made a mistake, you will be super angry. 

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:18.725
 I tell you that I will try my best to make a choice. 

00:09:18.725 --> 00:09:22.280
 That is not a family who is going to have dinner. 

00:09:24.898 --> 00:09:28.401
 We still have two things to do to search for hostages. 

00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:32.238
 Also check the victim to do this first. 

00:09:32.238 --> 00:09:33.506
 Can I run? 

00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:41.848
 If I go out like I used to, I will probably fail. 

00:09:41.848 --> 00:09:44.884
 This story will be completely different. 

00:09:44.884 --> 00:09:49.489
 Or! They just play us again and the story is the same anyway. 

00:09:49.489 --> 00:09:53.193
 This is the problem with this game. A lot of games are 

00:09:54.194 --> 00:09:56.629
 Let you think you can make a choice 

00:09:57.997 --> 00:10:01.401
 I think this is why telltale's game has become obsolete. 

00:10:01.401 --> 00:10:04.270
 When you play for the first time, you will feel "women" 

00:10:05.605 --> 00:10:08.740
 I really think my options affect the changes in the plot. 

00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:10.610
 My choice is really important but I found out that it was not 

00:10:10.610 --> 00:10:12.178
 Everyone’s ending is the same 

00:10:13.313 --> 00:10:16.483
 Isn't it a PS VR? Wow lost the opportunity to put in marketing. 

00:10:16.483 --> 00:10:20.720
 Wait, this is the headset, the child didn’t hear the gunshots. 

00:10:22.889 --> 00:10:24.190
 Wait, is this a mystery? 

00:10:24.190 --> 00:10:29.529
 If you love your life, your life will live... 

00:10:29.529 --> 00:10:32.665
 What is this the most stupid thing I have ever heard? 

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:35.869
 What are you looking at? PewDiePie? YouTube? 

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:41.241
 I want to slide my board or Zoella, isn't it? 

00:10:44.344 --> 00:10:47.313
 Wow! Daniel! You don't look cool now! 

00:10:51.818 --> 00:10:56.523
 Oh, it’s very convenient to just play this video. Haha 

00:10:56.523 --> 00:10:59.250
 I don’t want to eat this set too. 

00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:01.895
可能性The possibility of our success has become higher 

00:11:01.895 --> 00:11:06.399
 Ok, who is the victim of the victim? 

00:11:06.399 --> 00:11:09.736
 Hey, how are you here? 

00:11:09.736 --> 00:11:13.206
 It doesn't look good, I don't know why I want to say hello. 

00:11:13.206 --> 00:11:15.709
 Blinking eyes, we check the eyes 

00:11:18.812 --> 00:11:21.114
 Audiences 

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:27.870
 Ok, the same method but different guys 

00:11:28.455 --> 00:11:32.580
呃好好喔恩哼哼气胸

00:11:32.580 --> 00:11:35.610
 Who is not that kind of thing, you are really a kind of 

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:36.963
 Too bad 

00:11:36.963 --> 00:11:40.533
 Ok, I know where he is going to die, where do I want to see? 

00:11:42.335 --> 00:11:46.439
 Where? It must be hair on the face. 

00:11:47.841 --> 00:11:50.643
 This is the chest, I know 

00:11:53.246 --> 00:11:58.785
 YES!!!! The best live on YouTube 

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:06.826
 What's the matter with him? He is sitting and resting, what is he holding? 

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:10.196
 Good fun and interesting, what else? 

00:12:12.165 --> 00:12:14.734
 My God replay 

00:12:15.335 --> 00:12:21.274
 There is a person who directly shot him... mother soup 

00:12:24.177 --> 00:12:28.381
 What do you mean? OK, we have finished the analysis. 

00:12:31.217 --> 00:12:33.386
 Hey, he got rid of what you mean 

00:12:33.386 --> 00:12:36.790
 Are you kidding me?! You can find it directly without analysis. 

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:40.927
 Oh yes, you can be very good. 

00:12:43.596 --> 00:12:46.299
 Hey, he has to be replaced! 

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:50.637
 You are a bastard! How can you change him! 

00:12:52.405 --> 00:12:55.775
 Ok, so we only have 76... 

00:12:55.775 --> 00:13:01.348
 70...%? Where is the flow chart? 

00:13:01.348 --> 00:13:06.860
 What? So what have we missed to find Captain Allen? 

00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.622
 what? What??? 

00:13:09.622 --> 00:13:13.293
 What????? What? No, this 

00:13:16.329 --> 00:13:22.702
 Ok, then only the hostages are found. 

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:29.175
 Ok, there is something, the gun is good, so we know us. 

00:13:32.512 --> 00:13:34.881
 We have found the gun 

00:13:41.421 --> 00:13:43.256
 What are the clues? 

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:47.600
 Ah bullet 

00:13:51.364 --> 00:13:53.433
 Ok, so there are indeed clues. 

00:13:59.773 --> 00:14:02.842
 The prisoner took his father’s gun 

00:14:06.513 --> 00:14:09.582
 So we know that he is armed now. 

00:14:09.582 --> 00:14:14.921
 I only have 78%!? Fucking!? It seems that there should be a chance. 

00:14:19.159 --> 00:14:23.296
 I have to calculate faster every second!!!! No!!!! 

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.536
 OK, I think we have finally done everything. 

00:14:30.904 --> 00:14:34.708
 Now we have not chosen ok. 

00:14:34.708 --> 00:14:37.911
 Hurry up 78%, there is a chance 

00:14:37.911 --> 00:14:40.980
 Why are you hitting me?! I have nothing to do! 

00:14:45.518 --> 00:14:47.387
 He won't hurt her 

00:14:56.863 --> 00:14:59.299
 Hey! Hey! 

00:15:01.434 --> 00:15:03.970
 Hehehehe 

00:15:03.970 --> 00:15:05.839
 Yeah! 

00:15:08.174 --> 00:15:09.309
 what 

00:15:09.309 --> 00:15:12.445
 Please, let's get worse! 

00:15:12.445 --> 00:15:14.314
 Ok, we found him. 

00:15:14.314 --> 00:15:18.551
 Slowly approaching a good Daniel calm 

00:15:25.158 --> 00:15:26.393
 fantastic 

00:15:33.330 --> 00:15:35.702
 Then let go of the girl, Daniel. 

00:15:36.836 --> 00:15:38.972
呃 lying 

00:15:42.375 --> 00:15:44.177
 what... 

00:15:44.177 --> 00:15:45.412
 hateful! 

00:15:51.685 --> 00:15:54.888
呃Emma and your relationship choose this 

00:16:02.328 --> 00:16:03.997
 Emma, ​​are you lying?? 

00:16:11.871 --> 00:16:15.750
 Ah, not Daniel, you are just making trouble. 

00:16:15.750 --> 00:16:17.243
 What are the possible factors? 

00:16:17.243 --> 00:16:19.312
 Oh, choose it. 

00:16:28.988 --> 00:16:30.657
 Is there something in the pool? 

00:16:38.698 --> 00:16:40.266
 Sympathize with him 

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:53.580
 Hey, we have done a good job! Good! 

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.858
 Right, you are crying again. 

00:17:14.634 --> 00:17:16.202
喔~ 

00:17:16.202 --> 00:17:17.871
 Accept 

00:17:21.775 --> 00:17:26.513
 Oh, no, no... Ahha! 

00:17:29.349 --> 00:17:31.518
 Now 喔那

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:34.421
 Come on, the last chance 

00:17:38.625 --> 00:17:40.560
 Ah hateful! 

00:17:41.227 --> 00:17:43.563
 Don't do this, I just want to speed up a little! 

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:47.000
 @#$&amp; Shut up! 

00:17:48.501 --> 00:17:49.769
 My goodness 

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.605
 No, no, brother. 

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.430
 Oh, okay, you know? 

00:17:59.145 --> 00:18:03.583
 Intimidating him, huh, how are you? 

00:18:05.251 --> 00:18:09.556
 Don't be so fast. 

00:18:17.297 --> 00:18:18.531
 nest 

00:18:19.299 --> 00:18:21.000
 what? What!? 

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.104
 What?! No! 

00:18:24.704 --> 00:18:26.306
 Do not!!!!!!! 

00:18:27.307 --> 00:18:29.843
 Are you kidding me? 

00:18:32.212 --> 00:18:34.314
 It's me 

00:18:35.215 --> 00:18:38.885
 You are an idiot for you. 

00:18:41.488 --> 00:18:43.890
 My goodness! 

00:18:56.836 --> 00:18:58.104
 hateful!!!!!!!!!!!! 

00:19:09.916 --> 00:19:13.553
 I am so angry 

00:19:23.396 --> 00:19:26.666
 Look at your look 

00:19:26.666 --> 00:19:32.272
 Ok, so there are a total of 1 2 3 4 5 

00:19:32.272 --> 00:19:36.900
 There are even six directions if I choose to use a gun. 

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:37.711
 I can shoot him. 

00:19:37.711 --> 00:19:40.380
 So cool, they will show it to you. 

00:19:42.248 --> 00:19:46.586
 Seeing that this is what I said, I really think that I am 

00:19:49.889 --> 00:19:56.496
 It seems that I have wasted too much time. My God is so cool. 

00:19:58.665 --> 00:20:01.334
 Can I go back to replay? This is the real problem. 

00:20:01.334 --> 00:20:03.300
 I don't think I can 

00:20:03.470 --> 00:20:05.572
 Ok, leave the gun! 

00:20:05.572 --> 00:20:09.676
 Sorry! I thought I could play very well. 

00:20:09.676 --> 00:20:11.244
 It seems that it is not possible 

00:20:13.513 --> 00:20:15.315
 come on!!!! 

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:23.189
 YAAAAAAAAAASSSSS! 

00:20:24.791 --> 00:20:26.659
 Trust me! 

00:20:29.696 --> 00:20:30.663
 Oh 

00:20:32.365 --> 00:20:36.603
 Don't kill, don't shoot at my face. 

00:20:37.404 --> 00:20:38.872
 YES!!! 

00:20:40.273 --> 00:20:43.430
 This is what you deserve! Daniel 

00:20:43.430 --> 00:20:45.545
 God, this is a picture of a real person. 

00:20:48.548 --> 00:20:53.119
 Ok, we have done it, finally, I spent some time. 

00:20:53.820 --> 00:20:55.422
 You Wang Ba 

00:20:58.425 --> 00:21:00.827
 I mean, oh.... 

00:21:00.827 --> 00:21:03.663
 How do you first technically shoot me first? 

00:21:03.663 --> 00:21:05.665
 So I don't know what else to say. 

00:21:07.133 --> 00:21:09.936
 Conner, come on a fast Dab, don't you? 

00:21:10.870 --> 00:21:13.707
 Mission success 

00:21:16.810 --> 00:21:20.714
 Pretty cool looks very visible at the moment 

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:28.755
 What do you think? Click on it to help me press it. 

00:21:30.523 --> 00:21:31.958
 and many more 

00:21:32.926 --> 00:21:34.894
 What are you waiting for? 

00:21:34.894 --> 00:21:37.664
 Didn't I have the archives that I just played? 

00:21:39.366 --> 00:21:41.668
 No, no, no, no, no, no 

00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:44.637
 Are you kidding? I can't do it, I don't accept it. 

00:21:47.273 --> 00:21:48.141
 Ok, I want to come back. 

00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:51.945
 Ok, we are back, yeah, we have to continue playing. 

00:21:52.946 --> 00:21:58.840
 That probably took me longer than the length of the film. 

00:21:58.840 --> 00:22:00.153
 Ok, who is this little boy? 

00:22:00.153 --> 00:22:02.489
 I just know that it’s a kid, do you understand? 

00:22:07.794 --> 00:22:10.797
 What do you sell for 10,000 different dishes? Machine? 

00:22:11.865 --> 00:22:14.334
 Sorry, let me introduce you in more detail. 

00:22:14.334 --> 00:22:17.700
 I am introducing the robot 

00:22:19.239 --> 00:22:23.677
 Hey, is this one of the display machines? Am I? 

00:22:25.812 --> 00:22:27.614
 I’m so appreciative. 

00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:32.886
 Are they going to choose me? 

00:22:33.353 --> 00:22:36.623
 This one will hit a pistol very much. 

00:22:44.564 --> 00:22:46.332
 I mean it sounds good. 

00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.370
 Does that one know how to dance Fornite dance? 

00:22:54.740 --> 00:22:56.576
 Oh, really, can you dance L? 

00:22:56.576 --> 00:22:59.446
 That is definitely where I am going. 

00:22:59.446 --> 00:23:01.348
 Oh, don’t buy me. 

00:23:04.651 --> 00:23:05.952
 Oh, I am sending it for repair. 

00:23:19.332 --> 00:23:21.935
 Oh, damn, I don’t know what will happen. 

00:23:25.638 --> 00:23:28.708
 I want to call the chrysanthemum chrysanthemum 

00:23:28.708 --> 00:23:30.977
 Poop chrysanthemum 

00:23:30.977 --> 00:23:32.746
 Damn!!! I am a woman!? 

00:23:34.347 --> 00:23:37.984
 Kara? Good and innocent. 

00:23:38.685 --> 00:23:41.388
 God 

00:23:42.355 --> 00:23:44.900
 Is this a re-arrangement? 

00:23:47.930 --> 00:23:49.229
 This is the soundtrack of a movie. 

00:23:49.963 --> 00:23:52.365
 I don't know if David Cage is still assisting in making 

00:23:52.365 --> 00:23:54.670
 Is he called David Cage? 

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:59.539
 He is the first video game maker 

00:23:59.539 --> 00:24:01.808
 Want to make a game that looks like a movie 

00:24:01.808 --> 00:24:04.878
 If you played his first work, it’s actually the second one. 

00:24:04.878 --> 00:24:08.140
 What is it called? (Phantom killer) Message to help me I forgot 

00:24:08.140 --> 00:24:12.520
 Hey, I remember what you played. 

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:14.988
 Will show you playing movies and rewinding things like 

00:24:14.988 --> 00:24:17.490
 In fact, the game is very fun. 

00:24:17.490 --> 00:24:20.226
 Do you remember? Have you seen me play? 

00:24:20.226 --> 00:24:23.290
 It’s been a long time ago, it’s really fun. 

00:24:24.898 --> 00:24:26.733
 Time really passed for a long time 

00:24:26.733 --> 00:24:32.238
 It’s amazing to see the progress of the game’s progress over the years. 

00:24:33.907 --> 00:24:37.277
 It seems that they are also a bit of reference. 

00:24:37.277 --> 00:24:40.347
 The last game is not that bad, but it is... 

00:24:40.347 --> 00:24:43.249
 Not a good idea 

00:24:44.217 --> 00:24:46.820
 They want to make the game look like a movie too. 

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:50.123
 I think "Super Killer: Two Souls" is their first previous one. 

00:24:50.123 --> 00:24:54.928
 They used the model of the festival to make it? 

00:24:59.366 --> 00:25:02.669
 If you have robots, how would you use it? 

00:25:05.672 --> 00:25:10.377
 It’s weird if you use VR to play 

00:25:10.377 --> 00:25:15.348
 It’s fun to see other enemies or people playing around. 

00:25:15.348 --> 00:25:18.485
 If you have a robot, you should do the same. 

00:25:18.485 --> 00:25:21.621
 OK, so David Cage is also a producer, of course. 

00:25:21.621 --> 00:25:26.920
 Hahaha... 

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:29.929
 Another feature of this game is that they make the picture look incredible. 

00:25:29.929 --> 00:25:33.466
 Then just finished, it’s a very ugly tree. 

00:25:33.466 --> 00:25:37.300
 Face of the character's face animated character 

00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:42.375
 I remember playing "Rainstorm" when I haven't played YouTube yet. 

00:25:42.375 --> 00:25:45.178
 I spent my savings to buy that game. 

00:25:45.178 --> 00:25:51.685
 I bought PS3 and "Rainstorm" I really enjoyed it very much. 

00:25:51.685 --> 00:25:55.922
 That is a time when I am still alive. 

00:25:58.124 --> 00:26:00.427
 Playing games is a conduit to escape reality 

00:26:04.464 --> 00:26:06.766
 Ok, now I am this person, I don’t know why. 

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.738
 Sorry, I like to talk about my own things. What can you do? 

00:26:12.439 --> 00:26:16.609
 There is currently no task to get back the order number 66... 

00:26:18.478 --> 00:26:21.481
 I am going to the Bellini paint shop. 

00:26:22.349 --> 00:26:23.316
 OK 

00:26:26.119 --> 00:26:30.230
 So he sent his robot to run errands? 

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.559
 It looks so cool! 

00:26:32.559 --> 00:26:34.828
 Plastic retardation 

00:26:35.528 --> 00:26:39.650
 We exclude racial discrimination by robots 

00:26:39.650 --> 00:26:40.667
 Now you can hate them directly. 

00:26:40.667 --> 00:26:43.803
 Positioned by satellite according to R2 

00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:49.209
 Bellini paint is not here, good to everyone here. 

00:26:53.130 --> 00:26:54.881
 Hot dog~ 

00:26:56.483 --> 00:26:59.152
 Ok, you are doing a bad job as a robot. 

00:27:03.957 --> 00:27:05.392
 Open your eyes 

00:27:07.927 --> 00:27:08.928
 brothers 

00:27:11.531 --> 00:27:15.101
 There is no sentence in the brain when you can’t swear. 

00:27:16.236 --> 00:27:17.737
 Come check it out 

00:27:23.677 --> 00:27:25.145
 Oh, are you? 

00:27:30.483 --> 00:27:32.919
 Which button can be used for Dab? 

00:27:35.155 --> 00:27:37.724
 Forgot me for us in Detroit 

00:27:37.724 --> 00:27:40.260
 He is the man on the cover, right? 

00:27:45.799 --> 00:27:50.370
 It seems that there are issues involving black slaves here. 

00:27:51.171 --> 00:27:53.873
 Maybe I will talk about these topics again, I don’t know. 

00:27:58.578 --> 00:28:01.981
 Where is the good idiot paint shop? It’s here. 

00:28:01.981 --> 00:28:07.721
 Bellini pigment store is very good since 2009~ 

00:28:12.425 --> 00:28:15.695
 Hello~ 

00:28:15.695 --> 00:28:18.365
 Please give me the best paint thank you~ 

00:28:21.434 --> 00:28:23.503
 He is also a robot. 

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:31.911
 Hahaha 

00:28:35.415 --> 00:28:39.285
 Hey, this is the picture of the game cover. 

00:28:45.759 --> 00:28:50.430
 You probably heard that you can put something like a wafer into your hand. 

00:28:50.430 --> 00:28:54.768
 Then there are not many places where you can pay through the chip. 

00:28:57.300 --> 00:28:59.706
 The control of the game is still as good as ever. 

00:28:59.706 --> 00:29:03.476
 Have you ever done this kind of thing? Want to pay like this? 

00:29:08.948 --> 00:29:13.920
 Things that look crazy now may be very common in the future. 

00:29:19.359 --> 00:29:22.328
 Interestingly, the way to pay now is already very embarrassing. 

00:29:22.929 --> 00:29:25.932
 Like your stored value in the card, pen 

00:29:25.932 --> 00:29:27.734
 Awkward waiting 

00:29:29.636 --> 00:29:35.410
 Every time I am waiting for payment, I have to wait for the machine, right? 

00:29:35.410 --> 00:29:37.877
 Every time I think I have to say a little bit. 

00:29:37.877 --> 00:29:40.547
 Or do I have to stare at the machine empty? 

00:29:40.547 --> 00:29:42.482
 I have this difficulty every time. 

00:29:42.482 --> 00:29:46.190
 What about you? Please tell me I want to know that I really want to know 

00:29:46.190 --> 00:29:50.590
 Because it’s really embarrassing? Time is long enough to talk 

00:29:50.590 --> 00:29:55.128
 Don’t tell me that it’s too much time, it’s strange that you don’t talk. 

00:29:55.895 --> 00:29:58.698
 Hey, no one wants to know that I understand. 

00:29:59.599 --> 00:30:01.267
 Why do you hate me? 

00:30:04.170 --> 00:30:06.439
 I mean, the robot is full of streets, I don’t know why. 

00:30:06.439 --> 00:30:07.674
 Hehehehe 

00:30:07.674 --> 00:30:09.776
欸欸

00:30:09.776 --> 00:30:12.479
 My God, don’t swear, please. 

00:30:12.479 --> 00:30:15.448
 Grabbed our work @#$&amp; 

00:30:19.285 --> 00:30:23.456
 No, he doesn't know Kung Fu? Hurry up to download some moves. 

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:30.630
 You grab this job~ 

00:30:45.378 --> 00:30:46.946
 Ha ha 

00:30:50.650 --> 00:30:52.752
 Destroy it, right? 

00:31:01.261 --> 00:31:04.898
 It sounds like you don’t need to work if someone helps you with things. 

00:31:04.898 --> 00:31:07.133
 It’s okay to buy a robot, right? 

00:31:07.133 --> 00:31:11.504
 Then let them work for you and you can still make it awesome. 

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:17.544
 Ok, where am I going? 

00:31:18.110 --> 00:31:19.813
 Hey, I have to take a bus. 

00:31:19.813 --> 00:31:24.784
 You know that everyone always hates devastating technology. 

00:31:24.784 --> 00:31:28.321
 At least because everyone will be unemployed, it is understandable. 

00:31:30.690 --> 00:31:34.894
 But technology can bring more work 

00:31:34.894 --> 00:31:38.498
 This is a cyclical process that we will continue to experience. 

00:31:48.575 --> 00:31:52.746
 Just like we used to farm and then we can develop machines that can be farmed. 

00:31:55.415 --> 00:31:57.584
 Hey, are they right? 

00:31:57.584 --> 00:32:00.553
 This is absolutely the same as the incident of Rosa Louise. 

00:32:00.553 --> 00:32:03.123
 They must have their own independent space on the bus 

00:32:17.337 --> 00:32:19.939
 Nothing makes sense 

00:32:20.740 --> 00:32:23.430
 Ok, so wait 

00:32:23.977 --> 00:32:28.314
 Nothing else, but we should be able to explore more places. 

00:32:28.314 --> 00:32:31.685
 Then Marcus took the bus and everyone. 

00:32:31.685 --> 00:32:34.954
 It’s so interesting. This reminds me of Rainstorm. 

00:32:39.659 --> 00:32:43.630
 Do you know? Maybe you guys are jealous of this guy. 

00:32:43.630 --> 00:32:47.367
 But I am sure he is a good person, I am sure he will take good care of us. 

00:32:47.367 --> 00:32:51.370
 It’s so exciting, but how did he buy her? 

00:33:11.324 --> 00:33:13.259
 I am coming back~ 

00:33:13.259 --> 00:33:16.290
 Press R1 to switch the screen view 

00:33:18.164 --> 00:33:22.335
 Too much, you have to control your rocker. 

00:33:22.335 --> 00:33:25.505
 Hello, everyone, I am a game player. 

00:33:27.507 --> 00:33:29.409
 Oh, it’s not my fault. 

00:33:35.150 --> 00:33:38.518
 It’s swearing! Don’t be jealous!!! 

00:33:55.101 --> 00:33:58.405
 I very much hope that I will not go to pornography. 

00:33:59.205 --> 00:34:02.750
 Press R2 to scan the environment OK. 

00:34:02.750 --> 00:34:06.846
 We have to clean up, thank you for the game, this is the game, okay? 

00:34:06.846 --> 00:34:09.416
 When a woman's simulator 

00:34:12.352 --> 00:34:14.354
 I'm just kidding!!!!!!!!!!!! 

00:34:14.354 --> 00:34:18.658
 Good to collect garbage, kitchen, what do we have to clear? 

00:34:18.658 --> 00:34:19.759
 Hey, let's throw it directly? 

00:34:19.759 --> 00:34:24.898
 No one has cleaned up your garbage from this big fool. 

00:34:24.898 --> 00:34:27.300
 What should I do now? How to put it down? 

00:34:28.568 --> 00:34:30.503
 Good for you 

00:34:37.711 --> 00:34:40.747
 Good clean up the front desk 

00:34:42.515 --> 00:34:44.851
 Where is it? 噢

00:34:46.686 --> 00:34:50.256
 You disgusted brother, you are disgusting, you are dirty 

00:34:52.250 --> 00:34:55.528
 Disgusting, she just throws the plate away, right? Look. 

00:34:56.563 --> 00:34:59.899
 Why can you wash the dishes with dab dishes? 

00:34:59.899 --> 00:35:02.502
 Clean up the coffee table coffee table here 

00:35:03.236 --> 00:35:06.390
 Sorry, haha~ 

00:35:06.390 --> 00:35:09.676
 TV is open~ 

00:35:12.412 --> 00:35:14.981
 This guy eats a lot of pizza. 

00:35:14.981 --> 00:35:18.618
 How did she put those pizza cartons into the garbage bag? 

00:35:18.618 --> 00:35:21.821
 What is this magical.. cardboard.. 

00:35:21.821 --> 00:35:23.656
 And you can't put two mixes.. 喔

00:35:23.656 --> 00:35:28.228
 OK, she thanked God with two bags.. I am very responsible for the future. 

00:35:29.162 --> 00:35:32.732
 A credit card application form is good 

00:35:32.732 --> 00:35:34.801
 The bank did not accept... 

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:39.773
 Do you know.. If I have those lists, I might also.. 

00:35:39.773 --> 00:35:42.142
喔真尴尬This remote control.. Originally you went this direction.. 

00:35:42.142 --> 00:35:47.447
 Then suddenly I went in the opposite direction and then started walking again.. 

00:35:47.447 --> 00:35:49.315
 Anyway~! I know you don't care. 

00:35:55.689 --> 00:35:57.257
 Look at it 

00:36:06.199 --> 00:36:09.636
 Is it that Detroit has such a bad community, isn't it? 

00:36:09.636 --> 00:36:12.172
 No? Is that true? 

00:36:15.875 --> 00:36:18.611
 I know that movie.. 

00:36:18.611 --> 00:36:21.247
 We have to be very quiet and have a blind person. 

00:36:21.247 --> 00:36:23.917
 Let me think.. This house reminds me of the movie (temporarily stop breathing) 

00:36:23.917 --> 00:36:27.721
 You are very welcome, I am very clear. 

00:36:30.657 --> 00:36:32.959
 TV, stupid, do you think Le? 

00:36:32.959 --> 00:36:35.295
 Hey, give it to me.. Ah! Ah!! 

00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:40.133
 Oh, sorry, do I like to have problems with hockey? 

00:36:40.133 --> 00:36:42.702
 He has a curved screen digging 

00:36:42.702 --> 00:36:44.938
 Ok, let's talk to her. 

00:36:45.839 --> 00:36:48.174
 Ok, don't talk to her, God. 

00:36:48.174 --> 00:36:50.443
 What else do we want to clear? 

00:36:50.443 --> 00:36:52.746
 Return with Todd 

00:36:55.682 --> 00:36:58.651
 Dishwasher: start the vacuum cleaner 

00:36:58.651 --> 00:37:01.121
 Branch (line) mission! 

00:37:01.121 --> 00:37:03.323
 Of course, we have to suck the floor. 

00:37:03.323 --> 00:37:05.525
 What do you think is this? Play games? 

00:37:05.525 --> 00:37:08.762
 No! I care about cleaning. 

00:37:09.963 --> 00:37:12.320
 Is he numb? 

00:37:12.432 --> 00:37:14.567
 What is that sound? 

00:37:15.368 --> 00:37:18.471
 What is your problem? It seems that it is in the drug? 

00:37:31.317 --> 00:37:33.987
 I like to help you clean~ 

00:37:33.987 --> 00:37:37.900
喔Todd Todd is the best ㄌ~ 

00:37:39.225 --> 00:37:41.695
 Upstairs, everyone 

00:37:44.464 --> 00:37:47.701
 Can't I clear this? It looks like... 

00:37:47.701 --> 00:37:50.337
 So what can you not make that kind of voice...? 

00:37:50.337 --> 00:37:54.740
 Good to make the bed to let the room ventilate..? 

00:37:55.642 --> 00:37:58.645
 That's why you want to watch the game live. 

00:37:58.645 --> 00:38:03.149
 It’s better to see someone cleaning things in the game. 

00:38:04.617 --> 00:38:06.353
 God, she really will make the bed. 

00:38:06.353 --> 00:38:08.421
 Seeing this is my dream, I hate to sort the bed. 

00:38:08.421 --> 00:38:11.157
 This is one of the things I hate to do. 

00:38:11.157 --> 00:38:14.728
 If my quilt is not flattened, I can't sleep. 

00:38:14.728 --> 00:38:17.630
 So I have to adjust often I hate that OK? 

00:38:17.630 --> 00:38:20.467
 Why can't we invent better quilts? Please 

00:38:20.467 --> 00:38:24.700
 Who is going to find a way... or a robot 

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:26.406
 Not asking you to buy a robot... 

00:38:29.476 --> 00:38:32.278
 I feel very strange... 

00:38:32.278 --> 00:38:35.248
 I don't like having a cleaning maid or something like that. 

00:38:35.248 --> 00:38:37.183
 If the cleaning maid has a male... 

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:41.921
 Just don't like to let other people do things for me. 

00:38:41.921 --> 00:38:45.191
 But I like the machine to do things for me. 

00:38:46.159 --> 00:38:50.597
 I don't know why... It's like a dishwasher... I am very happy. 

00:38:50.597 --> 00:38:52.665
 I feel very good. 

00:38:54.167 --> 00:38:56.670
 I don't care about this, how can I leave? 

00:39:03.476 --> 00:39:07.647
 Have you tried a 3D printer? It’s always fun to watch it work. 

00:39:10.450 --> 00:39:12.252
 Why should I open it? 

00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:16.289
 I use my head to open 

00:39:18.958 --> 00:39:20.960
 This channel likes yellow very much. 

00:39:29.936 --> 00:39:33.973
 So there are some power issues between robots and humans. 

00:39:49.155 --> 00:39:50.757
 Interesting 

00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:55.628
 There are twenty more... 250,000 people are unemployed? 

00:39:58.164 --> 00:40:01.000
 Ok, we know there are a lot of controversies. 

00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:03.236
 We have to come to the wind 

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:05.572
 That's exactly what I want to order. 

00:40:12.312 --> 00:40:16.316
 Tian Ah feels that I am sorting things in real life. 

00:40:19.686 --> 00:40:21.988
 Ok, what is this? 

00:40:23.823 --> 00:40:27.861
 What is this? Is it me? 

00:40:36.360 --> 00:40:37.437
 definitely is.. 

00:40:38.304 --> 00:40:42.242
 OK Todd's room is complete 

00:40:43.343 --> 00:40:44.544
 We are all finished 

00:40:45.979 --> 00:40:46.913
 what did I do!? 

00:40:48.810 --> 00:40:53.286
 I love Todd, really like him, I love Todd, he is awesome. 

00:40:53.286 --> 00:40:58.792
 The toilet was blocked by Todd's poop. Todd was the best. I love Todd. 

00:41:01.928 --> 00:41:06.366
 The spur line task is cool, are we going to do the spur task? 

00:41:06.366 --> 00:41:09.102
 are you kidding me?? 

00:41:09.669 --> 00:41:12.172
 Is there an option for me to choose what to clear? 

00:41:15.975 --> 00:41:19.412
 Yes, I just cleaned it. 

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:26.519
 Can't you teach a child to do it yourself? 

00:41:32.392 --> 00:41:34.361
嘿Alice 

00:41:34.361 --> 00:41:37.163
 Finishing your room, you stupid 

00:41:37.163 --> 00:41:38.965
 I am doing these shit! 

00:41:44.704 --> 00:41:47.140
 That is something that unlocks the future. 

00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:51.511
 I have to escape, right? 

00:41:51.511 --> 00:41:53.580
 Hello Alice 

00:41:55.415 --> 00:41:57.984
 "real" "friendly" "courteous" friendly? 

00:42:07.327 --> 00:42:09.229
 What do you like? 

00:42:15.668 --> 00:42:17.303
 (laughs) 尴尬

00:42:17.303 --> 00:42:18.304
 What about your mother? 

00:42:21.875 --> 00:42:23.543
喔噢

00:42:24.511 --> 00:42:25.912
 Oh my name is Kara. 

00:42:37.490 --> 00:42:39.392
 Good job 

00:42:42.696 --> 00:42:44.631
 What did she give me? 

00:42:45.398 --> 00:42:46.900
 Paper strip? 

00:42:47.701 --> 00:42:49.200
 It is the key! 

00:42:50.303 --> 00:42:52.605
 Where is the key to?? 

00:42:56.643 --> 00:42:59.646
 Kara thought: I love the key... 

00:42:59.646 --> 00:43:01.514
 I love the key... 

00:43:01.514 --> 00:43:03.717
 Ask Todd! 

00:43:03.717 --> 00:43:06.720
 Ok, so this is my memory. 

00:43:21.434 --> 00:43:23.703
 Jacksepticeye... 

00:43:23.703 --> 00:43:26.706
 I know that I can't get rid of him... 

00:43:26.706 --> 00:43:29.420
 That little bastard 

00:43:30.100 --> 00:43:31.411
 Is that the mother? 

00:43:31.411 --> 00:43:35.515
 Is that Todd? How does it look so good? 

00:43:45.525 --> 00:43:48.828
 Then a little pigment on her head 

00:43:50.697 --> 00:43:55.602
 Dad doesn’t like sportswear. 

00:43:55.602 --> 00:43:59.739
 Then Dad patted her... day... 

00:44:01.708 --> 00:44:04.577
 Then my arm is broken!? 

00:44:04.577 --> 00:44:06.846
 My goodness... 

00:44:13.486 --> 00:44:15.455
 Let's go back. 

00:44:24.230 --> 00:44:27.300
 I don’t know if I was hit by a car... 

00:44:32.672 --> 00:44:35.709
 Alice in Wonderland! 

00:44:35.709 --> 00:44:37.811
 It seems to be written by the author living in Brighton. 

00:44:37.811 --> 00:44:39.813
 Someone told me that I don’t know if it’s true or not. 

00:44:40.413 --> 00:44:43.450
 I live in Brighton... 

00:44:43.450 --> 00:44:46.786
 There seems to be a lot of things I don't know if there really is a lot... 

00:44:46.786 --> 00:44:50.323
 Someone covered the tunnel on the other side of the tunnel. 

00:44:51.524 --> 00:44:55.280
 I don't know if it is really more and more I think it is a lie. 

00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:58.798
 I heard that the tunnel is... 

00:44:58.798 --> 00:45:02.635
 Just let the author write the inspiration of Alice, I don’t know. 

00:45:02.635 --> 00:45:05.405
 Clean up the toilet 

00:45:05.405 --> 00:45:08.608
 I mean, anyway, I’m here, we’re here. 

00:45:08.608 --> 00:45:11.945
 I am sure that you really like to hear me say some five four three. 

00:45:11.945 --> 00:45:15.882
 So why not clean up the neat shampoo? 

00:45:18.651 --> 00:45:21.988
 And the more I think about it, the more people don’t need to have a robot. 

00:45:21.988 --> 00:45:22.922
 What you need is a woman 

00:45:22.922 --> 00:45:27.930
 I am joking!!!! That is a joke!!!!!!! 

00:45:31.297 --> 00:45:33.600
 How is this mop small like a fart? 

00:45:36.369 --> 00:45:38.738
 My good day, my god. 

00:45:39.506 --> 00:45:41.975
 Why are you why? 

00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.712
 Hey, I have to keep turning. 

00:45:52.352 --> 00:45:56.560
 Ok, we solved all the work. 

00:45:56.560 --> 00:45:59.225
 It’s time to proceed to the next step. Felix 

00:45:59.225 --> 00:46:02.620
 Ok!! God. 

00:46:02.629 --> 00:46:05.131
 I just want to play a little more thoroughly. 

00:46:05.131 --> 00:46:08.935
 I have a lot of fun and fun. 

00:46:11.471 --> 00:46:12.939
 Otherwise what do you think I am doing? 

00:46:19.646 --> 00:46:21.715
 Right, that’s right. 

00:46:22.315 --> 00:46:23.983
 Don't swear 

00:46:25.285 --> 00:46:27.887
 But you bought the robot 

00:46:54.714 --> 00:46:57.350
 I love Todd~ Todd is the best~ 

00:47:01.721 --> 00:47:03.490
 God... 

00:47:09.562 --> 00:47:12.265
 Where is the Dab button? 

00:47:12.265 --> 00:47:16.636
 If this game doesn't make me a moment of Dab 

00:47:16.636 --> 00:47:19.639
 I will definitely be very disappointed!!! 

00:47:19.639 --> 00:47:21.841
 With it! Look 

00:47:21.841 --> 00:47:24.177
 I missed one! No!!!!!! 

00:47:24.177 --> 00:47:27.514
 No!!!!!!! Damn!!!!!!!! 

00:47:27.514 --> 00:47:30.250
 Ah... I am a robot, let's continue. 

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:33.620
 Let's play another story, okay, one more. 

00:47:33.620 --> 00:47:36.589
 Come again, come on. 

00:47:37.424 --> 00:47:40.226
 7 am ~ not at all 

00:47:40.226 --> 00:47:42.996
 Wake up in the morning~ 

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:50.360
 Cyberlife founder Mark Zuckerberg 

00:47:55.675 --> 00:47:57.177
 nest 

00:47:58.278 --> 00:48:02.382
 If you have the money to buy a bunch of robots, you will be super handsome! 

00:48:02.382 --> 00:48:04.818
 Then you can let them fight like Pokémon! 

00:48:05.652 --> 00:48:07.354
 That would be great 

00:48:07.354 --> 00:48:09.723
 Too bad 

00:48:10.623 --> 00:48:14.361
 If you do the robot, you can make a dream. 

00:48:14.361 --> 00:48:16.830
 Bao Ke Meng is the inspiration for this game. 

00:48:19.990 --> 00:48:22.702
 Carl, I dare say that Carl is also a fool. 

00:48:22.702 --> 00:48:25.839
 The children of rich families are stupid 

00:48:25.839 --> 00:48:30.310
 What is this on the wall? 喔 is the kind of elevator 

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:32.545
 This picture is really big. 

00:48:34.647 --> 00:48:36.783
 Stupid 

00:48:38.318 --> 00:48:40.200
 My stupid? 

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:43.590
 Going upstairs to wake up Carl, I am already upstairs, isn't it? 

00:48:44.657 --> 00:48:48.528
 Ancient fossils at home 

00:48:48.528 --> 00:48:50.163
 Just like everyone else 

00:48:50.163 --> 00:48:52.799
 Wo automatic door! Too bad! 

00:48:55.668 --> 00:48:58.171
 Carl is... old man? 

00:48:58.171 --> 00:49:02.709
 Carl is an old man!! And there are tattoos! 

00:49:25.832 --> 00:49:28.101
 Hehehe because you will not forget? 

00:49:29.135 --> 00:49:32.272
 My goodness! Just like me! 

00:49:33.373 --> 00:49:36.876
 So when can I draw a picture? Because I think 

00:49:36.876 --> 00:49:39.346
 We can just finish the live situation when we draw the picture, right? 

00:49:39.346 --> 00:49:42.382
 Hehehe, this is the key point. 

00:49:47.530 --> 00:49:48.521
 Carl! 

00:50:09.342 --> 00:50:10.610
 Ah 

00:50:30.196 --> 00:50:33.466
 One of the best employers of robots so far 

00:50:33.466 --> 00:50:38.380
 I’m still criticizing Carl, I feel so bad. 

00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:45.450
 Please don’t let me do that. 

00:50:47.847 --> 00:50:50.917
 Have you seen the movie "Cloud Lovers"? 

00:50:50.917 --> 00:50:55.955
 Is a great movie depicting humans and... 

00:50:55.955 --> 00:50:59.959
 Artificial intelligence AI? Robot? Emotion 

00:50:59.959 --> 00:51:05.331
 I am curious if this game will tell you that they have a very close feeling. 

00:51:05.999 --> 00:51:08.601
 Like the movie, that cat is really ugly. 

00:51:12.672 --> 00:51:14.407
 What is this action? I have to... 

00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:23.650
 This game creates a great atmosphere 

00:51:29.556 --> 00:51:33.860
 I don't like Carl's paintings first. 

00:51:37.664 --> 00:51:40.133
咿嘻嘻嘻嘻

00:51:41.101 --> 00:51:42.335
 Oh 

00:51:48.742 --> 00:51:51.770
 Now let him take the elevator. 

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:53.980
 Or we have the option to push him down 

00:52:01.321 --> 00:52:04.991
 It’s so cool, the nest is fast! 

00:52:06.226 --> 00:52:10.130
 I am faster than I am walking! I want one more! Hahaha 

00:52:11.564 --> 00:52:14.267
 OK So I continue to push him still? 

00:52:14.267 --> 00:52:17.470
 It’s so great for me to move to him behind me. 

00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.246
 Automatic door 

00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:29.449
 This TV is so cool! 

00:52:32.519 --> 00:52:35.689
 You are welcome to be the same as I said! 

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:49.369
 OK So we have to have breakfast? Or? 

00:52:50.236 --> 00:52:54.474
 I don't know how to make scrambled eggs. I don't like to eat eggs. 

00:52:55.608 --> 00:52:58.178
 Oh, I’m already thankful. 

00:52:59.112 --> 00:53:02.150
 This game will definitely ruin me. 

00:53:03.983 --> 00:53:06.653
 Ok, what about the mug? 

00:53:06.653 --> 00:53:09.322
 Is that his child? 

00:53:10.357 --> 00:53:13.626
 He has that kind! The faucet tied to the wall 

00:53:13.626 --> 00:53:16.529
 This is called a good savage 

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.376
 Please see 

00:53:34.140 --> 00:53:39.586
 If he is not in good health, can he give him bacon and eggs? 

00:53:39.586 --> 00:53:41.921
 Just ask, okay? You can eat oatmeal. 

00:53:41.921 --> 00:53:44.240
 Oatmeal is also good and delicious. 

00:53:44.657 --> 00:53:47.227
 It’s great to promote bowel movement right away. 

00:53:50.163 --> 00:53:52.465
 He hasn't touched that... 

00:53:53.533 --> 00:53:55.902
 Eat fruit, Carl! 

00:53:58.538 --> 00:54:01.207
 That is a double-sided TV is too embarrassing! 

00:54:02.750 --> 00:54:05.512
 Looking for something to do, what do I have to do? 

00:54:09.150 --> 00:54:13.319
 Other games will have that kind of character dialogue when you get lost. 

00:54:13.319 --> 00:54:15.488
 I think this game is not available. 

00:54:16.589 --> 00:54:18.825
 Why do the Russians want to swallow in the Arctic? 

00:54:19.659 --> 00:54:22.462
 We *嗝* need territory in outer space 

00:54:22.462 --> 00:54:26.366
 There are signs of life on the Titans. 

00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:30.470
 What is this thing talking about? 

00:54:30.470 --> 00:54:33.606
 What is Titan Star? 

00:54:40.847 --> 00:54:42.916
 Pretty cool 

00:54:44.170 --> 00:54:45.251
 damn it 

00:54:48.321 --> 00:54:51.858
 It seems that there is nothing to change in the future. 

00:54:58.465 --> 00:55:01.368
 and many more 

00:55:02.969 --> 00:55:05.238
 How many years is it now? 

00:55:09.376 --> 00:55:12.879
 My good partner! The whiskey of the whole car~ 

00:55:13.913 --> 00:55:17.150
 The bottle is not... not fake 

00:55:17.150 --> 00:55:19.619
 I thought that there would be fake brands. 

00:55:20.487 --> 00:55:22.856
 Like an animation 

00:55:22.856 --> 00:55:25.558
 OK, let's play a good piano. 

00:55:29.262 --> 00:55:34.601
 DEEE SPACITO #$&amp;^@%&amp;# 

00:55:35.168 --> 00:55:37.871
 "sorrowful" "hopeful" "excited" 

00:55:37.871 --> 00:55:42.676
 Well, he makes people feel a bit... 

00:55:42.676 --> 00:55:45.378
 Give him some hope, okay? 

00:55:49.349 --> 00:55:52.285
 By the way, I am pushing the button while I am playing. 

00:55:55.422 --> 00:55:57.724
 Oh, hahahahaha 

00:56:09.369 --> 00:56:13.139
 Do you like it? DE~Spacito～ 

00:56:17.644 --> 00:56:19.913
 Ok, are you like it? 

00:56:24.517 --> 00:56:26.519
 Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:56:43.903 --> 00:56:45.171
 he is... 

00:57:02.122 --> 00:57:03.256
 Ok we go to the studio 

00:57:03.256 --> 00:57:05.191
 !!! To start!!!! 

00:57:06.393 --> 00:57:08.862
 Yeah~屎~ 

00:57:08.862 --> 00:57:11.998
 Why are there stairs? Is that a giraffe?? 

00:57:14.134 --> 00:57:16.169
 Why not? 

00:57:16.169 --> 00:57:18.138
 Why not? What is it? 

00:57:19.973 --> 00:57:22.308
 Even the old swan~ 

00:57:22.308 --> 00:57:27.347
 I can't wait, I can finally see what the picture looks like. 

00:57:27.347 --> 00:57:30.617
 Waited for so long... 

00:57:34.487 --> 00:57:36.956
 What's the situation now? 

00:57:42.328 --> 00:57:44.597
 Want me to pull? 

00:57:50.670 --> 00:57:52.739
 Ok, this is much more beautiful. 

00:58:00.580 --> 00:58:03.416
 Hey, we have to clean up the work when he waits for him to draw. 

00:58:03.416 --> 00:58:05.952
 so cool 

00:58:05.952 --> 00:58:07.870
 Looks terrible 

00:58:09.322 --> 00:58:11.858
 Then what do I have to clean up? 

00:58:25.138 --> 00:58:27.273
 What else? 

00:58:28.808 --> 00:58:32.479
 I have a very fun sweeping simulator. I have a good time. 

00:58:38.852 --> 00:58:42.155
 Please give me more options to clean up. 

00:58:48.795 --> 00:58:51.364
 Clap ~ 

00:58:51.364 --> 00:58:54.601
 What else to clear? 

00:58:54.601 --> 00:58:57.170
 Don't care, don't care for me. 

00:58:57.170 --> 00:58:58.304
 Ok, there 

00:59:02.420 --> 00:59:04.511
 Give me something, I didn’t think I would say this. 

00:59:04.511 --> 00:59:06.146
 Oh 

00:59:06.146 --> 00:59:09.490
 Is it enough for me to clean up? 

00:59:09.490 --> 00:59:11.751
 Give me a fascination, give me a fascination, give me a mystery! 

00:59:27.434 --> 00:59:30.270
 Oh... I like it. 

00:59:58.965 --> 01:00:01.201
 That's right!!! 

01:00:01.201 --> 01:00:03.670
 Are you saying that you have never been curious? 

01:00:11.578 --> 01:00:16.516
 Grace, I am really curious about what kind of pattern. 

01:00:19.719 --> 01:00:21.354
 Ok 

01:00:26.893 --> 01:00:32.399
 Find a sample you are saying with my... 

01:00:32.399 --> 01:00:35.869
 Why can't you paint what you want to draw? 

01:00:35.869 --> 01:00:38.204
 Painting Carl's picture is pretty cool 

01:00:39.406 --> 01:00:45.145
 Hey... the desktop looks boring 

01:00:45.145 --> 01:00:48.148
 We chose the statue, we are going to draw 

01:00:48.148 --> 01:00:50.817
 Let me paint~ 

01:00:54.554 --> 01:00:57.724
 Painting is such a thing, I am afraid that you do not know that this is 

01:00:57.724 --> 01:01:01.294
 Finally, why didn't a game be painted? 

01:01:02.729 --> 01:01:06.332
 Really show the art of painting 

01:01:06.332 --> 01:01:10.670
 My God, my God. 

01:01:14.507 --> 01:01:15.809
 what? 

01:01:17.477 --> 01:01:20.747
 That's right! Ok, we haven't got there yet. 

01:01:36.296 --> 01:01:38.398
 Let's come and let us know 

01:01:43.503 --> 01:01:45.205
 This is a big picture 

01:02:09.129 --> 01:02:12.832
 Started!! I am ready!! 

01:02:14.100 --> 01:02:16.569
 Hey, do I still have to choose? 

01:02:18.772 --> 01:02:21.641
 How does it look at robots? 

01:02:22.800 --> 01:02:23.510
 With hope 

01:02:27.781 --> 01:02:30.250
 I hope I will make him amazing. 

01:02:51.671 --> 01:02:53.173
 Faster 

01:02:58.440 --> 01:03:00.280
 My goodness... 

01:03:02.615 --> 01:03:05.518
 Hehehehehe 

01:03:05.518 --> 01:03:07.754
 Who is this idiot? 

01:04:25.131 --> 01:04:27.834
 Pay attention to your language Leo please 

01:04:42.682 --> 01:04:44.751
 Dab Dab Dab Dab 

01:04:44.751 --> 01:04:45.652
 hateful 

01:04:54.694 --> 01:04:57.397
 Good guys, come here. 

01:04:57.397 --> 01:05:00.700
 The first episode is over! 

01:05:01.301 --> 01:05:04.137
 I like it very much, I hope that you too. 

01:05:04.137 --> 01:05:07.807
 If you see it last, please help me press it. 

01:05:07.807 --> 01:05:10.377
 I will thank you very much. 

01:05:10.377 --> 01:05:14.180
 See us tomorrow for a new episode 

01:05:14.180 --> 01:05:15.810
掰~
