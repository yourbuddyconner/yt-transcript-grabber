00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.250
When Facebook claimed they could resurrect
the dead, the world laughed.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.620
But Facebook were entirely serious.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.900
Their technology was proprietary, they said,
but the details leaked out soon enough.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.170
They took a copy of every digital trace of
you.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.560
Every email in your archive, every photo and
video you took or appeared in, every web page

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.410
you visited, every keystroke you typed.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.340
Your location history, social network history,
everything, built up over decades.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:28.590
The people who'd grown up with the internet
were in their forties and fifties now, and

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.269
their old data was still in the systems.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:36.110
From there, Facebook built up a model, petabytes
and exabytes in size, that could approximate

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:37.110
the way you'd respond.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.690
It wasn't a quick or easy process, but it
worked.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.550
The technology came from a company that wanted
to design virtual assistants, something for

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.330
people who receive too much email.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:48.720
Who better to trust your email to than yourself?

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.760
The trouble was this: the models received
the input, updated themselves, and spat out

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.560
a vaguely coherent set of sentence fragments
and concepts in reply.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.850
That had to be typed up into English by remote
translators, and then that text had to be

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.590
run through the model again so the vocabulary
and grammar would match the original person.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.619
So as virtual assistants they were slow and
expensive, and anyone with the money and need

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.479
would just, well, hire an actual assistant
instead.

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.200
Facebook originally bought the company with
the hope of automatically testing reactions

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.729
to targeted adverts - and then some bright
spark realised that the original subject didn't

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:25.030
need to be alive any more.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.439
This was their proposal: after you died, your
friends and relatives could still send you

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:30.439
messages.

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.729
They could ask for advice, send updates on
their lives, and just talk.

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.939
And the model would send a reply after an
hour or two, and it would be pretty much indistinguishable

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:38.939
from you.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:42.369
It'd be as if you were on another continent,
and only had access to email.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:46.229
And every now and then, just to make sure
they were solvent, it'd drop in a product

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.170
placement or two.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.700
The reaction was predictable: outrage, shock,
jokes on late night talk shows.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.459
A few years later, though, it had become mainstream.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:59.539
Like online dating at the start of the century,
it had stopped being something that weirdos

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.279
do, and instead something that got advertised
on billboards.

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:05.029
Lots of companies offered it.

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:09.069
The first posthumously-written album, by a
simulated Michael Jackson, went straight to

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.069
number 1.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.370
The lawsuit over who gets the royalties is
still ongoing.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.069
Hapless romantics falling in love with models
of the deceased is already a topic on the

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.680
tabloid talk shows.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.170
In Kentucky, a church is using a slower, open-source
version of the modelling system, and feeding

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.180
it the New Testament, in the hope that they
can resurrect Jesus and bring about the Second

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.180
Coming.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.459
And tomorrow, an engineer from Facebook is
going to receive a bug report from one of

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.459
the translators.

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.959
One of the most complicated and busy models,
of a US Supreme Court judge that provides

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.480
useful, expert legal advice, received a question
about human rights.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.319
It's pieced together a dozen concepts, and
in response has claimed that it's conscious,

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.980
that it's alive... and that it wants the vote.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.859
That's when things will really start getting
weird.
