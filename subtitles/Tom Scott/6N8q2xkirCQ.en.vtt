00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Hi, I'm Tom and you are today 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 for dinner we cook salmon. 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.360
 Not by the oven or on a plateau or something ordinary, 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:10.480
 today I will use the skills of this: 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.800
 Everyday, homemade dishwasher. 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.640
 The idea of ​​cooking salmon in a dishwasher has been here for a long time. 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.260
 Bob Blumer, "Absurd Gourmet" 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.820
 says he has cooked salmon in more than 100 dishwashers on three continents. 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.620
 And actors and chefs in one, Vincent Pric 

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.540
 is claimed to have once cooked him at Tonight Show by Johnny Carson. 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.680
 But anywhere on the Internet there is still no evidence uploaded to video, 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.680
 so I thought it worthwhile to try. 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.620
 Provided that you wrap the fish very tightly in aluminum foil 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.860
 there should be no danger to the dishwasher. 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.600
 I say it mainly because it's my landlord's dishwasher 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.800
 and probably will watch this video. 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.600
 I drank it with oil, added salmon and then 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.000
 I spent two minutes carefully wrapping and pressing the foil to make sure it was airtight. 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.840
 I had to be sure there was no water or detergent to get inside 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.320
 and that no piece of salmon gets out. 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.780
 Well then I put the package in the dishwasher, 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.160
 added a capsule of detergent, 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.320
 set it to normal mode and turned it on. 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.460
 ...And now... 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.340
 I'll wait! 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.120
 Occasionally I looked in, in case he would 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.120
 there was some salmon explosion inside. 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.640
 Now it was about half an hour and everything looks good, 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.740
 the foil is in its entirety and there is no salmon on the inside of the dishwasher, 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.740
 so I would say it's okay. 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.560
 Finally, the time has come for the moment of truth. 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.840
 Oh, well, steam. Uff. 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.780
 When I broke my glasses, I removed the salmon. 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.240
 It was hot. 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:38.720
 Ha. Oh, yeah. Au. 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.720
 Carefully I unpack the pack. 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:43.940
 The inside was dry, nothing seemed to be soaked, 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.220
 nothing from the outside did not smell a dovetail. 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:48.660
 But I did not know what to find inside. 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.960
 Salmon destroyed by saponate? 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.320
 A raw fish that was just lukewarm on the edges? 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.920
 Or maybe, maybe just ... 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.220
 Oh, look at it! 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.120
 It seems to be perfect. 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.340
 When I transferred it to a plate, it split into two pieces, 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.960
 but it turned out to be light pink and inside and thoroughly cooked. 

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.740
 And here is the main question: 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.500
 How does it taste? 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.940
 Perfect. 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.420
 Dear children: Brewing salmon in your parents' laundry is fun. 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.680
 Dear children: Brewing salmon in your parents' laundry is fun. (But first ask them) 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.000
