00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.860
 After watching the movie, people must think that I am stupid. 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:04.630
 But this is not entirely true, three points are stupid 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:05.620
 Seven points pressure 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.250
 You just said "stupid"? 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.429
 Right, right! Look, I started to attack. 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:10.559
 let us start! 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.150
 Welcome back to "War", I am Tom Scott. 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.200
 I am David Bodycombe. 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.169
 Today is a knockout 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:17.210
 Winners enter the finals 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.610
 Lost people eliminated 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.000
 There is no doubt that this is a revenge game. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.560
 The two sides of the battle are exactly the same as the first round. Steven Bridge is on the Emma Blackery. 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.110
 Last time, Steven won the game with a guessing fist. 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.420
 But that is by observing the opponent’s psychological activities. 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.300
 Basically, it is to see your sensitivity to mental activities. 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.700
 What are we going to play today? 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.410
 Because of the dead bucket mode, the elimination of the loss 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.040
 So what I want to play is the game I invented called "Quiz Buzz". 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.100
 Oh my god, okay. This is a test of general knowledge and mental arithmetic 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.470
 That's right, it's the same as Fizz Buzz* playing at school. 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.420
 But here we don't use Fizz and Buzz instead of numbers. 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.870
 But answer specific questions 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.850
 Wait a minute, you will know. 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.399
 The answer is wrong or not within 5 seconds 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:59.989
 Returning the problem is a lose 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:02.309
 Win three points first to win 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.720
 Ok, players, now start the first round. 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.390
 The condition is to replace the multiple of 5 with the state name of the United States, 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.500
 Replace the multiple of 11 with the name of James Pound’s movie 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.659
 James Pound’s movie, I don’t know. 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:18.360
 Ok? All right 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.810
 Guessing the order 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.420
 Very good, you come first 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.380
 No problem, 1 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.940
 2 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.409

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:31.970

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:33.260

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.099

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.940

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:35.460
 10 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.880
 [噗噗] Wrong, ten wrong. 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.659
 10 is a multiple of 5 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.399
 Emma: Oh no! Tom: It turns out that 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.060
 Emma: I didn't expect Tom: I didn't notice 齁

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.860
 After watching this movie, people will probably say: Oh, she didn’t... 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.420
 But when you are on the stage, it’s just two things. 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.520
 I must look very embarrassed now. 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:52.770
 Oh, the pressure is too big. 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.090
 I only remember 5 and 11 and then there are only odd numbers in my mind. 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.060
 Maybe the first attack is not a good idea. 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.740
 The first attack means that you will encounter odd numbers. 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.659
 Because the problem only occurs in odd numbers (with multiples of it) 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.150
 Otherwise, the same person will answer the question. 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.900
 So the first attack is relatively simple, just remember the odd number. 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.640
 But your opponent has to remember to multiply by 2 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.160
 That's right, but it also means that you will get into the situation one step earlier. 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:14.160
 Yes, I didn’t think she would go wrong there. 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.680
 I didn't notice (the multiple of 3 is replaced by the element on the periodic table) 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.849
 I can't think of an element (the multiple of 3 is replaced by the element on the periodic table) 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.349
 Of course, I can still think of some, but not enough (the multiple of 3 is replaced by the element on the periodic table) 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.569
 1 (multiple of 13 is replaced by the place name of the British Monopoly game) 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:22.669
 2 (multiple of 13 is replaced by the place name of the British Monopoly game) 

00:02:22.669 --> 00:02:23.769
 Boron (B) (multiple of 13 is replaced by the place name of the British Monopoly game) 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.140
 4 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.160
 5 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.420
 Iron (Fe)? I talked about "boron" from the beginning. 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.820
 7 

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.210

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.599
铍(Be) 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.140
 This is very simple 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.489
呃...10 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.170
 11 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.240
 12 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.220
 [噗噗] Wrong! Wrong answer! 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.700
 Multiples of 3! 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.260
 Steven: Hey! Damn it! Emma: Water! 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.830
 I like the expression of his face, "Hey?" 

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:51.280
 You said a bunch of things I have never heard of! 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.440
 Let’s pick it up briefly, then your opponent can’t use it. 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.500
 You should pick something like oxygen (O) or 氦 (He). 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.120
 I intended to use it later, but... 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.569
 That's right, but I don't know why my brain only wants to get metal. 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:01.580
 I think your problem is not that. 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.140
 Factorization is! 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.349
 They are still full of scary 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.360
 Their scary efforts are still very powerful. 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.319
 I am even thinking about something like a planet, such as a meditation element? 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.239
 Is that on the periodic table? ..... Oh, forget it. 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:16.230
 I still want to mention that Pluto is not a planet. 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.170
 In our hearts it has always been a planet 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.120
 We know that it is a planet that is not big enough to be... (planet) 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.170
 Isn't the puppy a dog? You are really 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.060
 What is it, it is obviously different, not just a small dog. 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.629
 Here to remind you that players can't see the information on the screen. 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.389
 They can only rely on their own memories

 That's right! She almost said Brazil, although not right. 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:03.940
 But we will be accommodating 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.100

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.930

 Oh, good to add! 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.960
 Currently Emma 2 is better than Steven 1, so I came to the deciding game. 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.330

 [噗噗] Wrong! 19 is a prime number! 

00:05:02.759 --> 00:05:04.029
 Oh no! 

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:05.260
 Prime numbers are always safe 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.580
 I have a lot of research on politicians. I should have a good answer in the "Quality Minister ***". 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.139
 I seem to be falling behind. 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:12.830
 It’s 2 to 2, and both sides are now entering the deciding game. 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:15.569
 The next winner will enter the finals. 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:19.389
 Tom: The loser will be eliminated. David: It’s a drop. 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:23.849

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.460
 15 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:52.620
 [Puff] Wrong! The game is over! 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:53.419
 water! 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.560
 Multiple of three! water! 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:05:57.820
 Really scared me. 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:01.960
 This is the most complicated and troublesome Fizz Buzz I have ever played in my life. 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:02.800
 It’s really stressful. 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.160
 Amazing 

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.320
 I entered the finals! Wow! 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:11.439
 That's it. The next unbeaten Hannah Nicklin is on Emma Blackery. 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:14.809
 (Emma) Lost the first game after the fire was reborn and killed like a champion 

00:06:14.809 --> 00:06:16.479
 What are you playing next time? 

00:06:16.479 --> 00:06:18.979
 A game that tests the brain, its name: order and chaos 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:19.789
 See you in the next episode 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.960
