00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.260
 Welcome back to "war" 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:07.069
 Today's game is a magician's game designer, or more accurately 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:09.830
 It’s the magician’s last person who doesn’t like it very much. 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.019
 I am Tom Scott. 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.219
 I am David Bodycombe. 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:14.349
 By Steven Bridges on Hannah Nicklin 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.500
 What they are going to play today is the "weighted battle" 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.220
 Both hands will have numbers 1 to 11 (red &amp; blue) 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.270
 There is also a set of 1 to 11 cards (yellow) on the table. 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.090
 The cards on the counter are turned up one at a time. 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.660
 The numbers on the board represent the scores. 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.430
 And they want to bid with their hands as chips. 

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.450
 The player with the big card can get the score on the yellow card. 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.780
 Chips are void 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.220
 The key is to observe the opponent's reaction and hand management. 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.710
 Yes, and you can't predict too much 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.120
 Because we took out one of the yellow cards in advance. 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.140
 So even if you can remember all the cards that have appeared, it will not help. 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.400
 Because your information is not complete 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.980
 Not exactly at all. 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.300
 Ok, let's wait and see! 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.610
 let us start 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.280
 Ok, it is 9. A good 9 ah 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:56.250
 In the opening, the score is full. 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.280
 He wants to start with strong 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.470
 As a magician and a psychologist, this is exactly what he is good at. 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.980
 I'm ready. My number is still big. 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:04.750
 Because it is 9 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.140
 You really...you guys... 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.479
 So if I were you, I would rather give up a 2 and also... 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.490
 Do you think I might believe your ghost? 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.450
 Ok, actually my number is quite small. 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.640
 Someone has done mathematical analysis on this game. 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.000
 They found that the best way to play is to use 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.990
 The same number of chips to bid 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.560
 But your opponent will definitely be after a few times 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:24.530
 Take note of your behavior and use 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.930
 Let’s bid for a card bigger than you. 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.950
 Obviously this method is countermeasures, but 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.350
 That's just the result of the analysis. 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:30.030
 Steven: Are you satisfied? Hannah: That's right. 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.049
 3, 2, 1... 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:32.460
 Wow 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.140
 What he just said is true. 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.840
 Yes 3, can't miss it. 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.670
 If you have a card, you have to find a way to do it. 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.140
 The more you lose, the better. 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.150
 Ok, I think I will make this out. 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.290
 Because if you lose a big card result but lose, then 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.640
 Your situation is dangerous. 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.640
 Well, some people will come out from the small card at the beginning. 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.070
 So they know what to do next. 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.520
 That's right, this game Hannah is beautiful, that's right. 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.390
 5! Is a good number 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.000
 This is the second number he said is "good". 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.259
 Hannah: Well, a 5 ah Steven: I am so entangled. 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.020
 Steven: I decided Hannah: Ok. 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.390
 Flop 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.281
 six 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.560
 He has always been one more than the number on the counter. It is not bad. 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.219
 But then he will soon have no big names. 

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:19.150
 This is the second time you have played a card more than the number on the table. 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.040
 That's right, this is called mode! 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.940
 She noticed 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:27.659
 Do you think he will be 7 this time? 

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:28.879
 3, 2, 1! 

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:30.139
 Tom: No Hannah: Interesting! 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.540
 He didn't make 7 and she came out 8 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.519
 She thought he would come out 7 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:36.260
 She (Hannah) hooked up 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.849
 He turned the crisis that the scheme was seen into a turning point! 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:41.999
 He is very good at psychological control. 

00:02:41.999 --> 00:02:43.499
 The smaller the card, the better, right? 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.059
 Don't waste big cards on District 2 

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.859
 He said yes... 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:48.499
 I really want to swear you a dirty now! 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:54.139
 This is for you, please use it slowly. 

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:55.829
 Actually! Was put together 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:58.639
 Although we gave two players 11 cards 

00:02:58.639 --> 00:03:01.260
 But because there are only 10 yellow cards, so 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.260
 There is a card that will not be used at all. 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.019
 So there is actually no reason for 1 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:05.889
 Absolutely not 

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.269
 There is now 11 on the table! 

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:09.370
 Oh! She will definitely get 11 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.109
 What she has been waiting for is this time 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:13.109
 I should try my best to win this. 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:15.859
 If you have already knocked out a lot of big names then 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.790
 If you feel that your success is weak, here you can 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.719
 Smaller 

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:21.730
 If we both out 11 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.309
 Will it become a situation where no one wins? 

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:24.969
 That's right, then we skip this game 

00:03:24.969 --> 00:03:26.290
 But your 10 has been destroyed, I have not 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.489
 So I will definitely win 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.040
 Hey, then go back to 11 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.449
 Don't tell your tactics! 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.290
 So in this case, the scores of both groups belong to me. 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:34.480
 do not talk! 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.400
 Oh, really? Really? 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.549
 Emma is right. She said too much! 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.859
 Hannah is right. She will definitely win this game. 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.620
 But her strategy has leaked, so 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.269
 Yes, we are fine. 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.109
 Ok, you better can only do this. 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.469
 I didn’t tell you when I knew it. 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:54.510
 I already knew it! 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.659
 Who is going to lie, seeing that he just had a look of doubt, he knew that he didn’t notice 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.669
 Steven: You won! Hannah: Yes, I know. 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:01.400
 I think that something happened just now. 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.540
 Hannah can win the previous game at a smaller price. 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.459
 It’s now a flat hand. 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.129
 Oh, so now it’s 20 to 20 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:14.419
 This gap is small. 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:17.840
 In theory, this game is likely to play to the tie, 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.500
 But it depends on which number was removed. 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.940
 Does he want to play with her? 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:24.040
 He can not do this! 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:25.400
 He knows exactly what he is doing. 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.760
 To be honest, I am actually immune to magic. 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.200
 Damn, my spell has failed! 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.890
 Okay 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.740
 Congratulations 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.270
 This game is beautiful. Absolutely correct 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.320
 Those big names are wasted, and the return on investment is infinitely close to zero. 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.550
 But their 1 is destroyed, so say... 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.980
 His big name was wasted in this game! 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:50.540
 Steven: Is this the last one? Hannah: Uh huh 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:53.060
 Ah, because we only have... 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.300
 Damn, I didn't think about it at all, that? 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.730
 After the result is a tie! 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:58.760
 That's right, both are 28 points! 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.900
 They are flat! 

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.160
 This is so interesting! What is your last card? 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:03.700
 Hannah: 呃6 Steven: I am 9 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.080
 I just had a place wrong because 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.190
 I forgot that the yellow card is one less. 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.530
 I want to say that this is going to be left to the end. 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:08.970
 It seems that we have to enter the playoffs! 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:14.040
 The version of this game with five cards 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.970
 Random from 1 to 7 

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:18.910
 See who will win in the end 

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:26.920
 Uh, not bad. 

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.100
 He wasted a card, but the number is not big. 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.740
 Ok 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:32.420
 This game has a gameplay that should be full of fun. 

00:05:32.420 --> 00:05:35.790
 I don't want to tell you how to play because you... 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.210
 In case you learn from me again. Yes, I guess this will happen. 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.260
 It seems that she learned this time! 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.700
 Oh, flat, so we have to go straight over 5 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.470
 In the next game, you can get 2 and 5 in the win. 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:47.560
 This is also full of fun 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.520
 I am now dominant. 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:50.590
 Their 5 have been used up. 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:52.490
 And their hands are only 1 to 5 

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.100
 Oh, ah. 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:58.920
 Does he have an advantage? I can't see it. 

00:05:58.920 --> 00:06:02.300
 He scored 7 points with 5 and 4 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.340
 There may be 7 in the remaining yellow card, so... 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.750
 That's right, but he has already knocked out the biggest two in his hand, isn't he? 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.060
 Yes, I think that is not a smart move. 

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.650
 It’s useful if there are no 7 in the remaining yellow cards. 

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.060
 But this is very risky 

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:20.720
 Ah... good one 2 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:21.480
 ended! 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:23.760
 Do you have more than 3? 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:24.700
 Ok, she won! 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:27.280
 She only won two cards and won because there is a 7 in it. 

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.420
 Steven: Oh no! David: That's right, 11 to 10 she won! 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.660
 Win me a point, do it well! Lost, defeated 

00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:35.180
 I haven’t responded yet. 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.290
 That's it, Hannah went straight to the finals. 

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:39.400
 But there is still a knockout before this. 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.590
 Steven wants to play against Emma in the play-off 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:43.840
 Winners participate in the finals. What are they going to play? 

00:06:43.840 --> 00:06:46.400
 The game I invented, Quiz Buzz 

00:06:48.730 --> 00:06:50.580
 So it is a test of basic common sense and... 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:51.510
 Brain flexibility 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:54.260
 I believe that Katie must be very annoyed that she can't play this game. 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:55.210
 See you next time. 

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.820
