00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.670
 Looks tempting, but you do not want to swim inside. 

00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:04.980
 It's dark, lonely water. 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.400
 It looks toxic blue, which is. It's lazy, it has a pH above 11, it would be like swimming 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.599
 in diluted bleach. It is not enough to cause injury on the spot, but enough that over time 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.690
 it exfoliates skin and eyes. Suffice to challenge the problems day-two later. 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:21.970
 The feeling would be as if you were soaking with soap and you did not wash it, but let it dry. 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.890
 That lumpiness comes from limestone. This is an old limestone quarry that emits crystals 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.630
 calcium in water. Can not be emptied, where would you drop the water? That would only 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.769
 harms local water. Then the rain would fill the lagoon again and become toxic. 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:36.309
 Only a fool would ignore this, 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.979
 but one is born every minute. 

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:43.510
 For a while, this was not Blue Lagoon, this was Black Lagoon. That black color is not 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.519
 it was dangerous, it caused the color that the local council put in. It was harmless. But that blue: 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:52.819
 it calls for swimming. The black lagoon, with the dye, was equally toxic, equally damaging, 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:56.639
 equally likely to cause the disease. It was equally likely to give you a nasty fungus 

00:00:56.639 --> 00:01:01.329
 infection a few days later because you blew a part of your body accidentally, but blue water: 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.100
 Reminds of the tropical sea, the sun, the holidays. Black water? 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.310
 Oh, no, we do not want to swim in that. 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.549
 The coloring of this water in black was a genius idea. It has done more than ever could be a sign 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.130
 warning. And that meant that many people did not become sick of swimming. 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.960
 But 2015 is: Blue Lagoon is blue again, and I guarantee that this summer is someone 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.320
 bleed. 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.280
