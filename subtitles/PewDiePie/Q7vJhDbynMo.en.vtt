 (Girl): I knew someone, I went out with him once, to do things ... 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.820
 And I did him **** by hand, and barely caught **** and did it completely on my stomach 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.300
 Well, my name has already spoken to me and let's not hide this thing. Because it makes it worse, okay? Let's be frank here 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.240

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.320
 (Felix mimics the girl): I was once with a boy grabbed my stomach 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.040
 Then he did it entirely to me 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.040

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.940
 But I think, because in the character I know, it is somewhat quiet I would like to be 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.940
 Milfette's character, because he is quite skinny and 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.980

 Sometimes social interaction, be like "wow" what happened here? 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.160

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.700

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.080

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.960
 - Clown? * The cop represents that he is surprised * 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.480
 (Child): Do you have a weapon? 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:25.440
 - Yeah 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.480

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.080
 Is the police officer doing a live broadcast of this hell look like a bad idea 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.120
 Did he shoot the moment of his release on the clown or not? I want to know 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.080
 * Someone stole the camera * 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:49.520
 Oooo 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:04:01.200
 * The voice of the steps ran the harami * 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.200
 Damn 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.020
 I mean, this was supposed to happen later 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:16.220
 Did he get his subscribers? If someone had actually stolen my computer, it would have gotten my channel, too. It 's coming with it. It' s like an extra package 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:23.060
 Peron ask the women behind you if they want to eat their back 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:35.720
 - They want you to ask the misery behind you if they want to eat their asses = Hello ?? They are British ??? !!

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.640
 They seem to have planned for this 

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.420
 - Too shameful my friend = very painful 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.460
 Oh, oh, ah, come on. They 've planned it all. I' m glad the girl 's gone. They' ll have a good time with older women. 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:34.000

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:38.520

 You are using your fault and exercises 

00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:29.400
 Hell, is this a Russian mother? 

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:38.740
 This is not what you talk about. I was here first. Let me finish my exercise. Then you can come. I do not understand 

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:42.560

 I mean she was really skinny so I understand her meaning 

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.920
 I do not even drink a full bottle, but I feel stupid and drunk 

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.920
 There are men standing there 

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.000
 Oh, oh God, what will happen? 

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.200

00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.280
 * Felix is ​​provocative and hears strange sounds * 

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.600
 Oh my god, I have seen these too 

00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.420
 Are they from Korea? 

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.120
 Or Japan? 

00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:54.800
 * The drunkard * 

00:09:57.520 --> 00:09:59.120

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.120
 Are you fine? 

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.120
 Why take a lot of time to show the reaction! 

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:15.540
 It 's like ... that his face is flabbergasted when he sees what' s happening 

00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:21.720
 It was .. Is I pretend that this is my girlfriend or not? 

00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.640
 Yeah ? 

00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:30.160
 -Hai Zhou .. We have a donation to be preferred.

 who is he ? To? Indomie (Maalish Joan) 

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:48.160
 It seems very different when you reap money from the street instead of paying you people 

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.600
 online. It is really a difference, because you do not take money in the street because you are like a beggar 

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:55.760
 You have donated me! 

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.360
 It has disappeared! 

00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:06.960
 Well this was the episode this week of "Swede" You're laughing you're losing 

00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.160
 Honorable Family Edition 

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.420
 Do you know how to know that it is a respectable family? Because this video is dreaded by advertisements 

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.560
 If there are no ads to sample on this video you will become very angry 

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:26.900
 Put Lake to laugh if you lose or tell me in the comets if I laugh or lose .. 

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:30.280
 And remember to have a happy day ..
