00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:05.900
TOM: I'm kind of expecting it to be this enormous
bit of equipment that's sitting round here somewhere.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:09.259
JACQUES: No, no, you're almost there. It's
just in... this cupboard.

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:10.389
TOM: This cupboard!

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:16.630
JACQUES: So here is... the quantum computer.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.400
TOM: That little chip there?

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.880
JACQUES: In fact, what it really is, is just
this -- you see the very thin black strip

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.480
in the middle. That's actually the chip.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.170
Most classical computers store information
on big macroscopic things. And what we do

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.940
at the Centre for Quantum Photonics, and what
other people are doing around the world, is

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.789
try to store that information on single particles.
Or single atoms. In our case, we're going

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:45.269
to do it with photons, particles of light.
And then you start inheriting the beautiful

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:46.620
rules of quantum physics.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.089
TOM: So this is double-slit experiment, this
is something that is a particle and a wave

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.050
at the same time.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.819
JACQUES: And if you imagine these -- your
two slits, and we say, well, a photon going

00:00:55.819 --> 00:01:01.479
through the top slit is a 0, and a photon
going through the bottom slit is a 1, now

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.150
when we run this experiment we've got the
idea that we've got both a 0 and a 1 at the same time.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.330
TOM: So by cleverly cancelling out those waves,
adding them, you can kind of design an algorithm?

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:18.050
JACQUES: ...yeah. This is where it gets a
bit tricker. Back in the olden days, when

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.730
you wanted to build a quantum computer, you
needed big things like this. The problem with

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.000
this is that it gets a bit hot, and we maybe
knock something, and it all misaligns. What

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.030
we do in Bristol is we've been designing and
fabricating what we call waveguides. Now waveguides

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.470
are basically just bits of fibre-optic on
chip, on a bit of glass.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:34.960
TOM: Okay.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.690
JACQUES: So we can actually manipulate the
photons moving through a bit of silicon.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.740
TOM: And so by changing how the waveguides
act, you can change the photons --

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.530
the way the photons pass through the system.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.850
JACQUES: Exactly.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.580
TOM: And that's your programming? That's algorithm
design...

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.820
JACQUES: That's our programming. So we're
going to get our bit of glass, and we're going

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.870
to put a metal piece of conductor on top.
And when we apply a voltage, it's going to

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.260
heat the thing up -- it's a heater...

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.050
TOM: Which changes how the waveguide acts...

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.210
JACQUES: Yeah! It changes the refractive index.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.610
TOM: Which slows the light down.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.120
JACQUES: Precisely.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:07.060
TOM: Just a tiny amount but enough to change
the interference pattern later on, because

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.270
we're dealing with the speed of light, the
wavelengths involved are tiny tiny tiny...

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.690
JACQUES: Yes, exactly.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.170
TOM: So a tiny bit of heating in the waveguide
changes the interference pattern, changes

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:16.450
the quantum computer, that's your programming.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.950
JACQUES: You got it. You got it!

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.620
TOM: There is a guy -- the person from the
university who's just behind the camera, who

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.569
you can't see in the dark there, is just going
"yes! he got it!"

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.800
JACQUES: It's online now. So what you can
do is, you can go and play around with a simulation

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.560
of it, a model, and if you come up with an
idea you can then ask to actually use it.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.970
TOM: To use that?

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.300
JACQUES: And to put photons into it and to
heat it up in real life. So it's there, for

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.840
people to use, it's called Quantum in the
Cloud.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.550
That's what we're getting excited about.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.190
TOM: Jacques Carolan is from the Centre for
Quantum Photonics at the University of Bristol.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:52.209
Jacques, thank you very much.

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:53.670
JACQUES: Thank you very much, Tom.
