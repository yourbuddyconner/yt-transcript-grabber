00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.800

 Here in the presidency 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.680
 It's like proudly bragging and shit is a stream of crumbs typical that can not help themselves any chance as they get to show their kisses bottoms 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.200
 They will take 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.480

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.040

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.780

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.980
 Maybe guitar as you can see here guitar's under everyone's bed 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.660
 The guitar is probably yes

 Maybe guitar. I do not need to check or anything 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.339
 It's not like what I see in the video. I just move it 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.580
 You may just move this game play over here so you can see it a little better 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.440
 Element Water - It 's funny or not reading the title I feel 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.450
 OMG Stop Stop Got the Butterfly I've got a Butterfly Knife 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:59.450

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:01.450
 My God 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.450

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.060
 Damn 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.020
 Because this always happens 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.640
 Because they continue to act by themselves. His degree of enthusiasm may be imaginary 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:37.749
 Knife I can understand something if you are overly confident and such was the wind and 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:41.979
 You are chaotic and enthusiastic and you curse yourself 

00:05:42.559 --> 00:05:46.449
 Would not be great if you did not get a butterfly knife 

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:48.440
 O Allah 

00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.080
 5 screens 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.880
 You do not play 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.960
 get down 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:07.260
 Stop yelling! Do you think he thinks he is silent there 

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.260
 I will withdraw all those 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.260
 Turn this off and go back to bed 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.720
 Mom 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.720
 I've been sleeping all day 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:22.720
 I do not care about going back to bed 

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.920
 This is very embarrassing 

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.920
 And yes I shout deliberately 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.200
 So all can be heard 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.680
 My mother is not able to hear now .. probably 

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:40.120
 I want to see him realize he forgot the microphone 

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:45.159
 Was Micfrone busy all the time? 

00:06:46.549 --> 00:06:49.328
 That made the end worth it all right oh 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:53.588
 God bless 

00:06:53.589 --> 00:06:57.518
 I have seen this because it is a wonderful Japanese person 

00:06:58.009 --> 00:07:05.889
 I'm playing fire at home 

00:07:08.749 --> 00:07:10.749
 Oww 

00:07:11.269 --> 00:07:14.289
 We do not know Maldi tends to burn 

00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:20.679
 As you can see there is no lack of flammability here at the back 

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:25.169
 No 

00:07:30.349 --> 00:07:33.069
 Look behind you please see behind you 

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:36.729
 O God, not Ooh 

00:07:37.249 --> 00:07:44.199
 Take off the shirt, turn off the fire, my God 

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:52.748
 Use the pillow O my God 

00:07:53.719 --> 00:07:56.559
 More flammability 

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.870
 This painful 

00:08:01.999 --> 00:08:09.639
 There must be an instructional video that does not do Oh my God that it only runs away Well is this this ohh? 

00:08:15.139 --> 00:08:17.139
 O Allah 

00:08:17.270 --> 00:08:20.109
 I have read well after this 

00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:28.329
 It was fine not hurt anyone which is important and take this as a lesson from 

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.560
 Mada should not do 

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:38.970
 Is this his mother? 

00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.329
 Hilda I'm covering a broadcast 

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:15.569
 She has got it going on this is not the most bikini boys for Hitler that is not. No, my bikini 

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:21.269

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.779
 Yes, you've just started 

00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:33.280
 That's true 

00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:35.280
 Okay 

00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.320
 What time in America ah 

00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:47.990
 I do not know I've lost the track at all times since I went to China? 

00:09:54.210 --> 00:09:58.909
 Oh my God this is the most strange interaction 

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.370
 What happens with the Aoh check? 

00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.040
 There is a word I am 

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:18.799
 I have seen a lot of times because it is called half of G searched in the interpreter 

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:24.289
 Google but there is no such result as what it means 

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:29.750
 But I'd lie if you're looking at that Google gets a lot of traffic 

00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:36.229
 But I think this is the guess that the terms they use are 

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:38.640
 Basis 

00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:41.749
 I'm a gay who is wrong 

00:10:43.950 --> 00:10:45.930
 Like me 

00:10:45.930 --> 00:10:49.849
 Or gay yes I am good and I am actually not good 

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.140

 I will finish this dream thanks for watching 

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:27.350
 Such as famine and the fountain
