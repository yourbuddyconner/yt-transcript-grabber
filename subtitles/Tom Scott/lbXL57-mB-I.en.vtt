00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.900
Scotland is rising...

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.900
and England is sinking.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:04.980
And I'm not speaking metaphorically,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.180
I am speaking literally

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.940
Which is why I'm here at the Thames Barrier

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.940
This gorgeous thing behind me is one

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.540
of the largest moblie flood barriers in the world

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.260
And it's what stops the Docklands over there behind me

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.240
From being completely inundated when there's a storm surge or a spring tide

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:21.660
And here's the thing,

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.340
when I say Scotland is rising, I don't mean it metaphorically,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:26.980
I'm not talking about the referendum, I'm talking literally

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.120
Scotland is rising up by about 10cm every century

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.020
And down here, in the south of England

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.020
the area that the Thames Barrier is protecting

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.400
well that's dropping by about 5cm every century

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.200
It's not much

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.100
particuarly compared to the sea level rises

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.040
that the Thames Barrier is going to protect us against in the next few decades

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.420
But it's still there

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.140
It's a process called 'glacial isostatic adjustment'

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.140
The idea that 20,000 years ago

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.140
Scotland was covered in glaciers

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.580
and England wasn't

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.040
I mean, it wasn't that precise

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:57.700
It's not like they stopped at
what would be Hadrian's Wall

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.520
but that was roughly the area

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.080
That pressure from the ice squeezed the mantle out of the way

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.480
and even now, 20 millennia later

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.960
it's still flowing slowly backwards

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.600
moving Scotland upwards and us,
slowly, down into the sea

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.040
Scotland is slowly gaining height, England is steadily losing it

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.480
and to be honest, the United Kingdom might be about to lose a heck of a lot more

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.360
depending on how the referendum turns out in a couple of days time

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.360
One more thing before I go

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.080
regular subscribers may know i sometimes try out different formats here

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.080
and well, I've got a new one for you

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.880
starting this Wednesday, 4 episodes of Crush Test

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.240
a gadget reveiw show where if you like it you get to keep it

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.680
and if you don't you get to violently destroy it

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.480
as well as that, the Technical Difficulties team are getting together

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:43.480
for new episodes of citation needed

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.960
we're recording this weekend and we should have those for you pretty soon

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.960
and if neither of those are your thing, don't worry

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.120
there are plenty of things you might not know still to come

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.440
