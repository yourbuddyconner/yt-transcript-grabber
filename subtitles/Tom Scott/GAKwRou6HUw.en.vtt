00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:05.190
 I am at the castle of Urquhart, near Loch Ness, in the mountains of Scotland. This whole area makes 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.120
 part of the Great Glen fault - running from the northeast to the southwest, from the North Sea 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.170
 through Inverness, through Scotland in an almost straight line, then forms Loch Ness, and then goes 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.240
 all the way through the Irish Sea and Ireland. It is a transform fracture, two parts of the 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.970
 earth sliding alongside each other. 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.109
 This is the middle of the Highlands, the mountains that can be found throughout Scotland and all the way 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.570
 to Norway: the same mountains that were formed when continents nearly 400 million years 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.600
 suffered. This was before Pangea, the enormous supercontinent, all the land on earth at one 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.739
 place - that would only be formed a hundred million years later, and this would be the Central 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.489
 Pangea Mountains. The time scale we are talking about is incomprehensible to people. 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.460
 But Pangea eventually split up. Land continued to move, at about the same speed as with which you fingernails 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.739
 to grow. And during this unimaginably long time this mountain was split. Not only by 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.650
 the North Sea, between here and Scandinavia, but also through the Atlantic Ocean, which was slowly forming. 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.820
 Just look at Newfoundland, in the northeast of Canada: you will see the same properties, 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.100
 the same line from the northeast to the southwest as with the Great Glen fracture. Canada and Scotland 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.770
 are separated by an ocean and still move slowly apart, but once they were connected. 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.110
 The fossils and geology fit. These mountains, these beautiful mist-covered Scottish mountains 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.660
 are also the Appalachians, the mountain range that runs through the south of the US. 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.420
 There has been a lot of erosion and uplift since then, 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.600
 that happened over a period of about half a billion years, but once they were one and the same. 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.880
 The Scottisch Highlands and the Appalachians are the same mountain range, 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.340
 literally an ocean away from each other.
