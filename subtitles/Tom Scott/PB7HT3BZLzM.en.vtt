00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.760
 I am in Weldon Spring, near St Louis, Missouri, USA 

00:00:02.769 --> 00:00:04.780
 and in the 50s and 60s, 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.380
 this strange, gray, bare hill was not here: 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.700
 instead there was a uranium processing plant 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.950
 And the conditions for the workers of that time were shocking compared to today's standards. 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:16.029
 It was not as bad as the 40s' 

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:21.690
 You can find reports from then about workers who scooped uranium ore by hand, 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.080
 but there are stories of spilled radioactive powder, 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.840
 overflowing waste wells, 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.019
 and strange-looking frogs. 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.169
 And I do not make that up. 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.000
 When the factory was still open, he was known as "De Schone". 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.430
 And, yes, it was not. 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.320
 The factory closed in 1966, 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.329
 as the most polluted place in the region: 

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.670
 PCBs, mercury, asbestos and radioactive waste. 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.980
 In the 1980s, the Environmental Protection Agency declared Weldon Spring 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.540
 a Superfund Site, 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:54.080
 which meant that it would finally be cleaned up. 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:59.430
 And this is the result: a rubbish dump for nuclear waste of seven stories high, 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.469
 the permanent landfill 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.479
 consisting of more than one million cubic meters of toxic waste, 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:08.850
 what, hopefully, the local residents will protect for the next thousand years, approximately. 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.259
 And that would have been almost the entire video. 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.509
 If you search this place online, most items do not go beyond this. 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:15.509
 But. 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.450
 Then I did a little more research. 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.490
 And I learned from the existence of Coldwater Creek, a few miles away, 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.490
 where radioactive waste from the Manhattan Project, 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.979
 the project that made the first nuclear bombs, 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.270
 that waste was just dumped there in the 40s, 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:29.340
 with permission from the government. 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.429
 In the end, that waste, decades later, flooded the backyards of people after a flood. 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:36.139
 That was in 2015. 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.979
 Then there is the West Lake Landfill, on the other side of St Louis, 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.609
 where an underground waste fire is raging, 

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:46.420
 very close to another storage facility for radioactive waste, for almost seven years. 

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:49.560
 The risk is apparently small. 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.319
 No one will be about to find a glowing barrel in his backyard. 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.929
 But the dangers of radiation are invisible and frightening: 

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:59.430
 residents are concerned about groups of cancer diagnoses, 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.429
 about child mortality due to contaminated groundwater. 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:06.569
 There are groundwater sources just a mile away. 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:08.709
 The state department of health did research 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.460
 and their results did not reassure anyone. 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:14.700
 There are so many factors that play a role 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.420
 that the facts are confusing and unknown somewhere. 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.300
 And people are afraid. 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.340
 This place is a legacy from a period in which the people in charge, 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.420
 did not know about, or did not care about the risks of radioactive pollution. 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.349
 But this is not a monument to the solution of their mistakes: 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:36.091
 it is a reminder that we are still recovering them, 

00:02:36.091 --> 00:02:40.629
 and that we will have to do that for the next centuries or millennia.
