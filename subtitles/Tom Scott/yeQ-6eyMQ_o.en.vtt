00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.649
 I am in the British Museum, after closing, when all the visitors have gone, 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.040
 and here is the Rosetta Stone. 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:10.830
 It was the key to understanding Egyptian hieroglyphics, and it is one of the most precious treasures and 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.759
 valuable from the British Museum. 

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:18.260
 In fact, this is not the authentic Rosetta Stone - they are locked in a closet incredibly 

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.750
 protected on the other side of the main yard; This is the reply that let people touch. 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.820
 And so many people have to do a new replication, by hand, each pair 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.080
 of years. Anyway. 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.669
 Until Rose Rosetta was discovered, and was quickly "acquired" by the Napoleon campaign 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.790
 In Egypt, no one in modern times had any idea of ​​how Egyptian writing worked. The idea 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.620
 Most popular it was that it was purely ideographic, where each drawing represented a concept. 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.160
 Modern linguists know that this is unlikely, but this is more obvious in perspective: without 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.270
 no context or existing translations, there was no way to decipher any hieroglyphic, 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.239
 nowhere 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.350
 But after all: the Rosetta Stone. Originally part of a temple that probably fell when 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.460
 a Roman emperor closed all non-Christian temples, and then probably used as a 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.129
 construction material. He was buried for centuries, until French soldiers found her and one 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.470
 of them realized what could be their importance. The same text, in three languages: 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.630
 hieroglyphics, demotic, and most importantly, classical Greek, 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.210
 that had never been forgotten. 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.939
 But the translation was not easy. Academics took twenty years to find out, because the stone 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.630
 is full of jargon The concepts that are there are not simple. And Egyptian hieroglyphics are complicated: 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.460
 the same symbol can be used phonetically, to represent a sound; and to represent one 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.420
 abstract concept; and to literally represent what he has drawn; all depending on the context. 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.450
 And yes, it's a bit like sending messages with emoticons, if you think about it. 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.060
 The great track that helped translate is here: cartridges, these circles with lines. 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.380
 They are honorary brands that are placed next to the names of the kings. So scholars know this: 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.770
 There are names in other languages ​​here that we can read. These names also appeared in the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.670
 hieroglyphs Wait, there was also the theory that the cartridges represented names. So that 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.659
 if we stick these letters with ... in short, I am simplifying, very much; It was incredibly amazing 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:02.259
 difficult, and to make it more frustrating, the translations are not exact: there are differences between 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.990
 each of the three texts. But once a bit was deciphered, there was an entrance, and 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.290
 With decades of effort, we began to be able to translate hieroglyphics. 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:16.770
 The question that few people are making, however, is: what does Rosetta Stone say? What 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:22.640
 Is there written here? What mysteries of the life of ancient Egypt are revealed? It goes from a royal cult 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.530
 You get certain favors, including tax exemption. It is, essentially, tax paperwork 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:29.610
 of Ancient Egypt. 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.810
 The British Museum is testing four new series on YouTube, and the one you like the most 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:35.700
 will come true 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.670
 So visit your channel! And many thanks to them to let me in 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.800
 to this incredible place outside hours of visit.
