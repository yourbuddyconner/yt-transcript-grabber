00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
 Bababa 

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.940
 It's time for me to praise you little kids, do not worry. 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:06.020
 This TV got the new LG Wallpaper. 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.440
 It's seriously the coolest TV I have ever had. 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.460
 I want to show you guys. 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:19.440
 As you can see, perfect pictures, perfect quality. It's like - looking like a window. It really feels like it. 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.520
 So, as you can see, when the color becomes black, it's already black. It is, OLED technology, that's right, look for this on Google 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.960
 very nice 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:36.820
 You do not get that in a lot of TVs, too, in a very kind way, look how thin it is. It's like having an image already on your wallet, like I have not seen anything like it. I like relapse 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.900
 very nice 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:39.500
 Like looking at it, how is it so real? 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.240
 So, all the devices are in the speakers, which have a sound like an amazing theater as well. 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.940
 So it has the perfect video and audio feature with Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos. 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.780
 So it really looks like a movie theater. 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.180
 Wait, I want to show you this look at it. Ohaha 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.220
 It's a window, everyone! You do not need windows anymore. Just get LG TV Wallpapers. 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.840
 I do not know how to describe it perfectly, but it does not look like anything I've seen. 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:17.120
 Thank you LG for sponsoring this video. If you want to check out one too, the link is in the description. Let's go back to the video. (Oh and finally) 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.260
 You guys, this is very dangerous 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.820
 Mimis is about to get banned 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.300
 In the European Union 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.040
 This may be the last episode of 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.000
 Lowe 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.440
 We have ever done 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.320
 And I will taste it 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.320
 For another very small part of Mimi 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.840
 Welcome to the final episode 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:39.840
 From Lowy 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.980
 I know. I know it is difficult 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.840
 I know it's hard, but we have to go beyond that 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.920
 Honestly, I, kind of, like 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.480
 I know everyone says 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.480
 "Oh, no, let's not ban the mimes." 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.460
 50% of me say yes 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.980
 There is a small part of me that thinks unfairly "You know what 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.000
 Just let them die 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.760
 Just let me die 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.240
 You look at the mimes like Boar Etruscan 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.940
 500-600 BC 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.840
 And just have to think of yourself (oh really I thought that someone would do it for me) 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.400
 Just let her die. Let - just burn them all 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.620
 Let's just burn them all 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.400
 But anyway, let's begin by reviewing the memes 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.940
 If you understand this, you'll go to hell 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.880
 Curse 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.340
 damn it. 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:45.020
 When I studied 4 years of journalism, I ended up typing BuzzFeed 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.520
 Yeah 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.000
 Who does not like to have $ 25,000 in debt and taking a career path can not really adapt much more? 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:56.800
 What do you call the sad strawberries? 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.060
 Blueberry 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.860
 Jesus' right. Damn, man. 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.480
 Get out of here with your punk retarded 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.280
 Listen here, you are a huge bag of shit 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:14.400
 You are wild 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.780
 I'm trying to kill this Mim 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:25.740
 does not work 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:27.940
 It's too strong 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.940
 World War III will be Battle of Royale 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.820
 It is logical 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.820
 But will Trump be at the Royal Battle? 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:38.320
 Will Patel's battle be politically owned? 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.060
 Progressive Thinking Battle Royale? 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.260
 Hmm? 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.240
 Sharing the memes that I have done with friends in the EU that I do not fall into trouble 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:54.000
 Would not it be great if Mimat became just an illegal business underground? 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.760
 I mean, I think it is 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.180
 That is the goal 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.480
 You know what, we live in the darkest and most terrible times 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.160
 Vote if you want Gloria Borger and Poppy Harlow to host Pew News together 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.160
 Now you're just greedy, okay? 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.160
 Poppy never drowns 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.400
 8K = All hell can be seen on his face 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.640
 Wonderful. I look exactly like my father 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.160
 He's creepy 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.640
 4K = grief can be seen away from expression 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.000
 720p = Looks good 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.500
 360p = happier for mother's nest * cker 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.580
 We need to reduce quality, okay? 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.960
 You can see my depression 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:32.680
 And it's not pretty 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.780
 moving forward 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:39.700
 Hey man. Why people - if you need to take a break, I would take a break 

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.700
 I appreciate the kind comments 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.040
 but no 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:44.660
 No 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.580
 Poppy Low Luck 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:53.460
 Poppy Harlow, according to Wikipedia, is a Swedish-Swedish news anchor 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.800
 Known for being an anchor in the world's most reliable news source 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.860
 Pew News 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.680
 Thank you, Wikipedia, for providing accurate information again. 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.020
 Chris is a chicken there 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.200
 Chris and I play the box of lies after the break 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:13.220
 Adhere to everyone, everyone 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.280
 Hey man 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.580
 Forged. It's fake, okay? 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.840
 It's not annoying, but it's fake 

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.260
 Do not waste my time with this 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:32.200
 9 years old = I miss Fridays with Pewdiepie 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:39.080
 I, think = I miss Pewdiepie roasting Jacksepticktank pretty much every video 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.560
 damn it. 

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.560
 what happened? 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.000
 Well, I think he died 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.100
 Where the girls cried, as the boys cried, as the children cried at nine 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.340
 . This is very beautiful 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.520
 You are all set of dolls 

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.040
 Goodbye, Gloria Burger, and hi Harley, with new unlocked characters 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.900
 Slippy gets back. this is good. that's cool. thank you. 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.860
 Imagine a conversation between these two people. 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.860
 Just give me another - a few more years on YouTube 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.860
 Me, I'll end up like that coo-coos 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.520
 Pewdiepie does not actually resign, it's just teasing Pewdiepie 2 release 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.860
 The curse 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.840
 No La Lau This is not true 

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:24.740
 Mimi Patch. There, everyone. 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.980
 Why not use brown hair color? 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:33.260
 Why continue to use this image? 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.780
 Mimi corrected again. Do it correctly. 

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:38.720
 Can we copy the Viking strike? 

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:43.720
 Oh really? 

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:48.900
 We still - are we still doing this? 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.080
 After six months, we get Ugandan mimes 

00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:55.080
 Wonderful 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:59.560
 You know, maybe if the black tiger appeared recently, I'll be like "Oh, that's funny." 

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:02.760
 Jesus Christ, he shouted 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.280
 Re "Please do not tell Marzia production". 

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:10.040
 This would involve going outside and actually photographing 

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:11.700
 I do not think so. 

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.380
 Jesus Christ, that's why I did not post anything on Twitter when it happened 

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.480
 Because so much of it seems 

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.620
 Hey 

00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:56.860
 I discovered this person died 

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.980
 Now I want to tell you 

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.380
 Just say rest in peace I - I remember Matt Whitney Houston 

00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:06.780
 Many people in my salvation were like "Rest in Peace Whitney Houston". 

00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:08.780
 I like "You do not give a fuck about Whitney Houston". 

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.140
 * Laugh * wait Whitney Houston dead? 

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:15.240
 Are you now debut at Whitney Houston LL .. 

00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:17.760
 Was the number one is number one? 

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.760
 Did you know that? CHRISTIE ?? 

00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:28.360
 "I modified it on the Wikipedia site and the person we saw and put it on REDDIT and got 1 K UPVOTES" 

00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:31.980
 * Laughter silent * 

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:32.480
 Breathe * 

00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.680
 "This is BULLCRAP" 

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:36.320
 * Laughing stocks in the background * I was never proud of the age of nine years 

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.320
 They were not so proud! (Thank you Pewdie I have the honor) 

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:40.320
 Well done! * Grip in the air * Yes!
