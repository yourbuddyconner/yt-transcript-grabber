00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.980
 This is the Ice Fjord of Ilulissat. 

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:03.980
 Miles upstream, 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.899
 behind millions of tons of floating ice, is the Jakobshavn Glacier. 

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:09.150
 And if the Greenland ice cap melts, 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.679
 a large part of the water will come down on this side. 

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.440
 But a glacier is not a fixed object, 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.970
 it is not a monolithic ice block that melts steadily. 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.180
 Glaciers are flowing. 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.360
 It's a counter-intuitive concept, 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.610
 because most people are accustomed to ice in the form of frozen lakes, 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:25.840
 where the ice goes nowhere. 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.710
 And let's be honest, this does not seem to move. 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.279
 But glaciers are not constant: they grow in mass due to snow falling on them, 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.079
 and they decrease in mass through a process called calving: 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.429
 the front breaks off and forms a stream of icebergs like this. 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:41.179
 Like a river, the glacier steams downhill. 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:45.120
 And the Jakobshavn Glacier is one of the fastest and most productive in the world: 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.289
 the end point, where the front breaks off, 

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:48.920
 can move 20 meters per day. 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.670
 And remember, that does not mean the front of the ice 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.649
 moves towards us at 20 meters per day, only that on average, 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.809
 the front piece of the ice moves at that speed 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.300
 if it breaks down and forms these icebergs. 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.949
 If a glacier increases in mass, it will continue quietly, 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.220
 spreading out at sea until enough falls from the front 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.560
 so that he is in balance again. 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.150
 And if he loses mass, 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.110
 because there is not enough snow because it melts faster, 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.150
 he will return quietly. 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.900
 Remember, it is not ice that really goes backwards, 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.250
 it still flows the same, 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.170
 the only difference is that the point where the front falls off moves backwards. 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.940
 He still produces icebergs. 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.700
 And the Jakobshavn glacier there? 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:27.850
 He makes a lot of icebergs. 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.810
 There is a reasonable chance that the person who caused the sinking of the Titanic came from there. 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.060
 Now I do not want to contradict climate change. 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.400
 Some very shrewd people in the reactions will probably do that 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.740
 so I say this: yes, the evidence is unclear. 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.700
 From 1960 to 2000 the front of the glacier has hardly changed - 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.090
 And in ten years, he has moved back about the same distance 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.810
 that he had shifted throughout the 20th century. 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.740
 But climate change is about habits, not events, 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.860
 and if you still do not believe the great mountain of evidence, 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.600
 then someone without geography titles who speaks to a camera at the North Pole will 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.590
 you can not convince either. 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.430
 And part of the reason is that it is difficult 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.509
 to convey the scale of all this here. 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.909
 You can not show the camera. 

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:12.760
 Even standing here in person, 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.359
 refuse to accept my brain how gigantic everything is here. 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:20.769
 And we can only see the 10, 20% that is above water of this one. 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:24.890
 Some glaciers make blocks of ice as big as literally all of Manhattan. 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.200
 And yes, they will break off, yes, 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.280
 they will end up as something we are more used to, 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.930
 but like many of the processes on our planet, 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.090
 this is on a scale that is almost unthinkable for people. 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.139
 It is no wonder that the details of climate change are so difficult to understand: 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.269
 I stand here, looking at the ice that flows slowly, 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.439
 and still I can not process it completely. 

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:48.700
 I am here with Chris Hadfield's Generator Arctic, and they too! 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.700
 -Hey! 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.599
 This is Elmo Keep, she writes great profiles 

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:55.540
 about a few of the people we meet here. 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.959
 Follow her on Twitter to see when they will be published. 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:57.459
 - Bye!
