00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.650
 I am not in a nuclear fusion reactor, if it is, then it would be great. 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.749
 This seat is at the European Union Ring Reactor (JET) at the Callum Nuclear Fusion Energy Center. 

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:10.630
 Behind the vent door a few meters away 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.890
 But there is not a place where humans can go in. 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.269
 Even for maintenance. Its danger 

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:18.939
 Not quite the same as existing nuclear reactors 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.769
 But it uses toxic base metals and things with trace amounts of radiation 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:26.730
 This is an isometric model of the reactor 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.289
 Used for training and teaching, 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.380
 If you think the picture looks a bit strange 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.230
 That's because the mirror is...you guys 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.309
 See my photographer 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:38.789
 Say hello! 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.510
 I originally wanted to say that my photographer is a robot. 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.879
 But strictly speaking, it is not because it is not a robot. 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.019
 Because it does not accomplish tasks independently 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:50.989
 It’s actually a remotely controlled robotic arm. Basically, 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:53.969
 It is an extension of John in the control room 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.940
 It's not as smart as a human arm 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.589
 But it has enough freedom 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:02.109
 Let you feel that you are there 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.500
 Not far in the control room 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.020
 You won't even realize that you are controlling the machine. 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.490
 But as if you are immersed in your own work 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.320
 You can see the various components around you in your mind. 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.340
 In addition to the photographic lens, we also have a virtual reality model. 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.700
 Give us very clear details so that you can work directly on the work surface here 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.509
 Imagine that the components are right beside you. 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:28.149
 In addition, its force feedback is very good, and the thin and tape-like objects feel it. 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.890
 If you gently stroke your arm across a smooth surface 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.530
 Can even feel the tiny details on the surface 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.829
 We also need to maintain the ceiling 

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.619
 So the transporter will carry the robot arm 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.750
 Upside down, up in position 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.439
 So the operator is still standing here but the gravity has changed. 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.460
 So we have to teach the operator how to deal with this situation. 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.659
 There are a variety of remote remote control technology 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.039
 One day, you can enter the practical application. 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:59.729
 For example: virtual reality, gesture recognition, 3D camera 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.109
 It’s all great stuff, if they work reliably every time. 

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:06.820
 And in the radiation environment 10, 20, 30 years later 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.010
 Still working properly 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.390
 This system can't be experimental, it can't be risky 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.620
 The only way to repair or update the mechanical arm of this reaction furnace 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.569
 Just send someone to come in 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.260
 You can't take risks on this kind of thing 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.269
 You have to use a device that you know is safe to operate. 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:33.690
 In addition, I just asked if I can operate the robot arm. 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.209
 The answer is yes based on the above reasons, but it is very slow to operate carefully. 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.060
