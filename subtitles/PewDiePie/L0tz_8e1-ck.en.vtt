 I took my communication while I communicated. 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.380
 This is correct, this is so much- 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.180
 I just realized that it is getting hotter and hotter, I think I got the point of it,

 He said: "This is the correct Jay Chou", although I like the red letter media very much. 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.880
 It really made me sneak. 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.080
 I am also that kind of heat.
