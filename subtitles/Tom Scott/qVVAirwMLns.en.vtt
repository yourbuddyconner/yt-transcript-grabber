00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 The last time I did a video about gravity ... 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.880
 I tried to make clear that gravity depends on where you are on Earth. 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.700
 Because of a number of things, including that the earth is not a perfect sphere, 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.560
 and what I forgot was the composition of rocks, but ... 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.220
 What you may not know yet 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.640
 is that gravity does not always point directly down to the earth. 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.700
 If you are standing right next to a huge mountain, 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.080
 something on the scale of Mount Everest, 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.260
 then the mountain will have its own gravity 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.960
 which means that the forces add up and 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.600
 Oh help! - 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.700
 The forces add up and ... 

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.840
 Here we go! 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.160
 Which means... 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.420
 Oh, this is to, this is scary. Oh help! 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.220
 Which sometimes means gravity 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.220
 do not point directly down. 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.920
 Oh jee. There is a sign there ... 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.460
 The lesson of today is that if the board says 'slow', 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.960
 Then it really means 'slow'. 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.180
 You can slide off a roller coaster! 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:17.420
 Do not believe the people who say 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.420
 that you can go down without having to brake. 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.720
 Do not believe someone who says, this is not dying at all 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.600
 and that you do not have to slow down around the corners. 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.120
 So! 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.300
 And if you do not 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.640
 then it hurts! 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:29.700
 Let that gravity sit. 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.500
 THAT is something that you may not have known yet. 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:40.580
 Injuries: 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.680
 Abrasions in four places, 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.680
 poking my hands through the thorns, 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.280
 and my pride has incurred a nice dent. 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.560
 Chris and Matt came down without problems. 

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.620
 So, as I said, 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.620
 gravity does not always point down, 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.040
 but remember that it does. 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.240
 Translated by Alexander 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:07.720
 Five minutes later... 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.380
 Let's see if the whole job can do without braking. 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.720
 What seems? He would not be without brakes! 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.700
 Wow!
