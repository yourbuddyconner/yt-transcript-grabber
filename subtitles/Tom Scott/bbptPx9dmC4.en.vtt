00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.150
 The junior winter Olympics led me to Lillehammer 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.620
 and to the biathlon shooting range. 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.729
 When I was a child, I watched the Winter Olympics 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:10.760
 and I could not understand the biathlon. 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.330
 It seemed too arbitrary to me. Skiing, 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:16.980
 then shoot at the target and ski again. 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.349
 It seemed to me to be an incompatible combination. 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.339
 But there is a reason to do so. 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:23.679
 Yes, the biathlon includes cross-country skiing, 

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.039
 but is based on former military training. 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.890
 You know how shooters say it's important to control 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.960
 and adjust your breathing. 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.379
 Well, try adjusting it after such a long ride. 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:38.920
 GEIR OLE STEINSLETT: When they come to the shooting range, 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.649
 concentrate on their breathing, look at the flags, 

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.960
 because the wind has a big impact on the bullet. 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.070
 They stand in position with their rifle, 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.079
 you need to charge a five-cartridge cartridge 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.079
 and put half a pound pressure on the trigger. 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.379
 They fire five times, put the rifle on their backs 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.000
 and set off as quickly as possible. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.800
 TS: I'm not very athletic. 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.070
 I can run 5 km, my pulse is not too high ... 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.239
 I can not compare myself to the athletes here. 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.220
 They reduce their pulse as much as possible, as quickly as possible, 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.619
 using different techniques. 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.040
 I do not think I can handle them like that. 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.630
 GOS: You have to be happy if you hit once! 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:17.340
 TS: Teach me to shoot with this rifle. 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.040
 GOS: Lie down. Next to your shoulder. 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.740
 TS: On my shoulder. Yes. I'm taking this. 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.850
 GOS: And then ... ready! 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.670
 TS: Done! 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.560
 GOS: There's a boom. A loaded rifle. 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.960
 TS: Okay. So ... I'm aiming at number 12 ... 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.920
 I missed it. 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.880
 GOS: Reload - back and forth. 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.720
 Hit the metal. 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.920
 TS: I hit the metal. 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.020
 GOS: Oh, hit! 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.159
 TS: Ha! Okay ... 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.120
 One out of five, okay. 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.710
 Now I have to get up and go. 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.000
 I can not ski. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.539
 That's what I will become 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:05.900
 and I will run. 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.360
 All right. 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.100
 It is very difficult! 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:29.360
 I did not think that ... 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.920
 it will be so important. 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.340
 But I really need ... 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.760
 ... to determine when to breathe. 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.040
 I did not even hit the metal with the last shot. Wow. 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.989
 I really did not expect it to be that difficult. 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.530
 I knew that breathing matters, 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.640
 but it was as if I was targeting a target that was on a moving boat 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.200
 up and down in front of me. 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.060
 And I was just trying 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.500
 to stop breathing for a moment to calm down. 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.160
 It just does not work out that way. 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.580
 Quite a tough sport. 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:12.920
 There are still many videos on the Olympics channel, 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.090
 as well as on my channel - watch them and subscribe. 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.129
 Thanks to the Youth Olympic Games 

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.930
 that they led me to Lillehammer. 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.720
