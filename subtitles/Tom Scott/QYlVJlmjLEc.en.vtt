00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.410
 Most people who speak only one language think that other languages ​​are similar to their language. 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.440
 Just use different vocabulary, different word order or different writing styles. 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.139
 Actually, there are many interesting qualities in other languages. 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.630
 Some are worth learning from English. Next, introduce four of them. 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.520
 The first type: tense independence. 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.840
 If you want to describe an action in English, you must say when it happened, or when it will happen. 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.770
 You must explain. The verb is thus deformed according to the tense. I danced - past tense. I am dancing, 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:28.560
 I dance - now. I am going to dance - in the future. If you don’t mention the tense in English 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.219
 There is no way to describe the concept of a person dancing. Relatively, if used 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:36.649
 Chinese? Verbs do not need to be deformed 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.100
 In most cases, the meaning of the text is clear. I don't mean that Chinese does not have a tense system. 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.719
 Just the tense is not essential. Don’t need to 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:47.839
 Appears in every sentence. 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.620
 Side note: The tense is not just simple, past, present, or future, in some other languages. 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.039
 There are also some lovely subtle tenses. I will mention it further in the video that follows. 

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:59.069
 In short, if you write a poem with a vague sense of time, then Chinese 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:00.640
 It is very suitable. 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.280
 Second: Inclusive. 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.860
 The word "we" is ambiguous. Imagine saying to someone, "We are in the middle. 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.600
 lottery ticket! ” 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.640
 This sentence has two meanings. First, "we" refers to the person who speaks and the person who hears this sentence. 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.960
 We have won the lottery! Excellent! Second, "we" refers to the person who speaks and 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.510
 The friends of the speaker... but not the one who heard this. We have won the lottery! But you are not in the middle. 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.250
 In an inclusive language, depending on whether the package does not contain the listener, 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.630
 Use different "we" to refer to. This characteristic occurs in South Asia, Australasia (Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific Islands) 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.070
 And in many languages ​​of the world, except Europe. I really hope that English is inclusive. 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.410
 Because it’s obvious, this feature will be for us – hey, we all 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.810
 Both are very useful. 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.220
 The third type: absolute directionality. 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.640
 This trait is not so practical, but it is cool. In some languages, especially some Australian indigenous languages 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.630
 Such as Guugu Yimithirr - there are a lot of research on it - 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.600
 Words that do not indicate "before", "after", "left", "right", always use orientation 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.019
 That is to say, "East", "South", "West" and "North". For example, in this studio, the north is there, 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:18.090
 Then I have a "North" foot and a "South" foot now. If I turn now, I have a "West" foot. 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.849
 And an "East" foot. It should be right. I am not very good at such simple things. 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.519
 But if your native language is this absolutely directional language, your brain can handle it. 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.469
 You will always know which direction you are facing - if you don't know, you will have trouble talking. 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.849
 As a language feature, I personally feel that the relative direction will be more practical. 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:41.620
 Especially for those of us who often go to the London Underground - but if you always know which side is north 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.249
 The words are pretty cool. 

00:02:43.249 --> 00:02:46.719
 The fourth type: evidence. 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:50.889
 As with the tense as an essential part of the English sentence, in many other languages ​​around the world, 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:55.579
 The argument is also an indispensable part of the sentence. If you are reporting something happening, 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:00.579
 You must include this element that you see with your own eyes. Of course, you can do this in English too: 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:06.109
 "I saw it" "I heard it," but this is not an essential sentence element. 

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:10.579
 Some languages ​​contain more than five types of statements, including: Do you see it yourself, whether you are personally involved? 

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:14.019
 Experience but didn't see anything, whether it was inferred from other things, 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.359
 Whether to relay what others have said... All these concepts are complicated to explain in English, 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:23.249
 But in a language that is eloquent, you only need to change one word. 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:25.219
 The ending of the word. 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:30.499
 All these wonderful qualities are one of the reasons why we should pay attention to the preservation of a few languages ​​around the world. 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:35.859
 If English dominates the world, destroy all other languages, 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.400
 What we will lose is not only the rich language, but also the ability of human thinking that can be seen from it. 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:45.659
 The question I am asking you now is: Can you come up with a new language trait? 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:49.379
 That kind of language should have, but it does not have the qualities. 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:53.310
 Next issue: Why things are not always black and white, or blue-green. 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.820
