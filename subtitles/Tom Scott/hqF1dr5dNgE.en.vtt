00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
I try not to do videos that are just "look at this thing",

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:04.040
but...

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.040
Look at this thing!

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.540
This is Bounce Below at the slate caverns in Blaenau Ffestiniog in Wales.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:19.500
It's three enormous trampoline nets, on three levels, in a slate cavern.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.840
And there are...

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.740
...people above me...

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:23.840
...and...

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.420
...people below me.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.280
I'm standing above a 100 foot drop, on a trampoline.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.640
I try not to do videos that are just: Look at this thing, but...

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.440
...this is incredible!

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:42.440
There are ladders, and chutes, and slides made of netting.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.820
If you're scared of heights, this may not be the thing for you.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:56.600
But whoever thought of installing trampolines, and ladders, and chutes in a slate quarry in Wales:

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.600
You are a genius!

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.660
It's like a cathedral made with netting, and it's amazing!

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.620
There's a chute, I can drop down here...

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.880
...it's just a hole in the net.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.440
Oh boy!

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.440
[SCREAMING]

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.980
I'm doing that again!

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.980
So there you go...

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.400
I'm exhausted, that was "Bounce Below"...

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.900
There's nothing you should've known here, just somewhere you really should go to.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.600
