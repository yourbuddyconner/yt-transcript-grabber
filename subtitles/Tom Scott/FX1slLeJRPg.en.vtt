00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 I am on the nineteenth floor of one canada square in London, and that is a beautiful sunset. 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.020
 And soon the sun will disappear under the horizon and it will be dusk. 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.740
 The night does not technically start, at least officially, until the sun is 18 degrees below the horizon. 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.360
 And until then there are three types of twilight. 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:28.360
 First, there is civil twilight, that is when the sky is still a little light and you can walk quietly without worrying about something. 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.260
 That is zero to six degrees below the horizon. 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.480
 The following is nautical twilight. 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.740
 That is when you can just see the horizon, under the sky, when you are sailing on a boat. 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.900
 That is six to twelve degrees. 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.680
 Finally, there is astronomical twilight, 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.760
 where it is just a little too light for the whole dull objects such as nebulae and galaxies to show up in the sky. 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.880
 That is twelve to eighteen degrees. 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:57.900
 Then, when the sun goes down, it becomes formally night. 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.980
 But it's like that. With high summer when it is very bright 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.100
 when the sun is high in the sky, 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.820
 the kingdom is northern enough that it never gets night. 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.980
 That we are constantly in twilight from evening to morning, 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:18.020
 until finally the autumn comes again and we dunk again in the night. 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.940
 America just does not get ... Vancouver, in Canada, just falls under that description. 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.560
 But the entire UK, and of course a large part of northern Europe, 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.380
 we have whole seasons that we never have ever, well technically, night. 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.100
 That is twilight. That is a beautiful sunset. And that is something that you may not have known. 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.940
