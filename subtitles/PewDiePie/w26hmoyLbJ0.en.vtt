00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.680
 The Elder Scrolls IV - The Forgotten Capital 

00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.680
 Some people say this is the best game in history. 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.100
 eye for eye!!! 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:17.200
 An immersive game world 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.120
 Make you feel like you want to be part of the game 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.680
 Then there is a combat system that I can’t get started with. 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.220
 Not at all 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.480
 do not move 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.980
 You are illegal, prepare a lawyer's fee or serve your sentence. 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.700
 Recently I was very addicted to the film of the Elder Scrolls IV. 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.000
 So I want to make a movie about this game, probably it’s almost like this. 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:07.120
 I played this game a long time ago, it is a super salty game, beyond the times. 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.760
 Looking back now 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.040
 (Can’t help but laugh) 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.900
 Not at all mad, and watching the wrong place in the game is super funny. 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:23.180
 Can only blame this game development is too ambitious, and then come up with a bunch of problems 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.110
 I think part of it is destined to be messed up. 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.720
 We will look at these issues together today, but without my words, but with my buddies. 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.780
 Todd~~~ 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.040
 Back to the cup 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.540
 Howard 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:42.440
 This type of man is the producer of the Elder Scrolls series. If you haven’t bought the Elder Scrolls series on any platform. 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.080
 He will be very disappointed with you 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.680
 "I want to be the quarterback of the Cowboys in the future." I said, "I will do video games in the future." 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.220
 "Intelligent obstacles, you still go back to chess club eight" 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.020
 See who is still laughing now? 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.240
 (explosion) (Kage face watermark) 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.840
 It was indeed a chess club for me at the time. 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.960
 (hiking) 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.640
 I like his super shameful saying, "I was a chess club at the time, but I am super cool now." 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.640
 Believe me, I did the Elder Scrolls IV, really God 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.780
 I think the major change in this game is 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.380
 In-game AI design, system AI allows players to be in this world 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.710
 Interact with game characters like the real world 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.960
 Then to reach the goal, you can observe the environment, see what works around you, and decide which ones can help the player to achieve the goal. 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.160
 So this game has... 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.160
 Super intelligent AI 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.540
 Look, another idiot, you can dance and have a look 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.300
 I will let your body dance and tear them apart. 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.920
 (turned to be tripped) 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:51.320
 (hiking) 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.740
 And not just smart AI, they really think about it. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.960
 m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~ 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.950
 m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~m~ 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.720
 m~m~m~m~m~m~ 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.720
 In this moment 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.580
 Jackson finally understands 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.960
 So fierce 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:19.160
 Smart AI, they also make amnesia in the game 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.060
 Look at these guards and kill the robbers. 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:26.060
 (inhalation) 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.020
 Oh my god. 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.280
 No... Sorry, are you okay? 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:30.040
 I... 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.120
 This person is dead 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:37.740
 It’s exactly what day, I didn’t happen, I killed people. 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:44.620
 Not to mention the perfect dubbing in those games, really 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.620
 Super fierce 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.700
 We have heard the thief break into the Yaken University, the area that belongs to the empire, and the temple, all on the night. 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.980
 Wait a minute, let me re-record 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:03.420
 We have heard the thief break into the Yaken University, the area that belongs to the empire, and the temple, all on the night. 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:06.500
 Take care 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:07.820
 well said 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.100
 Well said, I really fit into this game. 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.380
 This game really shows the breadth of seiyuu, I love it. 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.300
 Of course, those are all 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.800
 False, let them have an excuse to fool us 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.620
 Grateful, kindhearted 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.800
 You give him a little money and then 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:34.240
 Have you ever heard of an old man’s ghost looking to Nibin Bay every night? 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:39.340
 Peanut province mode? (They call him) How did he do it? He got the money. 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.980
 The second child is gone soon? 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.400
 Grateful, kindhearted 

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:47.600
 Have you ever heard of an old man’s ghost looking at it every night... 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.900
 My old swan 

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.520
 Fully compressable game space 

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.900
 Let the voices repeat the dialogue 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.280
 As long as there is dialogue, repeat 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:03.480
 They only need a seiyuu, instead of looking for a bunch of seiyuu, and finally come to make a collage 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:07.660
 Super ~ ~ he Ma Zan, then look at the money for the game characters 

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.930
 Just ask for enough for me 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.380
 Grateful, kind gentleman (grateful, kind gentleman) 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:17.590
 Your shadow bless you. Grateful, kind gentleman 

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:21.759
 Akatos Abani bless you 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.880
 Grateful, kind gentleman 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:28.980
 Your shadow bless you. (Awesome) 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:30.960
 Grateful, kind gentleman 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:34.140
 Your ambassador bless you. 

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.720
 Grateful, kind gentleman 

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:41.620
 Not to mention the superb underground maze exploration and in-game tasks 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.749
 You, what are you doing here? 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:52.779
 Did the parliament run away? No time, I am the only survivor (you are the only survivor?) Follow me, 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:55.359
 Thank God, you are the only survivor, at least one 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.330
 (I was immediately killed by the agency) Really super intelligent AI 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.780
 Maybe he is fine, you see, maybe he is fine (again) 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:20.480
 Forget it, he died. This game is also the ancestor of the mountain that poisoned other people's food, and then let them eat silently. 

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.279
 Like a professional killer, look together 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.489
 Welcome, have you heard Alga tell his story? 

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:36.920
 He is the best poet I have ever met. Of course, the poet is a sentimental, you are you. 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.440
 Take a poison and react immediately 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.080
 So they all ate poison apples (hello) 

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:44.360
 (A~~) 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:48.060
 Hello~ Ah~~~ 

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:52.160
 God 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:55.220
 Have you heard of the highlands? 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.400
 eat 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.300
 eat 

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.780
 Oh, my old swan 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:09.760
 Some people say that the conversation of the Elder Scrolls IV is a bit strange. 

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:13.940
 I am 100% disagree with this statement. Is this conversation super wonderful and super immersive? 

00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.519
 It makes me feel like a part of the game world and I live in it. 

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.460
 Very perfect, perfect conversation (Hello, how are you today?) 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:32.180
 I am Mirabelle Monet, operating a sailor hotel, sorry, the beds are reserved for the crew (harmonized with sperm) 

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.940
 (hiking) 

00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:40.040
 This is a classic case, you can listen to these NPC conversations. 

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.960
 You will really feel that you are living in this universe 

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:46.580
 It’s you, Hi. 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.700
 How did you do it? I met some Goblin in the woods not long ago. 

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:55.320
 Disgusting little monster 

00:07:56.419 --> 00:08:01.508
 It’s terrible, I heard that the elves train them, I can’t imagine 

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:03.469
 Bye 

00:08:03.469 --> 00:08:04.860
 Good Bye~ 

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:07.020
 Hello, Argonian 

00:08:07.020 --> 00:08:08.240
 HELLOOOO (Super Weird) 

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:10.240
 How do you do it? 

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.560
 Have you heard anything else? 

00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.059
 Good bye~ 

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:18.220
 Good bye~ 

00:08:18.460 --> 00:08:19.660
 Hello 

00:08:19.669 --> 00:08:24.698
 Well, there are a lot of imitations of these conversations, all of them are awesome. 

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.740
 I should go, I will meet again. 

00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:29.040
 Bye 

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.420
 Hi! Bye Bye 

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:39.640
 Hey, there are a lot of this, (go to send a letter?) (you know) (I might get it tomorrow) (hear it) 

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:40.980
 (high-five) 

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:47.280
 I think this is a perfect summary of this dialogue. 

00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:56.200
 Hello, we haven't... (Hi) Introduce yourself, I am Michael, you must be Alice (right) 

00:08:56.870 --> 00:08:58.870
 Nice to meet you, Alice, (me too) 

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:04.089
 Alice, do you want to go to my apartment (okay) Thank you 

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.950
 Alice, it seems 

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:11.259
 We all have autism, right? (Yes) Well, know it. 

00:09:11.810 --> 00:09:17.049
 I think Ah, we are very similar, Alice, it is very difficult to talk to other people. 

00:09:17.050 --> 00:09:19.930
 Before I met you 

00:09:20.779 --> 00:09:22.869
 I want to praise you. 

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.680
 Like saying 

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:29.380
 I think about it, what is praise? 

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:34.980
 Your eyes are brown like a trunk 

00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:37.520
 Pewdiepie is stunned (just an idea) 

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:46.180
 Oh, my god, I... there is only one way to get to the end, with super beautiful 

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.860
 Cute fans, this beautiful Asian will follow you everywhere in the game. 

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.220
 Yes, great and omnipotent hero 

00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:58.560
 Do you have any need? Can I help you with your weapon? (He can help you with a bunch of bad goods, can you help you with your shoes, or even brush your back) 

00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:03.680
 Can you polish your shoes? Or brush your back? Anything can be 

00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:04.840
 Sometimes you will wake up in the middle of the night and slippery in the pants. 

00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:09.300
 By this film super old, old swan 

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.440
 This time is long enough to upload Youtube videos. 

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.880
 By Azura, by Azura, by Azura. 

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:35.680
 It’s a big hero, Ah~~ I can’t believe that you are standing here. 

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:37.500
 Next to me 

00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:54.940
 No~~~~ 

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:17.820
 The Elder Scrolls IV, the perfect game, if you haven't played, I suggest you go find it right away~ 

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:20.060
 If you like it, just like it. 

00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:24.740
 Go buy a fingertip gyro, see you next time~ Bros, I mean, SISTERS~~~ 

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:27.860
 See you in the next video.
