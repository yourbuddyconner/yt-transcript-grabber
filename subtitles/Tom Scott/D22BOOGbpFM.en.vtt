 I am in Swindon. It is not the most picturesque city in Britain, but what it does have 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.819
 is this: the Magic roundabout. 

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.050
 and yes, Britons, you probably already know this, but the Americans: I guess 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.280
 that you are going to find this a bit scary. 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:18.019
 Five mini roundabouts, around one central roundabout that goes the wrong way. 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:21.289
 If you now look at the history of this and how it originated, then you will see 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.460
 that the CBRD has a good summary of the history of how the Road Research Laboratory 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.119
 it came to make this, but what I want to talk about is the idea of ​​emergent behavior. 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.079
 Because most of these drivers do not have special rules to drive here. They do not work 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.660
 plan in advance. They follow simple rules: 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.480
 Prevent collisions. 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.609
 Follow the lines. 

00:00:40.609 --> 00:00:42.989
 Give priority to people who are already driving at the roundabout. 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.179
 And point in the direction of your destination. 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:50.609
 As with birds, a few very simple rules can create a very complicated swarm behavior, even 

00:00:50.609 --> 00:00:53.260
 if each of these individuals does not know what happens. 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.409
 If you want to know more about it, look at "Boids", made by Craig Reynolds, 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:03.199
 in 1986. Intricate swarm behavior, generated in a computer, with very simple 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:04.360
 rules. 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.170
 Follow these rules here and you will arrive safely at your destination. It is not necessary to 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.930
 plan in advance, you do not have advanced driving skills or hundreds of times 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.200
 to have done: you just have to follow simple rules, like birds do that massively. 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.430
 Emergent behavior means that this strange roundabout is almost never a traffic jam, even during 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.600
 peak hours. It is a triumph of road design, but there will probably never be anything 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.049
 to be built similarly. The magical roundabout, here in picturesque Swindon. 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.040
