00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.900
 Good evening . I am Bobby Harlow and you are watching Pew News 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.040
 First news. "Tanakun" You're tired of listening to her. I'm tired of talking about her 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.230
 If only we go to it. Trust me 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.760
 There are some good hot news here that you want to know about !! 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.488
 To those who do not know Utopian "Tana Mango" has met 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.739
 In a conference at the same time as "VidCon" and in the same place as "VidCon" 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.079
 I dispel all the lies that have spread 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.128
 To summarize it was the disaster of thousands of young fans were waiting outside in the sun without food. No water 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.770
 Without any cover for hours until he finally got the effent done 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.140
 And disappoint the fans who thought they would meet their favorite creators, you know 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.380
 Perhaps the parents themselves obviously are spending a lot of money on travel and hotels 

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:09.940
 The ticket itself was just useless, and the first blame we were told was that 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.460
 15 thousand people 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.589
 Only magically appeared unexpectedly and there is no way for anyone to just 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.430
 Controls that position 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.119
 And 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.500
 Many people bought it so I bought it at some point but later it was a lie of 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.160
 The police statement from the city park and police department in Grove said that only 4,000 tickets were sold and only 1,000 were sold 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.260
 Of people actually fit to fill this event 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:44.080
 Then it caused a lot of drama and speculation as far as Tana knew and good times for the event organizer 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:51.640
 Did they know about this and there was a lot of going and going and was not really sure what exactly it was 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.100
 What is wrong and who is 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.560
 Who is responsible for these two concerts? Is Anna a Michael of the good times? 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.540
 Well, we now have the answer you like good conclusion. Thanks to the latest video by Shane Dawson. it's a 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.380
 A close friend of Tena Mungo 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:15.620
 So we get the inner truth and sorry not only the truth about Tana Mongo but the real truth about 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.840
 Tana Haha 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.240
 Now the video is 41 minutes long and I am sure I would recommend watching it if you are interested, but in any case I will 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:29.180
 Summarize it to you. It's basically 30 minutes of unrelenting convulsions 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:45.440
 Does anyone know what to say ?? Scientists are still trying to figure it out. I'm Bobby Harlow and I feel reassured 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.600
 I will do my best. We work around the clock to decrypt this talk 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.540
 In my opinion you are showing that you have done a really good job 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.640
 He gives the most balanced view of this situation because he may be able to do so 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.080
 They are said to be friends. This will not be a fair offer 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.460
 In my opinion, this kir was from "Tana" 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:19.940
 She consistently goes behind Michael and blames him. It does not have many options to play at this stage - because I do not know 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.000
 I still trust him alone. He repeats this again 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.170
 I do not understand anything and you still have not answered the last ten questions for you 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.200
 = You just keep turning the subject - because you do not let him speak Jesus Christ and I'm sitting there like 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.500
 It does not matter .... I can agree 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.320
 You feel you have been betrayed, but you think the event will deal with it 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.190
 It does not matter which is important and I'll tell you why they knew 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:51.850
 both of them 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:56.759
 They knew both Tana and the good times knew .. 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:07.400
 That the event was carrying only a thousand people, and they knew that they sold tickets for five thousand people, which is not surprising 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.560
 At any time I work with a company, the first thing to be reported is how many things we sold or how many? 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.100
 Without None Without None 

00:04:13.109 --> 00:04:19.409
 We know how many units returned the profit that we made relevant information and the fact that they were demonstrating 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.450
 = They do not know any of these - this good capacity probably goes down to 3,000 people 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:34.840
 We can only be more responsible and drop them from five thousand to three thousand 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:43.140
 Which is still treble for many people who both know also know that the hotel accommodates 1200 people 

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.720
 But what is this? 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.690
 I 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:54.980
 I did not say 5200 now. I love that. I loved it for us 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:05:02.000
 Yes, do you like her now Tana and the last part that bothered me so much 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.120
 The last one that really is 

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:07.360
 It bothers me and I can not 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:09.020
 Let's just occupy it 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:15.770
 It would be really wonderful to have people abroad waiting and letting people love being oppressed abroad. Yes really 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.360
 Tana Mongo people like to be suppressed abroad 

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.760
 People like to be suppressed out Tana hello in case you are watching 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.820
 I hope I have a message for you to say in the video of Shin 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.400
 Often you want to make it good that you may want to improve the situation 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.320
 But you do not know how you are so overwhelming 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.680
 They let a lot of people go down and I want to do it right, but I do 

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.300
 This is madness. This is not something I thought would happen, I do not know what to do 

00:05:56.340 --> 00:06:02.800
 But I have to make you right. You're lucky because I know how to do it well and I do not say so sarcastically 

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:07.940
 Here's what you need to do. Hide your channel. You obviously do not deserve to have an audience 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.940
 The oppressed people 

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:16.940
 Abroad your audience was the people who cared for you people who paid the money to see you for me 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:23.840
 This is a perfect example of ego greed and the greed of money being collected and the creation of this giant mess and ultimately 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:28.160
 Everyone loses only me because I get the content for criticizing me 

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:33.920
 I mean, I enjoyed it 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.520
 Women want to suppress outside 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.260
 The following news every time deafness occurs in relation to a video game 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:50.900
 Usually it comes to someone playing for 40 straight hours until playing for several consecutive days and recently 

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.780
 We have seen 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.400
 More and more movement towards the idea of ​​damage games 

00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.620
 The White House for example denounces that 

00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:07.500
 Video games caused school shooting Who rated disorder games as a mental health condition 

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:11.020
 We talked about this on this channel, but we have not seen before 

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:18.440
 Psychological death related to video games at least as far as I'm concerned so far good morning 

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:21.780
 We'll start this morning by talking about a free online game 

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:26.260
 After the police and doctor warned the deaths of its dangers to children 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.140
 It's called Doki-Doki 

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:35.820
 "Club Literature" The game begins as a dating group in high school and includes a group of moving girls at a book club 

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.640
 Things turn nasty with characters, hurt and self 

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.740
 Killing themselves said they would be suitable for players aged 13 or over 

00:07:45.740 --> 00:07:50.600
 Launched last year and downloaded 2 million times in the first 4 months 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:58.880
 An investigation into the death of a 15-year-old boy named Ben Wormsley from Bari, whose father said about the game, will be investigated 

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:06.020
 His son was dragged into it and reported that in Manchester News he had found a 15-year-old boy now dead and his father 

00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:09.560
 The forensic doctor has warned about the online horror game. he was playing 

00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:14.590
 Doki Dokki Literature Club. This has been covered in many different media 

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:19.060
 Do not let your child play the Duke Dokki Literature Club before reading this little late time now 

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:24.300
 Is not the father saying that Ben was growing fast. Difficult for parents 

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:30.320
 But this has to be highlighted, there is no confirmation so far, but we think the game can be linked to Ben's death 

00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:35.140
 So they do not blame the game completely for the cause of death. They just say it's a potential cost 

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:41.840
 This is not really what causes echo through the Dokki and Dokki media are the first stage of this 

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:48.960
 The side event is because of it but what you noticed while reading the few articles is that it 

00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:56.350
 Game description does not exactly match the way you play. You know, I played the game on my channel 

00:08:56.350 --> 00:08:58.560
 People liked it and were really popular 

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.260
 It's an amazing game in my opinion and the fixed point being 

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:06.960
 Repeat in this article that the game will not leave you alone 

00:09:07.280 --> 00:09:11.980
 I will be drawn to this .. This does not describe Doki Doki in my opinion 

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:18.460
 But well, then in another article is indicated that the game is an online game 

00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:22.680
 It is not so I do not know where they got this information and the father 

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:24.380
 The game describes the characters 

00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:28.200
 Your friends and they love you and give you tasks to do but if you do not 

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:31.080
 They turn into sinners, this does not describe them either 

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:39.260
 Then finally after reading this .. the game has been linked to his mobile phone and will be contacted by text message during the day and night 

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:42.640
 Often it awakens. This is when I realized 

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:50.840
 They are not talking about the literary club Doki Doki. They're talking about another game. So it appears here in another article 

00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:52.920
 They're talking about 

00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:59.740
 Mystic messenger is a game where you send a message to people who will give you notifications at random points 

00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:07.560
 At least I think that's what I imagine is what he meant by a game that pulls you into a game. This free fits everything 

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:09.480
 It all fits perfectly 

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:15.880
 If you go to the doki-doki sweb site, the game does not appeal to it that it is not something 

00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:19.340
 Imagine us playing this colorful game and it really is 

00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:25.700
 An extensive plot to anyone it's a horror game people know you are going on the website and referred to in the description 

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:31.980
 Psychological horror The first text that shows is that the game is not suitable for children, and those who 

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:33.050
 Easily inconvenient 

00:10:33.050 --> 00:10:39.840
 But then, I thought it was interesting because unlike these other games related to death, this game is actually very short 

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:46.540
 Do not focus on your withdrawal or keep you playing or keep you hooked on the game like many other designed games 

00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:47.810
 These days 

00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:49.420
 After the publication of this article 

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:56.020
 One parent said the same thing that their children had had trouble sleeping and stopped eating 

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.060
 There were no clear signs of what would happen 

00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:02.200
 But there were many things that happen with my son and Doki Doki is just one part of it 

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.220
 But I need the death of my son to have some meaning now 

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.460
 I can not imagine what it's like to lose a child and me 

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:12.840
 I do not know what a hardship it is like to be a parent and I am not 

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.000
 Blame any father 

00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.120
 Sometimes terrible things happen without good reason 

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:24.500
 But in my opinion, a video game does not make you do this at least in the doki-doki literature club 

00:11:24.520 --> 00:11:28.280
 It's not just a reasonable claim and I'll be sensitive to the "Sonic" 

00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:31.000
 I mean, raise your finger here and 

00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:38.560
 "As a parent, you should have a focus on what your child is doing online or in front of a computer," says Biodepay 

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.600
 You focus on what they do in their daily lives 

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:47.920
 I think many parents do not realize that children are growing up practically in front of their computers, and that's a huge part of 

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.200
 Their social interaction to some extent needs to be monitored 

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:56.860
 To prevent this kind of thing from happening and the fact that the parent in this incident described 

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:00.480
 Another game described as the Club of Literature Doki Doki 

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:07.620
 At least to some extent that they do not know what the child was or at least did not understand and understand 

00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:08.880
 This is confusing as well 

00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:13.780
 But what really amazes me here is how poorly the media coverage 

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:19.080
 With almost every news article referring to doki-doki when it is clear 

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:25.300
 That's not it. What do you think? What are your views? I want to hear them 

00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.620
 Let me know in the comments kind of Downer 

00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:31.820
 It's not the most fun news to talk about but I think it's important though 

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.940
 Finally, I appreciate all the support on Bio News
