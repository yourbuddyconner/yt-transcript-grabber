00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.620
 Let me tell you a Christmas story 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:07.029
 Or, a Christmas hoist, for this is from a time when computer files names 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:09.110
 was limited to eight characters 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:11.050
 It is December 1987 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.120
 Ronald Reagan was the US President, Margaret Thatcher was British Prime Minister 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.310
 And home computers had just become a reality 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.619
 The few who had them, however, were not really connected to others 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:22.590
 machines. 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.390
 We were still two years away from the internet head was invented 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.470
 And at a small university in Germany 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.050
 was a student by writing one of the first major computer worms 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.239
 It was called "Christma" 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.140
 Simple program, it only ran on one type of old text, omm 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.780
 now old, text-based computer 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.129
 Back then it was the latest 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:46.160
 It showed only a piece of text shaped like a Christmas tree 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.090
 But while the user looked at it, 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.800
 Went through 1987's version of the computer's contacts and emailed himself 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.910
 to all addresses in it 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.199
 "Let this exec exec" said it - "exec" is a executable file 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.940
 a program you start - "and enjoy it" 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.640
 By modern standards of Ransomeware and identity theft, 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.130
 was this a pretty innocent virus, 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.360
 although it copied itself so well and convinced so many people to open it, 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.770
 that it dropped one of IBM's networks for a few days 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.299
 - And that was when IBM was still a player of importance 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:17.960
 In fact, it did it twice 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.650
 It re-emerged three years later, presumably 

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.470
 someone forgot what it was when they searched through their files and opened - 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.200
 "Oh yes, that's the fun little Christmas card again" 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.420
 Which leads us to a question 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.750
 That kind of attack is still possible now, on modern hardware 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.150
 Not the same program, but that's how much malware is still spread 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.020
 You convince the user to download a program and then run it 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.130
 and it gets access to everything on the user's PC 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:46.810
 Internet, webcam, personal documents, ALT. 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.360
 Email is not a good way to spread that kind of thing anymore, 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.040
 But web pages offering pirate downloads do the job as well 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.420
 And yes, there are other methods 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.189
 there are zero-day attacks on Flash actually, 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.340
 many zero-day attacks on Flash. Actually 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.149
 It is almost only zero-day attack on Flash right now 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.710
 Zero-day means that no warning is given 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.739
 zero days from the virus are released and infect people 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.410
 and Adobe trying to patch on Flash, again - 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.069
 There are other methods 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.410
 But eventually, if you say, Hey, to a user 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.500
 Free music, free pirate software, 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.750
 Free Christmas backgrounds for your PC, whatever you want 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.230
 you can get them to pick up something and run it - and then it's over. 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.290
 There are some measures today 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.540
 Windows has user account control and built-in antivirus 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.500
 and Mac and Linux have administrator accounts and permission management, 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.860
 but if Malwaren tries to do something about the important parts of the system, 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.760
 it will be stopped as long as the user does not just press the OK field 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.910
 or write their password, but let's be honest 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.489
 It happens much more often than it should 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.620
 But even without permission 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:57.120
 Even if the virus you downloaded can just use your account and yours 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.400
 files: 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.510
 It can still do a lot of damage 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.810
 It can encrypt all files in your personal drive 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.430
 all your photos and business contracts 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.819
 and lock them in until you send Bitcoins to an anonymous person far away 

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.159
 For the computer that naively runs a program 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:16.590
 There is no difference between a virus that damages 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.129
 and the user who deliberately drives something to do the same things 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.060
 You can't make a filter against malicious behavior like that 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.730
 without having an almost perfect model of what the user thinks 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.230
 and what they would like to do 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:30.030
 There are sometimes, sincerely, 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.140
 you want to delete everything on a computer 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.659
 However, there is another resort 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:38.230
 And we use it all the time. 

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:43.409
 For example, on an iPhone, each app has its own separate area to store data 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:48.049
 There is no central area that all apps can access at once 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.200
 Imagine that PC was made like this: 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.299
 all reports or homework made in Word 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.319
 are only available in Word 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.200
 And if you want to send a report to someone. 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.510
 or convert to another program 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.689
 Don't go - if you wanted to attach the file to an email program 

00:04:05.689 --> 00:04:07.180
 don't you go to the email program, 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.760
 Press "Attach" and direct through your centrally stored documents - you open Word 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.599
 and you are asked to push one file to the email program 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:19.070
 All your music would only be available in the program you downloaded it 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:22.019
 until you pushed it somewhere else. 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.720
 And right now, all the technical people who see this, all of you. 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.210
 I'm out there and say. 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.270
 "oh it would be terrible, it's a nasty thing, 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.449
 It would mean that we would not be free to use our computers as we wanted 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.460
 how should i link these three different programs together 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.360
 to do this strange thing I have to do "? 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:37.600
 And I understand it. 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.919
 I sincerely understand it. 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:42.820
 I support this kind of scam with enthusiasm 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.669
 and for anyone looking deep into their system that knows the way around 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:50.600
 this kind of advanced fashion is needed 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.940
 But why didn't we build that kind of system, 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.100
 those for the not so technological, disgusting? 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.669
 Because we never had the opportunity 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.300
 The PCs we have today are descendants of the old systems from 1987 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.789
 There was not enough space or power at that time to give each application 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.250
 its own small silo and control it separately - by the way 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:13.780
 In many cases, the programs were just writing ones and zeros 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.699
 Computers were for academic use, for professionals, 

00:05:16.699 --> 00:05:21.449
 so it was really expensive equipment to be treated with care 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.289
 But for the modern normal user, for people who are hit by Ransomeware 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:31.940
 and for those who lose all their family photos: I'm not sure that system works for you. 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.630
 Do normal computer users really need to see C drive or Macintosh HD? 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:40.580
 Should they worry about folders and backups? 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.060
 We have that system because it has to work with previous generations 

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:48.500
 because we never had a clean break from PCs 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.030
 Even Apple has said that their users are moving with time 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.259
 They give some years of forgiveness for staying up-to-date - and, blessed 

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.880
 Windows is still happy to run programs from twenty years ago 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.740
 There has never been an opportunity to start a fresh one 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.750
 If they ever stopped using that metaphor with folders of files in one central location 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.330
 - and it has been promised plenty of times - 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.919
 All the old programs will stop working 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:15.160
 But for all the brand new devices that we have only had in the last few years? 

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:17.789
 For tablets, phones and Chromebooks, 

00:06:17.789 --> 00:06:22.680
 with their locked systems? In the scenes, they use guaranteed 

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.770
 Still there there directories and files system 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.389
 but it is not visible to the user 

00:06:27.389 --> 00:06:29.470
 As such devices become more and more popular, 

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:34.160
 and the PC's market share begins to decline, at least for home use: 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.440
 Maybe we could leave that old system 

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:41.569
 and computer security will be just a little better 

00:06:41.569 --> 00:06:42.919
 Except. 

00:06:42.919 --> 00:06:46.449
 One of the reasons why Britain has such a strong technology industry now 

00:06:46.449 --> 00:06:48.449
 is the home computer boom from the 1980s 

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:53.660
 when the BBC Micro and ZX Spectrum founded a generation that could program 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.830
 We see authorities working and working on children to find out computers 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:03.669
 so they know they can write the future as well as they can read it 

00:07:03.669 --> 00:07:10.009
 And as much as the confinement of computers and systems might make everything more secure: 

00:07:10.009 --> 00:07:12.740
 One cannot write iPhone apps on an iPhone 

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.370
 and someone has to write iPhone apps 

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.870
 so no matter if you hope for a new laptop with files and folders 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:22.930
 or a new phone with separate data silos 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.050
 or maybe a little less technologically under the Christmas tree: 

00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:28.759
 Merry Christmas to you. 

00:07:28.759 --> 00:07:30.810
 And whether it is digital or physical 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:33.410
 No matter whether you are writing programs or painting art 

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:35.550
 or, just build a snowman: 

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:37.680
 here is something for the next thing you do, 

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:40.669
 and we will see in 2016 

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
