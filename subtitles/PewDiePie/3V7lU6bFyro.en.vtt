00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.880
 I really have to go to the toilet, we can wait with this video please 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.040
 You are watching BioNews! 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:17.080
 * Music Introduction BioNews * 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.100
 Apparently, people have been urinating from left and right lately 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.360
 Oh 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.300
 What did you do? What did you do? 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.360
 A few days ago, I played a video that tested an eye tracking tool 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.080
 Basically, you can see where I'm looking at this screen 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.460
 So I asked people to submit videos about what I should see 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.460
 Of course people send me Twitch Boobie Streamers 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.420
 I am very joking just said it randomly in the video "stupid click thots!" 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.340
 "Stupid ... Click on the picture". 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.600
 It's very hardcore stuff. 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.480
 I certainly understand why people see it in a very negative way 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.180
 Well, as it turned out, the name of Alinity washer 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.380
 You had some things to say or do about it, 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.000
 Pewdiepie: This is very annoying 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.060
 Stupid ... Click to Tweet. 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.580
 I just feel they - they won me, okay 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.440
 They will not win over me 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.260
 Stupid twitch clips. No. 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.260
 Alinity: Se-Seriously? you said that? 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.900
 I will copy the blow of this man 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.360
 Just for that word 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.320
 Will copy them 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.180
 You are! 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.880
 Can we copy the latest Pewdiepie video strike? 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.880
 Like now? 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.420
 He called us Twitch foci 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.020
 Pewdiepie: Now, I saw it very soon afterwards - it happened in the table 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.120
 Uh, I never want to bother people with videos. 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.320
 I, I just thought it was easier to cut 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.040
 But before we can do this, 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.640
 Do the video actually, yes, get a STRIKED version 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.520
 Swing and blow missed 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.120
 For me, uh, it is such a memeable word 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.360
 It does not necessarily have any negative connotations with it 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.880
 I certainly did not mean it in a negative way 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.760
 It's just a joke 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.680
 But I want to apologize to Alanti and be clear 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.540
 The aim was not to hurt or disturb anyone. 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.958
 Alinity had a big problem with my use of this word 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.030
 Just like anyone else saw it. 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.780
 We are devastated 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.020
 Washer: Yes, honestly the fact that I was in his video 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.020
 (*get ready*) 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.800
 Is crazy! 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.040
 Now, we were not sure whether, uh, 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.480
 Alinity who actually did COPY STRIKE 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.540
 Swing and blow missed 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.500
 Or if it is just a random claim 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.340
 Because I get it all the time 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.100
 But the next day 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.900
 I have followed this up, 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.760
 Where it's kind of bragging 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.140
 "Yes, I've been men" 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.440
 Now again 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.540
 I can not view the section but - and I would not recommend anyone to watch it 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.280
 Because it is probably the most clips that can be seen from anyone at all 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.260
 Sitting with a bowl of spaghetti, 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.460
 Slap away go 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:52.860
 * Eating noise * 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.100
 "Yes, I was not on my way" 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.300
 And then, you can not get a pattern over this. 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.480
 This is legally transcription 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:16.940
 * Text Message * 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.780
 (* Good money *) 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.980
 A good copy of money infects people 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.760
 Alinity, the most popular genius of all time 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.860
 Ehhh 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.900
 Of course, publicly admits 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.280
 L, uh, abuse of copyright law Basically, 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.080
 It is an illegal act that can be held in a court of law 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.900
 My videos are 100% protected from fair use 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.120
 They have - standing on their feet. 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.960
 They had my own comment 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.060
 They often work as reviews often 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.719
 I interact with the content, but I add my own comment which gives criticism towards it 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.260
 It is a transformative act that stands before the courts or at the very least 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.900
 We've seen it. Stand before a court of law similar to H3H3 who sued another person 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:03.100
 Youtuber did not like what they said until they took him to court by copying the striking copies 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:10.470
 Which is pretty similar to what happened here to a much lesser extent where 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.360
 I did not like what I said so I wanted to download my video or at least claim good money for it now 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.499
 I'm used to dealing with this kind of thing. There are opportunistic people all the time 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.589
 I lost earnings from my videos because of the background track that was parodying someone else's track for a long time 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.510
 So a lot of things happen all the time 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:38.039
 I've literally had two of the second screen clip getting all the revenue from the video without saying what the reason is 

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:46.340
 This shows me how easy it is to abuse YouTube's legal justice for fair use and to see someone who brags about it 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.380
 So openly and uhh arrogance 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:56.860
 It's very serious. So, basically, collaborate with the company DRM that hits my video. They need licensing videos to reduce 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.909
 So they agreed to do so basically and that's why they took profits from my video 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:07.950
 Imagine if I did something really bad and everyone would answer it then I could 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.940
 Get ready by claiming all revenue from this video primarily 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:18.020
 Control all these videos if I do not like what someone says about me I can claim this video and this is toxic 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.180
 Environment that will destroy YouTube only. So we see people misuse this seriously 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.710
 It is very dangerous and very harmful 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.500
 I am happy because this whole thing is showing to light 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:33.320
 Although I feel bad for Annette because she does not know clearly how to deal with this situation 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:38.940
 Now this whole thing blew up a lot of votes. Many people may have pressed it 

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:45.719
 So I issued a statement now, I did not think it could become more undesirable, but it turned out I was wrong 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.790
 I did not even put this whole thing down until I read this statement. This is very stupid 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:58.080
 The reason for his reaction is that frankly I am frustrated by the widespread racial discrimination in the Internet 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.280
 Societies. It certainly looked like this 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:08.920
 I thought it was because of good money. You are making videos of beatings. they. I'm dealing with someone like Felix 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.890
 Insulting women into a largely young audience 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.840
 Your audience is 12 years old hoping to watch some split. are you kidding me? 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.960
 What is the phantom that you must have to offer these kinds of phrases? 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:27.520
 This kind of nonsense gets into my lap and ends up being harassed for six hours 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.200
 I brought this whole situation to yourself and no one but you 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.560
 She then went on to blame the sympathy for the whole thing, saying all that cooperation does 

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.680
 Without my knowledge, I will remember that I am frankly because they claimed the videos clearly 

00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:45.060
 Transformative works 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.060
 Can we copystrike Pewdiepie? 

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:50.700
 I'm very upset at Collab to claim this video 

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.500
 But can we copy Pewdiepie? 

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:58.660
 I did not want this to happen and I'm sorry. What do you want after that? 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:02.189
 You are talking about this video called Alinity Dance Group 

00:07:02.189 --> 00:07:08.100
 It is a collection of game-only dance games that I enjoy but videos 

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:14.400
 The intended goal has nothing to do with the game I love; it is just a convincing video 

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:19.440
 How can they recognize me? I do not understand. I just play a game 

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:26.020
 I just play a game I really enjoy explaining. I just want to play this Just Dance game. 

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:29.500
 Why do people object? I do not understand it 

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:32.680
 I do not understand why 

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.199
 This statement was omitted 

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:37.859
 I suppose he did not get the reaction she was hoping for 

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.219
 Then I finally went to PhillyD to talk about this whole ordeal 

00:07:41.409 --> 00:07:46.949
 This is what I mean is the only thing I know about how this word is that they pay me 

00:07:46.949 --> 00:07:48.940
 So basically because she felt helpless 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.520
 The PhillyD White Knight is here 

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:58.320
 Congratulations, she was powerless. I only know they are paying me. That's all I care about 

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:03.080
 I do not understand how Collabdrm works, but can we extract Pewdiepie? 

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:06.300
 I do not understand how to get a salary 

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:08.900
 But can we ask Pewdiepie, by the way? 

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:14.460
 She did not know she just did not know she was being bombarded by people to feel power 

00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:17.080
 She said I could do it and at that point I explained 

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:23.960
 The situation where Collab was supposed to be just a claim for videos where there was nothing to transfer because she trusted the company 

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:25.960
 She trusted the company 

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.280
 Poor woman 

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:34.620
 This is a story about the abuse of a company that benefits from Alinity 

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:41.440
 We can copyright Pewdiepie? Ok, Collabdrm is a very big company. They must know the law. Everything must be fine 

00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.230
 I trust her and I think that's how she works 

00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:48.800
 That's why this incredibly unfortunate situation seems to have this. How did this happen? too bad 

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:52.980
 So because she does not want to feel like a victim she swells her chest acting like 

00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:03.020
 Anything else tells me that although there is a contract with her, they will try to get out of it 

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:09.500
 So it no longer works with Collab. How noble she says she basically did not actually tell Collabdrm 

00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:16.640
 To hit my channel and Collabdrm themselves they confirm that it's true that they just hit my video 

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:18.060
 They work with Alinity 

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:20.100
 They did not beat her because 

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:27.660
 Alinity told them that this information was superfluous because she said I would demand the video that the video received 

00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:34.410
 The allegations were made and then I got credit in the end for the video that was claimed after that because everyone suddenly shot it 

00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:40.700
 The story is suddenly different from the Collabs error. one more time. Finally, I'm sorry I'm sorry to call you tune twitch 

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:44.440
 I will definitely be careful in using this word in the future 

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:52.170
 But you have to stop blaming others. Stop Blaming Collabdrm Stop paying kind of sexual bias stories 

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.040
 Stop blaming me and 

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.800
 He admitted that what I did was wrong in fact not difficult 

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.080
 I know what it's like to be under fire by the Internet. I did not have to use any of these excuses 

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:05.160
 Have you ever heard of the impact of Barbara Streisand? 

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:08.730
 There is a woman trying to sue a cameraman to take a photo on her house 

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:11.189
 The photographer did not know she was her home 

00:10:11.189 --> 00:10:17.060
 Just as I did not know what the hell was and by prosecuting this photographer. You may see what I'm going here 

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.760
 Everyone is discovering this picture of the house, which is the opposite of what you want 

00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:29.280
 Yes, maybe I was wrong because you were invited to threaten but you brought this whole situation to yourself and no one but you 

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:35.920
 This leads me to the second part and most of all this. Frankly, I do not care about Alanti this whole thing 

00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:40.720
 Hypocrisy about the whole situation. It is funny and funny to me to ridicule 

00:10:40.740 --> 00:10:46.100
 In order to flesh and bone the most dangerous video from Collabdrm company hit the channel 

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:53.560
 I am more familiar with them and understand their actions and understand what they are trying to do if they have 

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:56.380
 Video license and want to claim ownership of it 

00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:02.860
 I have no problem with that, but it seems to me that they often do not take fair use into account 

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.400
 Alinity interacted with my video just as I interacted with it 

00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:10.160
 Why can you claim all my video revenue for it? 

00:11:10.290 --> 00:11:16.999
 For a 4-second hole they later admitted that it was a human error, but in fact it did not happen all the time 

00:11:17.040 --> 00:11:18.440
 I had like I said 

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:24.440
 I got two screams of my second voice to get all the video revenue that has nothing to do with the video 

00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:28.360
 I saw only one image appear for a few seconds 

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:34.440
 Claim all video revenue in the same way as fair use and the copy strike system now 

00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:41.060
 Is that if your company asks for your video, you can appeal it, but it's up to that company to say yes or no 

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:46.540
 Of course, they will misuse this power. Of course, they have a lot of strength at this stage 

00:11:46.550 --> 00:11:52.639
 I am happy that this has emerged. We hope these companies will be more responsible in the future 

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:56.990
 The last thing is as I said, I understand if you want to license your content 

00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:59.539
 But if you are interested in protecting your content 

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:02.740
 You will say at least what your license is 

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:07.700
 If you go to the Collabdrm site, they say they are receiving the claim. My video is fair use 

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:10.100
 Why do you claim that? None of this is true 

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:15.260
 If it does, can you give me the exact timing of a violation that appears to be true? 

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:21.760
 If my video is claimed, at least you know why you're claiming it, but our mission is not to help creators 

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:26.200
 Control their content by not helping the intruders avoid claims. I'm a builder. 

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.720
 You do not help anyone 

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.250
 You just take the revenue 

00:12:29.250 --> 00:12:36.040
 This is an ideal example of these patent companies that misuse patent laws to claim revenue instead of fair 

00:12:36.340 --> 00:12:39.520
 Product protection is exactly the same thing happens 

00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:43.280
 But with video content, since YouTube does not want to access it 

00:12:43.380 --> 00:12:49.220
 These companies misuse this power, and this is one of the issues that led to this whole ordeal 

00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.180
 She had this strength and that is why she became very transparent in this case 

00:12:53.180 --> 00:12:53.860
 Think 

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:59.579
 YouTube must actually make it so that you have to say what part of the video is claimed or at least submitted 

00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:00.160
 Option for 

00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:06.660
 Ignore this video if just a picture appears on the screen just make the screen black at least give us this option 

00:13:06.740 --> 00:13:13.700
 This video will be monetized 100% if the number of views reaches 50 thousand fans Gloria Borger 

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:17.640
 And you're watching and you've been phill'd in 

00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:31.000
 * Pew News music outro * 

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:33.360
 ASS is available on everything
