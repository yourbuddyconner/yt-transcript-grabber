00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.030
 Ok... 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.200
 Some jokes are really pretty good. 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.860
 Especially some.. you know 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.880
 When you are doing a live Q&amp;A session 

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.260
 There will be some weird questions 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:12.420
 One of them is 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.760
 "Mark, is it true that those who say you are actually a lizard?" 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:20.020
 I can only say that I am not 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.140
 I am not a lizard 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.140
 However, very, please keep these high quality messages. 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:27.460
 it is good 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:28.260
 it is good! 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.820
 it is good! ! 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:29.320

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:31.860
 it is good! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.060
 Mr. Cypress, you jumped and jumped yourself this time. 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.300
 *Suck* Mr. Kebo!!! 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.380
 ** suck ** Kebo!!! 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.940
 He claims that he is not a lizard 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.880
 He claims that he is not a lizard 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.260
 We found that Zuckerberg’s behavior is weird. 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.800
 Have been around for a long time 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.340
 Has been happening since the emergence of the MEME 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.660
 "The first class baseball teammates" 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.740
 "This is a new instagram filter feature. 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.740
 This is my favorite one. 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:58.080
 First class teammates" 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.200
 *Repeat* This is a new Instagram filter feature. 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.800
 This is my favorite one. 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:04.500
 First class teammates 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.229
 It seems that there is a ghost behind Mark Zuckerberg’s identity. 

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.320
 What are the facts we are facing now? Why is this man? 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.240
 Why a man who leads social media 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.400
 Not good at all 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.000
 Social 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.400
 I want to remind everyone, then I want to show you 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.080
 Will shock you 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.120
 it will 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.120
 Let you vibrate (shock) 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.660
 Especially you, Mark 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.080
 If you are watching 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.080
 I know you are watching, Mark 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.640
 I know that you have scared the cold sweat. 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.840
 Oh, are you still sweating? 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.580
 Mark? ? 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.120
 You will sweat this kind of human.. mechanism? 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.580
 Or are you only skinning? 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.460
 "You sometimes have to remind yourself that you need to concentrate, try not to let the anecdote affect you." 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.640
 "But they will still distract you because you are alone." 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.520
 "I used to be" (? 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.760
 "I am also... I am still a human" (Translation: Diablo 3!?!?) 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.740
 .............. 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.000
 *laugh* 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.000
 * pumping * we continue to watch 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.580
 "But.. um.." 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.560
 "But...just talking about me in the past" 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.340
 "Ok.." 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.300
 "Not saying that I am not a person" 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.280
 *Repeat* I am just talking about me in the past 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.560
 *laugh* (so this means...??) 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.300
 That kind of normal person will not suddenly say it. Ok, Mark? 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:22.920
 Ok? 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.700
 "I used to be human"! 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.540
 That usually does not happen at all. 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.460
 Normally okay? 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:28.260
 You are not normal at all 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.000
 Normally, I won’t say something at all. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.180
 Usually not to say 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.720
 Like a word that is completely spoiled by the public, very aggressive and offensive (translation: pewd's recent Nicole event) 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.400
 But they will still be private - forget it. 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.700
 Anyway, no one will speak like this! ! MARK! ! 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.420
 I want the truth! 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.660
 "But they will still distract you because you are alone." 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.900
 "I used to be.." 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.740
 "I am also... I am still a human" 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.720
 "but.." 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.660
 They cut the picture to the audience. They had already arranged a drone to stand by behind him. Hey God! 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.500
 God!! The situation is out here, the gray warning!!! (Translation: Gray = Terrorist) 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.260
 What are you hiding in the mark - suck? 

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.020
 Why do you use tape to seal the lens and microphone of the notebook? 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.980
 Is it every time you go to the molting cycle? 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.240
 They won't find it? 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.820
 And I, I know, because we are the same kind 

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.320
 I mean we are all... 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.900
 *belch* 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.060
 I know 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.940
 I just know it 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.100
 I have an intelligence source 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.620
 I have a reliable informant 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.880
 Tell me you are a reptile 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:25.940
 OKAY? 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.200
 This is a great body language analysis channel 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.640
 Let’s see what they think of sucking Cypress. 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:32.460
 "and so" 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.800
 "to me" 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.980
 "I have always been fascinated." 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.000
 "It's just people." 

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.180
 "And how people work" 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.280
 "You will notice..." 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.180
 "Let's play it back" 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:47.540
 "I didn't expect the film to suddenly cut his face from him and observe that he was sitting very straight." 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.140
 "Hand on your knees, head lifted to the chin parallel to the ground" 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.500
 "This person is facing Mark." 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.880
 "He put his face down slightly, so he is surrendering to Mark and hiding his hands with his hands." 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.160
 "Mark body language is open, indicating that he is leading the communication in this space." 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.880
 "And he is consciously doing this action." 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.040
 "I will explain how I know it." 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.680
 "...and how people work" 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.780
 "I have studied psychology and computer science when I was in college." 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:13.640
 "quite long" 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.230
 "Very frequent eye contact" 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:21.360
 "He is deliberately doing this exchange and then briefly diverting his gaze. He also deliberately thought about something to talk about, and his eyes exchanged for a brief pause." 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.220
 "The purpose is to dominate when to stop." 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.940
 "And you know what you have to learn in psychology." 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.660
 "Our head has these parts" 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.200
 "It is like this...." 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.180
 "How long does it take to see him keep in contact with his eyes?" 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:34.940
 "When you usually face an object of surrender" 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.600
 "And you lead this communication, like what he is doing now, using his body language to communicate with his eyes." 

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.500
 "You will give your time to rest and give yourself a body to relax, and you can relax with them." 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.900
 "So you can make this exchange a harmonious atmosphere." 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.100
 I really feel that we.. um.. 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.580
 We are getting closer to the truth. 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.160
 What is this alien creature and so on, is there any? 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.440
 It is trained in human behavior imitation 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.320
 "A lot of things happened along the way, I think" 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.580
 "There are always things in us that give us a lesson or become a turning point." 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.320
 "And now in public, he can't help himself sweat." 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:12.700
 "That is a few body language that is difficult to control..." 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.760
 No, no, he won’t sweat. 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:15.480
 He can’t flow out of the reptiles. 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:16.320
 I'm serious 

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:20.220
 "kenneth's message: "Mark, I don't think you can suck it." 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.480
 "What the hell? Come back to me and tell me what it is." 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.800
 "I try to help you see" 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.720
 "What is Zucker ZUCC? I have never seen it" 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.680
 *Imitation* What is the sucking ZUCC? 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.660
 *laugh* 

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.700
 Uh 

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:44.540
 *Small voice *He is talking about lazy 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.480
 As early as Jarvis, "Mr. Mark is today is Saturday." 

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.120
 "So you only have 5 will open it." *Facebook CEO designed a new virtual assistant Jarvis* 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.640
 "Room is set to a cool Fahrenheit 68 degrees." *Yes, God also called Morgan Feynman telling Zucker at his room temperature* 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:00.840
 "At the beginning of this year, I started to design a simple AI to help me deal with everyday life." 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.500
 "I use this self-developed AI program" 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.700
 "To let Jarvis understand my instructions" 

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.120
 "And find a way to execute" 

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.640
 "Max had gotten up a few minutes ago, I was teasing her." 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.480
 "Let's come and see her." 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.360
 "Javis your Mandarin is heart-warming" * Jarvis is smart enough to teach your child Mandarin* 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.640
 "Thank you" * Jarvis is smart enough to teach your child Mandarin* 

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:24.160
 "Jarvis also helps me prepare for my morning." 

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:24.960
 "Give me clean clothes" 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:25.740
 "Open fire!!" * Jarvis obviously also part-time basketball game with guns to shoot out the running dragon * 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.360
 * Jarvis obviously also has a part-time basketball game with guns and clothes to come out. 

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.460
 "This is like a word" 

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:31.660
 "Jarvis can also broadcast our favorite music" 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:33.840
 "Let's play some good songs of five cents." 

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.020
 "I'm sorry, Mark, I don't think I can do this." 

00:06:37.940 --> 00:06:40.280
 "The five cents don't even have a good song." 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:42.720
 "Good! That is actually testing you." 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.120
 Five cents is bad to the soup, right? 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.940
 Hahaha 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.140
 Yeah, five cents is rotten. 

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.780
 *Singular smile* 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:52.120
 Five cents rotten 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:52.960
 a ha ha ha 

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.700
 They are the worst, hahaha. 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:56.800
 I hate them because everyone hates them. 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.840
 a ha ha ha 

00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:59.800
 Have you heard the crocodile card? Ah haha 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:02.600
 Who will wear them? Right? Ah hahahaha 

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:04.100
 I can't think for myself 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.300
 Ah ha ha ha ha ha 

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.800

 "Jarvis also helps me prepare for my morning." 

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.600
 "Give me clean clothes" 

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.600
 "fire" 

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:23.160
 * Interrupted video* 

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.420
 "Javis can also play our favorite music" 

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.740
 "Well, broadcast some of the music that our family loves." 

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.400

 *Input to eliminate human * 

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:42.640
 "Hand slipped" 

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:46.900
 Oh... 

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:49.420
 I think I like the part of Mark most. 

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.600
 Is his sense of humor 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:53.020
 This is really - 

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.480
 Really a must 

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:01.660
 "Hey, welcome to F8!" 

00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.000
 "The reason we are here" 

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.180
 "This is the second large-scale expo called F8 this week." 

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:13.440
 "Then you should guess that I will play this stalk" 

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:17.200
 "Because I just played the game and I just released it." 

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:18.940
 "There's none?" 

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:20.960
 "Our fault" 

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:27.260
 "Today, although we can't get Jushi Johnson to come here, we have the same amount of technology as he does." 

00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:29.260
 David"the Rock"Marcus 

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:38.380
 "And we may not live in the moment" *And while we may not live our lives a quarter mile at a time 

00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:43.160
 (From the end of the life of the 7th end of the Tang boss: I often say that my life only live in the 1/4 mile of the race means that only live in the moment) 

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.900
 Did you come to the fu? The joke awakened something in my body. 

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:56.780
 "And we may not live in the moment now" 

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:58.620
 *laugh* 

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:09.000
 *Imitate* and we may not live in the moment right now 

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:13.900
 ****Synchronized laugh **** 

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.940
 "At least I know someone is spending a lot of money" (each time I spend a quarter of my salary) *one quarterly earnings at a time* 

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:25.660
 "Come, let me endure, I still have a joke." Don't don't want to suck. 

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:29.080
 I can't keep going. "The golden sentence of the game is 7" 

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:31.080
 "Never give up on family" 

00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.140
 Hey~~ He has to say 

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:33.420
 "Our one is almost the same" 

00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.060
 "Never give up home programs" 

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:39.120
 "Not as good as the original" 

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.200
 *尴尬 Cancer episode* "Not as good as the original" 

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.200
 Ah... my god... 

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.900
 This must be the stem of their industry. 

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:50.140
 Please be at least their own stalks. 

00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:51.160
 My goodness 

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.040
 "That is the speed of scientific progress." 

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.060
 "You can probably call it" 

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.140
 "Fast &amp; Furious" 

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:01.540
 *Von Di Sore Cancer* 

00:10:01.820 --> 00:10:06.180
 What are the stalks that have been playing for life? This must have been sponsored. 

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.820
 Is sucking in suggesting that he has been sponsored 

00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.360
 But the official is not marked # sponsorship? 

00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:20.300
 Mark you.. at least you have to sponsor or advertise on it. 

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:25.680
 We have just been bombarded by these jokes, and there are sequelae like those of cancer. 

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:31.960
 Hey, are you helping out with propaganda but you haven’t officially used at least 48 #advertising tags to whitewash your newsletter? 

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:37.800
 Then put some super big trademarks and broadcast the sponsored Divine Comedy "The sponsored 喔, sponsored 喔" 

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:39.760
 "I am collecting money." 

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:42.320
 Honestly, what happened? 

00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:43.840
 This this this.. which one 

00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:46.500
 What is the conspiracy to conquer the world? 

00:10:46.620 --> 00:10:48.660
 They even made it so obvious on the Oscar. 

00:10:48.880 --> 00:10:51.060
 "Hey, broadcast a good song of five cents." 

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.900
 "Five cents is Satan's minions" 

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.280
 "One praise is equal to one prayer." 

00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.940
 "Messages are below" 

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.140
 "If you ignore this message, you are equal to hating Jesus." 

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:00.000
 "Good! That is actually testing you." 

00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:02.540
 "Or broadcast some songs that our whole family loves." 

00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:08.800
 *it's everyday bro* 

00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:14.220
 If you like, just press it and remember that every praise is equal to one sucker.
