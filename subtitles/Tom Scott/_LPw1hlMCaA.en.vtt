In any Hollywood movie, if someone has to dial a phone number, it will start 555

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:12.500
and there's a reason for that, not only is it American tradition, but the 5550 block is blocked out

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:19.000
across America, for dramatic numbers, so all numbers that start 5550 with a couple of rare exceptions,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
will never get through.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.860
Now, there have been a couple movies that have tried to use other numbers because hearing 555

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.800
does take you out of the action a little, and Bruce Almighty managed to spark a whole load of people

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.420
trying to call God when his number was flashed up on screen.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:43.480
Now of course that's slightly worse in America because the caller doesn't just pay for the phone call to a cellphone, the person with the cellphone pays as well.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.780
So, suddenly, someone was getting 20 or 30 calls an hour and all they were asking for was God.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.540
What you might not know though is that Britain also has numbers like that

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:59.620
in one of the few good decisions that Ofcom, the regulator has ever made about phone numbers,

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.320
there are a few blocks marked out. In London, it's 0207946, there's several blocks in cities across Britain,

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.880
and for rural areas, an entire area code, 01632 that is guaranteed never to connect.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.620
There's a mobile phone number too, 077009, that whole block will never, ever get through to anything.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.160
And at the exchange level, well, it just cuts you off straight away. If you're on a cellphone, you'll never get through.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.700
And if you're on one of these, an old-fashioned land line, you won't even get halfway through dialling it before

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.120
you get cu- [PHONE CUT OFF SOUND EFFECT]
