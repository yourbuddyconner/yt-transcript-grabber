00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.910
 In Britain, the reaction to the Panama Papers case was a bit strange. 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.170
 Politicians either publicly revealed their tax returns 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.800
 and in the attempts to prove that they have no foreign accounts, 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.200
 or strongly protest against having to prove, 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.240
 that they do not have any foreign accounts. 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.700
 One of them said that to ask politicians to publicly reveal tax returns, 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.200
 is "similar to the Stasi or KGB practices". 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.720
 Welcome to Norway. Behind me is the Oslo Finance Office. 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.920
 And if you want to know how many politicians take the money, just ask here. 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.420
 It's not just politics. 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.510
 You can ask anyone. Tax returns have been public in Norway, Sweden and Finland for several years. 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.899
 These countries differ in how much information they provide 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.350
 and if you have a good reason to ask. 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.379
 But your revenue is substantially public. 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.399
 Now we could do what every television station would do. 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.409
 We could make a cut for interviews with Nora on the street, 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.089
 where we would ask them. 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:03.260
 Or we can go about it scientifically 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.009
 and look at an article from Microsoft Research written by Ricardo Perez-Truglia. 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:12.990
 It combines two things. First, the survey Norsk Monitor, 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.960
 which is carried out every two years, investigates a representative sample of the Norwegians 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.479
 and includes, among other things, questions about happiness and contentment with life. 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.549
 And secondly: Finding someone else's tax details has changed from: 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.469
 "You have to go and go through a lot of documents, 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:28.899
 which is only allowed three weeks a year, " 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:34.140
 to: "Newspapers have made everything online and even have a search box." 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.770
 The article concludes that the opportunity to look at wages, 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.229
 that's a chance to see if you're better than the Jones family 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:40.789
 or Johansen, 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.240
 does not make the people happier overall. 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.719
 Instead, it increases the abyss of happiness. 

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:48.950
 When you know you pay more than your neighbors, 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.049
 you are more likely to be satisfied with your life. 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.840
 But when you know you're worse than they are? It's going to make it worse. 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.899
 Still in Norway you can look at tax returns online, 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.090
 but now you must sign up for yourself as a taxpayer 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.369
 and everyone can see who searched for them. 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:09.269
 This is another social game than before. 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.150
 But there is another good argument for the possibility of tracking wages. 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.360
 The world would be fairer. 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.659
 We have no verified information yet, at least I have not found them, 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:20.300
 and it would also be very hard to measure. 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.230
 But we have good unofficial information. 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.989
 Specifically, from a Google engineer who created a spreadsheet, 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:28.390
 where his colleagues could voluntarily share their salary. 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.190
 The story about it and the way it responded to it is definitely worth reading. 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:34.970
 And we also have evidence that they say, 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.170
 (although they may not like the politicians) 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.780
 that public disclosure of tax returns reduces the likelihood of tax evasion attempts. 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.060
 So it means I'll publish my tax return 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.209
 and show the world how much I've earned last year? 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.840
 No. Because I'm Brit and 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.750
 The British do not talk about money, because it's unpleasant and 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.450
 you can learn something that you did not want to know. 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.269
 Or hurt somebody too. 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.310
 So my response to salary reporting is the same as that of many other people: 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:03.410
 You discover the first. 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.960
