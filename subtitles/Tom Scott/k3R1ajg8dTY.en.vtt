00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.290
 TOM: Everyone on the plane is unconscious. You are the only one who can land the plane. 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.409
 And you have never flown a plane from your life. What are you doing? 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.311
 I am at 'Virtual Aviation's' simulator of a million pounds, here in Cambridge, 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.470
 with Morag and Matt, and my job is simple. 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.960
 Land the plane, and show how you can do it. 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.522
 You know, just in case ... 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.829
 And do not forget that this is part of Comic Relief's 'School of YouTube'. 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.480
 Everyone here present sacrifices his free time to make this possible, 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.770
 but also remember that we are doing this to raise money for children around the world. 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.700
 Children who have limited or no access to education at all. 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.009
 Details on how you can help are now in view, 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.140
 and if you can donate, please do that. 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.430
 All right! Let's land this thing! 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.820
 GORDON BURNS: Tom, approaching London Heathrow, 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.211
 very heavy side winds that fight him. 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.300
 TOM: Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa ... 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.999
 GORDON BURNS: So wrestling with the steering column. 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.140
 Returning the steering column to the center stops the rolling of the aircraft, 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.830
 He has to send the plane in the other direction to get back on course. 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.510
 TOM: I'm too high! Get the power off! 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.100
 GORDON BURNS: In the wind wobbling, he returns the thrust 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.509
 to steer down the nose of the attendant. 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.211
 But I think that was too much. He is flying too low. 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.340
 COMPUTER: Pull up! 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.500
 TOM: I try! 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.240
 GORDON BURNS: There is the warning system that orders him to go up, 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.850
 and he has the nose up again, but is it enough? 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.940
 Is he coming down the runway? 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.610
 He is almost on the ground, he is in front of the runway and he leans to the left. 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.900
 TOM: That is technically on the runway! 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.180
 GORDON BURNS: Not on the runway. He must be glad that there are no buildings there, 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.400
 but he has a problem, and I do not know if he realizes that. 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.120
 TOM: [laughs] 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.060
 TOM: Why ... why do not we stop? 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.480
 GORDON BURNS: But he accidentally turned off the automatic brakes, 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.779
 so he will not come to a standstill. 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:44.040
 TIM TAYLOR, INSTRUCTOR: And we have crashed. [laughter] 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.120
 GORDON BURNS: But not a bad attempt from Tom. 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.320
 Morag follows. Does the hair get better? 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.111
 A number of lights next to the runway help her at height. 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.400
 When they are white, she knows that she is too high. Red means that she is too low. 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.140
 But she has trouble with the side winds. 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.900
 She just has to stay calm and bring the 737 back on course, which is fine. 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.860
 And she will be helped by the height and direction meters. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.600
 COMPUTER: Too slow! [Alarm] Pull up! 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.010
 GORDON BURNS: She sends too much, 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.960
 and she has to go up again. 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.800
 And now she has done too much of that, she is now too high. 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.580
 With the runway for her - there is' ie, she now has to slow down to land, 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.060
 so she's in trouble here. 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.420
 This plane is currently getting away from her, 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.500
 automatic explanation for emergencies is now going to be a bit too furious against her. 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.240
 We are on our way to the runway and there is only one way this flight can end, 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.070
 and it is not good. 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.520
 Now Matt sends the plane, 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.920
 and it looks good at this early stage. 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.290
 The flight-route instrument shows him that he is almost exactly on the right route. 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.760
 GORDON BURNS: And now he needs the little ... 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.520
 MATT: Oh hello! [laughs] 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.080
 follow purple diamonds with the steering column 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.340
 and that will keep him on course. 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.440
 And he is currently on course. He uses the thrust lever very skillfully 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.130
 to change its height. He remains calm. 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.920
 Small changes to his route bring him on the exact route. 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.660
 And he goes straight to the runway, and he seems content with that. 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.980
 This is a very good approach, the job gets the job done cautiously. 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.480
 Is he going to miss the runway, probably not, he is a bit off to the left ... and ... 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.090
 that was probably the wing that hit the runway, but it is on the ground. 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.240
 And now he uses the rudder pedals to send the plane back to the runway. 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:28.150
 And that, Matt, was a very good attempt. 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.940
 So at the end of the round, at the end of the game, 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.300
 Matt is clearly the winner. 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.120
 MATT: I think I put it to the ground! 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.160
 TIM TAYLOR, INSTRUCTOR: Well, yes, you did! That was the best attempt! 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.480
 MATT: Yaaayyy! [bright smile] 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.020
 TIM TAYLOR, INSTRUCTOR: You are the only one who has been able to land on the runway. 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.880
 [laughter] 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.480
 TOM: If ever you are the only one who can land the plane, that's how to do it. 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.860
 And if you've learned something, please, 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.880
 help someone who can not. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.140
 Six and a half euros a Zambian orphan can go to school for a month, 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:56.440
 and he could even get a meal there every day. Perhaps the only ones they get. 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.560
 So please, pick up the phone, click on the link now, and donate if you can. 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.940
 Thanks to 'Virtual Aviation', thanks to Gordon Burns for the voice-over, 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.810
 and thanks to Comic Relief for organizing all this. 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.780
 That is how you land a plane in case of emergency. 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.600
