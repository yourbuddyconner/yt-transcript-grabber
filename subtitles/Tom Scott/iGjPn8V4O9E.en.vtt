00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.320
 Ok, come and go to Russia. 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:04.440
 Go to Russia! 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.870
 Russia. 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.190
 If you are a British tourist, it is not that simple to go to Russia. 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.400
 You have to book your trip first. 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.509
 Then ask the hotel you are waiting for to send a formal invitation. 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.520
 Then you need to apply for a visa in a few weeks or months. 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.720
 You can't fly directly to the plane and ask them to allow you to enter. 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.430
 And you absolutely must not drive directly across national borders. 

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:31.689
 They are being monitored at that pillar. 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.270
 Hey - right! They must be! 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.360
 Because the top is convex. 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.270
 - The base station usually goes straight up - there will definitely be a special number 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:39.640
 - The base station usually goes straight up - there will definitely be a special number 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.120
 The number of people entering the car and leaving the car. If they see someone walking towards that... 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.220
 Well, yes, that's where the camera is. Find it well! 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.690
 Well, yes, that's where the camera is. Find it well! 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.470
 I will want to come up with a zoom lens, but I will not do it on the Russian border. 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.780
 The place behind me is "Saatse Boots", (because it is shaped like a boot) 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.420
 It is highlighted by Russia to the land of about one square kilometer in Estonia. 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.730
 When Estonia is still part of the Soviet Union, this is not a problem. 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.360
 But when Estonia became independent in 1991, 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.330
 Village at the end of "boots" 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:09.280
 (including Saatse here) is separated. Until recently, 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.080
 There is only one way to go to this place. 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.260
 There is another way now, 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.080
 But the original road is still the fastest one so far. 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.400
 Therefore, for the sake of convenience, Russia allows people to open that road... 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.920
 ...as long as they don't stop. 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:22.710
 That is the prohibition of the stop sign. 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.430
 Well, one kilometer can't stop? 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:26.390
 That's right. Did you see that pillar? The red and green ones. 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.790
 - There is Ah - it is it, there is Russia. 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.570
 If you walk into Russia, you may be arrested. 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.700
 If you drive, you have to keep on. 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.720
 If it stops or breaks down, 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.350
 You just entered Russia and you may be arrested. 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.430
 Estonia...Estonia... 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.310
 - Russia! - We are in Russia. 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.939
 At this time, everyone will start to ask, "What level can this rule extend?" 

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.630
 What if you ride a bicycle? 

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:54.640
 What if I open a speed of one inch but never stop? 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.170
 If you stop at a semi-border place, 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.049
 Or what if you stop taking a bunch of photos in Estonia? 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:05.250
 If you loudly put the songs of the villagers’ orchestras in Russia, 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.579
 What happens to the law that prohibits the promotion of homosexuality in Russia? 

00:02:10.579 --> 00:02:14.069
 The answer to the above question is: I don't know. 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.639
 It depends on whether there are border guards to see it, but also how they feel about that day. 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:20.489
 They may send you back to Estonia. 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.319
 It may also arrest you for one night. 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.529
 But no matter what, we don’t want to try to kill. 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:29.319
 After all, it’s a very, very bad idea to joke with Russia. 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.010
 Not to mention that they are on their territory, and they are still on the video. 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.879
 And like other complex boundaries, this boots problem 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.319
 It will also be resolved at some point. 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.579
 Formally speaking, this boot problem has been solved, too 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:44.090
 The treaty signed in 2005 was delivered to Estonia and then again in 2014. 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.279
 Russia agrees to get other places in Estonia 

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:49.849
 Give up the piece of land in exchange. 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:52.060
 Estonia! 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.370
 -that's it! -Yes 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.669
 But diplomacy is slowly coming, and bureaucrats do the same. So far so far 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:04.870
 It is still feasible to drive a small piece of Russia without a visa. 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.059
 Just be careful. 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:10.079
 We just drove Russia without a visa! 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:11.619
 Wow. 

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:14.949
 In fact, I feel a little bit of an anticlimax. 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.440
 Hi! Tourists, yes.
