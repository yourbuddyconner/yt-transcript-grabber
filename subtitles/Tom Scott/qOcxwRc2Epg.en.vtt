00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.450
 Twitter has been set to support 140 characters. For the English alphabet nothing complicated, 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.100
 one character means one letter, number, space or punctuation. It's with computers 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.030
 we agree more or less. And if we lived twenty years ago, that would be the exact way 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.170
 the system could work. Exactly thereafter, no more. 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.260
 However, we now use Unicode. 

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.180
 This is still easy for some languages. For example, for East Asian languages, 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:28.120
 Chinese, Japanese, Korean, one character means a symbol, number, space, and 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.420
 punctuation mark. However, since these languages ​​are written more together, 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.300
 each character can hold more information than in English, even up to twice as much 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:39.609
 in each tweet. 

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:41.660
 Then it is more complicated. 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.040
 For example, what in Arabic counts as a single letter? The shape of the Arabic letters depends 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.220
 on their position in the word. Watch what happens when 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.620
 when I take the Arabic alphabet in Arabic and I will squeeze the backspace. We write from right to left, remember. 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:00.800
 Characters change so they do not break the rules of the written language, 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.119
 and the diacritics disappear independently of the letter to which it belongs. 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:09.979
 In Vietnam, each letter is counted as one character. 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.240
 We just cut them off. 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.359
 At this point, most British programmers, including me, are giving up 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:21.310
 and prefer to use some existing code created by a generous soul who has already solved it. 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.299
 Or if they are lazy, they will say that no one who does not speak English will not use it anyway 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:26.729
 and that we do not have to worry about it. 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.020
 (TIRE) Yes we must. 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.390
 Unicode has one character for some English ligatures, like "ffi" - note how the letters are 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.179
 close together to make them look better. Some programs 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.539
 it will automatically populate for you so if you copy and paste such text 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:45.749
 to Twitter, you save the characters. 

00:01:45.749 --> 00:01:50.119
 People would count this as 3 characters. Unicode, therefore, Twitter as well 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.350
 almost every computer program? Just one. The best example is 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:01.530
 Arabic is written "Peace with Him". Unicode has one Twitter character for it 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.020
 it takes 1 of 140. This is definitely good if you are a pious Muslim 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.149
 and you want to talk about Twitter prophets. 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.670
 So what is actually counted as one character? Well, it's complicated. Computers see it differently 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.050
 than people. And let's be honest: if you are not a professor who writes essays by 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.250
 the number of characters instead of the number of words will only be useful for you, 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.110
 when you write tweets. 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.340
