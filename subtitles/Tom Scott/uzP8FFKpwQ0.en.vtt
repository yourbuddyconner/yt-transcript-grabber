00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.580
 I am in Tromsø in Norway. 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.940
 That's the Tromsø bridge, 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.240
 and there is the beautiful ice sea cathedral. 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.880
 Well, if you've watched my videos the last few days, 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.880
 then you might have noticed something crazy 

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.440
 every time I am under artificial light. 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.440
 And let's be honest: That's the way most of the time. 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.320
 Because, even though it gets light here in the middle of the day, 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.360
 we are in the Arctic Circle, 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.020
 it is winter. 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.020
 The sun does not rise above the horizon. 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.000
 Mind you, when it gets light, this place is very beautiful. 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.640
 In any case, you may have seen a bit of a weird effect, 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.680
 if I make a slow motion video of that lamp post and the ground beneath it 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.580
 you will see what I mean. 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.020
 There is a kind of weird 'rolling' flashing light effect. 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.360
 And the reason for that 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.840
 is something you might know, 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.060
 the difference between European and American electricity networks. 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.540
 See, the European electricity grid runs at 50 hertz. 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:42.820
 50 cycles per second. 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.100
 That means the alternating current in the cables 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.580
 changes direction, 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.740
 a hundred times per second, 50 cycles 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.460
 back and forth, back and forth. 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.160
 And that means all these lamps that you see here 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.420
 a kind of unnoticeable dim, 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.940
 a hundred times per second. 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.920
 Not enough so you can see it with the naked eye, 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.640
 but the camera picks it up. 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.280
 Well, okay, that is not a big problem 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.080
 if your camera is running at the same speed as the lights. 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.600
 The lamps run at 50 hertz, 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.600
 British television runs at 50 hertz. 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.620
 But unfortunately, I use an iPhone, 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.360
 which is designed in the USA, 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.900
 for the American electricity grid. 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.840
 The American electricity grid has chosen to run at 60 hertz, 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.400
 60 cycles per second, 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.780
 so American television runs at 60, 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.360
 or 30 frames per second. 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.020
 So, the camera records at 30 frames per second, 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.640
 the light pulses with 50 hertz, 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.060
 those two do not run synchronously, 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.700
 and so you sometimes get light, and sometimes dark. 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.480
 But, why the rolling effect? 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.160
 Well, before that 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.260
 we need to understand the rolling shutter in a camera. 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:40.460
 Or, in every modern camera. 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.600
 Old film cameras do not do this, 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.680
 logically, they only expose a picture to light 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.280
 every time a frame passes. 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.940
 But, no-no, not this. 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.940
 THIS camera, and all modern cameras 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.540
 walk, one line at a time, scrolling the screen along. 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.100
 This means that it can take a fraction of a second 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.720
 before the camera went from the top of the image to the bottom. 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.420
 The result is this rolling effect. 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.960
 Some of those lines were recorded when the light was fully on, 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.060
 and some lines were recorded when the light was dimmed. 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:08.160
 And that's the reason. 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.020
 That is why you are kind of weird, artificial, 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.680
 rolling light problem 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.260
 when you film in Europe with an American device. 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.340
 Of course, the easiest way to solve it is 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.040
 that Apple would have an option for 25 frames per second, 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.700
 but that would be much, too difficult for them ... 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.180
 And THAT is something you may not have known. 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.320
