00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.120
 In 2014, several YouTube celebrities were supervised by the UK’s advertising agencies. 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.890
 Point out that they are not clearly known for sponsoring content 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.990
 These people all mentioned sponsorship in the description of the film. 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.440
 Also at the end of the film, "Thanks to a certain company for making this happen." 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.280
 Nor is it sneaky, but these are still not enough. 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:22.240
 The rule is that you must clearly indicate that this is an advertisement before you click on the video. 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.240
 Why is this a problem in a world full of advertising? 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.810
 This is the case, the British media has one of the most stringent placement marketing laws in the world. 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:33.750
 What about the rest of the world? 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.050
 They don't care much. And the reason 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:38.780
 Like many things, the origins come from history. 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.859
 In the first few years of television 

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:48.030
 The only channel in the UK is the BBC broadcast by Alexandra Palace. Its source of income is not advertising 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.329
 It is the tax imposed on people who own television every year. Still so 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.640
 So advertising is not allowed on the BBC. 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:56.190
 This is the case in the past, and it is now. But in the US 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.469
 They have commercial TV from the beginning -- wow! 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.469
 A show host will interrupt the conversation from time to time. 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.610
 Recommend a better umbrella brand for the camera 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.370
 "Unless you smoke L&amp;M cigarettes, you can only imagine how wonderful it tastes." 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.430
 But in the UK, this is considered a very vulgar act. 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.950
 When commercial TV appears here 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.610
 Advertising magazine, weird half soap opera 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.120
 Half TV shopping has existed for several years 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.120
 But this is not the gameplay of the British, dear! 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.190
 So in the 1960s, strict rules were set: 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.490
 Ads and shows must be separated. No placement marketing is allowed. 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.440
 This has led to some strange phenomena that Americans find very strange. 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.840
 Like the British version of The Price is Right 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.460
 Can't mention the brand name 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.850
 You may win a brand new car! 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.370
 But the announcer won’t say which car it is. 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.090
 "A 1.3-litre hatchback" 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.770
 Phone shopping and TV shopping still exist today 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.430
 But they must have a clear indication 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.830
 On the screen, indicate its content 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.140
 Is there any suspicious black box operation behind the scenes? 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.360
 Are there some producers who have recovered the buckle? 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.700
 Let the protagonists of the TV series use a specific brand of computer? 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.540
 This is almost certain. But you won't see, say 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.670
 Those protagonists dine at a particular restaurant 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.749
 Then emphasize how delicious their food is. 

00:02:11.749 --> 00:02:13.900
 "This Subway sandwich is awesome!" 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.120
 Have you seen the American idol, the cups with the brand logo are placed in front of the judges? 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:21.129
 When the show is broadcast here, it has to be blurred on it. 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:22.900
 Other placement marketing, like in a movie 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.200
 Or in sports broadcasts, it is acceptable. 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.659
 But the supervisory authority takes a tough attitude toward the entertainment industry in the UK. 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:34.530
 This is the habit of people who grew up in the UK. 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.709
 This is also the standard that decision makers regard as television in this country. 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.230
 So you may be able to guess 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.400
 Our universal advertising regulations have a lot of restrictions. 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.749
 There is an Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) responsible for writing advertising rules. 

00:02:48.749 --> 00:02:51.790
 These rules are strictly voluntary 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.469
 But in fact it is almost the same as the law. 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:57.090
 Because few companies want to break the rules, so as not to attract negative images. 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.260
 No TV station or newspaper dares to play ads that violate the rules 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.159
 And the advertising agency, that is, the person who made the advertisement 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.980
 I don’t want to lick this drowning 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.629
 Because if it is not, then the government will set the rules. 

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.019
 Instead of the advertising industry 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.159
 And the government will impose penalties on those who violate the rules. 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:17.700
 Rather than just advertising the next thing so simple 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.569
 Recently, the rules have gradually relaxed. 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.109
 As long as there is a small pattern at the beginning of the show as a sign 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.790
 Some commercial TVs can now join placement marketing 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.889
 But for advertisers who are used to the US, 

00:03:30.889 --> 00:03:34.049
 Contemporary British TV is still an impact 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.079
 Ads cannot affect the content of the show 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:40.129
 And can't praise how good and good a certain product is. 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:44.159
 Can not be placed in the marketing of high-sugar, high-calorie, high-salt foods 

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:48.480
 And there is no admission marketing in the children’s program. 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.389
 ASA's office is in the building behind me. 

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.590
 And the rules they set are hundreds of pages, the rules for managing various advertisements. 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.959
 But there are two important chapters in it, which are very relevant to what we are talking about. 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:00.769
 Taking into account the regulations I just mentioned 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:02.469
 You probably won’t be too surprised 

00:04:02.469 --> 00:04:04.939
 First item: no matter where 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:07.849
 Ads must clearly indicate that they are ads 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:12.629
 Second item: Prohibition of advertising junk food to children 

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:17.819
 So you can probably understand why the supervisory authority has a video log master with a young audience. 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:22.669
 Dissatisfied with the promotion of biscuits without warning in their general films 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:24.060
 Fair point 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.379
 The supervisory authority did not provide assistance or advice to the industry for advertising. 

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:30.879
 At the beginning, a year and a half before I recorded this film. 

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:31.940
 They were scared to be caught off guard 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.580
 And the movie log owners are not expected to understand the rules. 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.979
 This should be an advertising agency -- that is, the person who hires the log owner -- 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.530
 Work to make sure they have rules 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.190
 Advertisers may be obsessed with this new, unrestricted platform. 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.530
 Or are they Americans, unclear or don't care about the rules? 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.069
 British television is still seen -- at least for the British -- the gold standard for television 

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:56.419
 We don't get those bad placement marketing 

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:59.360
 At least not on the TV. As for YouTube 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.250
 And the rest of the online world? 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:02.990
 The rules are still being written 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.550
 Speaking so much, I just want to say around the bend. 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.270
 My video is now open for sex marketing. 

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.949
 So if your company is interested, please feel free to contact us!
