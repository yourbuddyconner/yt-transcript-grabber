00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.659
 Throughout Britain, you will find this: Paving. 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.560
 It's to help the blind or the visually impaired find their way. 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.080
 Here's the smart part, 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.700
 And the part that almost all people with natural sight do not notice: 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.620
 There are different patterns of different situations. 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.710
 Very few people see nothing. 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.870
 This is important as saying. Only about 3%. 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.920
 Some people have a sense of light, some people have a slightly better vision. 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.940
 Some people have a limited field of vision. 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.119
 Some people have a weak central vision but a good peripheral vision. 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.440
 Simply put, you are thinking of people with partial eyesight and vision enough 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.130
 They must move with confidence and independence, 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.679
 The fact that the blind are less than that. 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.969
 No metal plate, like this, means a ramp to cross the road. 

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:45.530
 If it were red, or at least if it were supposed to be red, 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.570
 If it is a transit area with lights or something else to stop traffic: 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.639
 These designs for people with limited vision also, 

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:54.389
 So the bright contrasting color is a good idea. 

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:58.379
 There is a small amount of pave here, used as a sign, 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.030
 To locate the transit area. 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.499
 Near the road, it is along each transit area, 

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:03.979
 So you can know its place. 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:06.500
 It is important to balance the education of the transit area 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.450
 Against the non-use of paving touches excessive quantity: 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:13.010
 Because someone with arthritis will find cross surfaces like this painful. 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:19.130
 Moving in an unfamiliar area is always a little scary, to be frank. 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.600
 Because, certainly, traditional visual signs and road signs etc are not present. 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.030
 The fact that static tags help a lot, 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.210
 Therefore, there can be confusion when these conditions are not met. 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.020
 It is very important that these means exist to help us 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.799
 Be really to help us 

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.200
 They will exist the way we expect them. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.890
 But there are other patterns as well. 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.530
 Distant points mean that there is a train platform in front of you, a large gap can fall in. 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.460
 Oval shapes mean a tram platform, 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.149
 Something closer to the level of the street and can be crushed. 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.780
 Horizontal strips along the road mean that there are stairs in front of you, 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.909
 Or other things that can disturb you. 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.150
 Vertical strips along the road mean that the road of security is followed. 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.090
 Even if half the way to walk on foot and the other half for bicycles? 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.610
 If the direction of the tapes makes you able to differentiate between them. 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.360
 The administrative districts of London, the councils outside London, 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.300
 It seems to be moving more towards aesthetic considerations, 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:21.360
 Which means they are changing the color to dark gray so it is more compatible with the road. 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.170
 Of course if you agree more with the way, 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.320
 It is difficult for people with limited sight like me to see. 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:29.820
 Or in a more dangerous position, 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.220
 People can find themselves in the way, without knowing that they are in the way, 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.420
 Simply because these basic signs do not exist. 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.920
 Sure, it's hard to do everything right. 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.890
 The design measures for the application method are literally 100 pages long. 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:48.420
 But the same applies to the standards of design for anything related to infrastructure: 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.200
 Having reliable rules and understanding by all people is important 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.040
 When there are tons of metal rushing in front of you. 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.940
 Thank you very much to the Royal National Society for the Blind for all their help! 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:01.460
 You can take a look at their YouTube channel here, 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.200
 And yes, I've put a link to the 100-page design document at the bottom!
