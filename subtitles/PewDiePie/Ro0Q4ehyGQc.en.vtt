00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.040
 What is the most important thing you have in the galaxy 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.660
 Food or water .... 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.660
 No 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.660
 Internet 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.140
 I know you will want to know what my position is with the Internet 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.555
 I know you will want to know what my position is with the Internet 

00:00:14.555 --> 00:00:17.885
 Now I still do not have any Internet 

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:22.005
 So the wonderful people in the Oregon PC 

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.895
 They heard my voice ... They heard my voice to help 

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:26.000
 And MUDO to the hand of help 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.000
 I would like to send the origin cronos (computer) 

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.615
 Now I can move my equipment to a place with good internet 

00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:34.000
 Now the origin cronos are really good 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.700
 It 's the same size as Sony 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.865
 Look at this ... and this beast 

00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:42.500
 The 4K technology is spoken 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.500
 Let's be serious here. What is the most important thing after the Internet 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.000
 Computer 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.600
 Now it's likely that it will not take me 100 hours to upload a video 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.900
 Thank you (origin pc) I appreciate you 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.000
 But Felix (his real name) What do I mean? 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.000
 Oh ... I am I am I am here again 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.000
 Okay OK okay 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.000
 I'll make Jeff Oway for one ... okay? 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
 Just look at the link in the description 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.500
 The rules are simple .. just follow all the rules 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.900
 It is likely that you will use one like me 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 In the meantime, origin will also be sent to the origin millennium. Oh, he is a monster 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.000
 They told me they could put a special painting on it 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:19.000
 Tell me in the comments what type of painting they should give me 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.900
 The comment that wins the highest number of votes will win 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
 Also Geoff Awai all over the world so anyone can subscribe from anywhere in the world 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.000
 I really advise you to have a look at (originPC.com) 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.500
 You can play and design your own computer ... They are equipped with life support ... 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.900
 You buy this computer to accompany you throughout your life 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
 If you do not know what originals are ... Basically they are three managers from Alienware so they have tons of experiences to build awesome computers (Fajr Fashk) 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.000
 And I am really proud to have them as a sponsor of the channel .... 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.100
 Now let's go to the video 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
 Oh God .. I think we will play more 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.000
 I do not care if I fell the last time .. because this game is easy 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.455
 Stop ... stop ... we are close to the beginning of the game Do you bend! 

00:02:05.775 --> 00:02:09.000
 How far have you fallen? 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.005
 I have come back to the beginning 

00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:18.400
 I'm back to the beginning ... Are you serious! 

00:02:18.845 --> 00:02:21.275
 Oh my God .. I have to do everything again 

00:02:21.275 --> 00:02:25.685
 you know what ! It does not matter do you know why? Because I got strong movements now, my son 

00:02:25.685 --> 00:02:29.000
 No I care anymore! 

00:02:29.965 --> 00:02:31.065
 This is the easiest game .... 

00:02:31.555 --> 00:02:35.005
 View Profile 

00:02:35.145 --> 00:02:37.395
 I have tried so far 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.000
 Hehe 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
 I thought I would fall! 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.975
 Did you do ! 

00:02:45.285 --> 00:02:47.385
 How should I go up there, yell? 

00:02:47.925 --> 00:02:49.215
 I have a problem 

00:02:49.915 --> 00:02:52.735
 Just do what I did the first time Felix (his real name) ... but hey 

00:02:53.945 --> 00:02:56.215
 I know what to do 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.495
 Disadvantage .. No you can use the Ripper style 

00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:04.125
 You are shaking your head, yell 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.500
 No 

00:03:12.365 --> 00:03:13.695
 I want you to die 

00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:15.525
 I want you to die! 

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.025
 Yes, I'm fine ... I do not know ... 

00:03:35.455 --> 00:03:38.155
 If he was too zeky, why did he die? 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.895
 I started thinking I would die a terrible death 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.000
 Can this music relax? 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:52.400
 Oooh ... 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.415

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.000

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 Well done, he shouted 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.000
 Oh my God

00:04:27.045 --> 00:04:28.385
 Drag, yell 

00:04:29.155 --> 00:04:32.185
 Drag .. like the (say any hippocampus to a member) 

00:04:32.185 --> 00:04:34.565
 I will not call this game 

00:04:34.745 --> 00:04:37.655
 Well, it will not happen 

00:04:37.715 --> 00:04:39.925
 Yes, you are right 

00:04:39.925 --> 00:04:46.000
 You have made me die a million times ... I will return for another million (my love XD) 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:52.500
 This is a tricky phase ... You need a lot of energy. You need a lot of strength. You need more skill 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:57.845
 You need a lot of Christian YouTube channels .... Thank you I came back! 

00:04:58.545 --> 00:05:01.505

 To where we were before .... What do you think about this 

00:05:54.525 --> 00:05:57.945
 This is a tricky stage because you need a lot of interior 

00:05:58.255 --> 00:06:01.175

00:08:56.275 --> 00:08:58.985

00:08:58.985 --> 00:09:01.835
 Just do not fall across the hole and Felix will be okay 

00:09:01.835 --> 00:09:04.895
 You'll be okay ... Hi, look at me 

00:09:04.895 --> 00:09:05.895
 I think my sight was suspended 

00:09:06.465 --> 00:09:09.195

 Well I'm fine ... You're supposed to be my friend, hammer! 

00:09:18.015 --> 00:09:20.025
 Do not stand with me, old man 

00:09:22.155 --> 00:09:23.685
 What do you do ! 

00:09:24.905 --> 00:09:26.255

 Water slide is very annoying 

00:09:47.935 --> 00:09:51.025
 This was smooth 

00:09:51.025 --> 00:09:53.775
 This was as smooth as a balloon 

00:09:54.275 --> 00:09:57.435
 F. Felix Do you speak English with this language? 

00:10:01.335 --> 00:10:02.335
 Hahahaha 

00:10:02.405 --> 00:10:03.655

00:10:04.295 --> 00:10:05.295
 This 

00:10:05.475 --> 00:10:07.115
 Horrible 

00:10:08.885 --> 00:10:11.695
 This is really exciting because it looks nice 

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:14.415
 We are forced to go down ... all the surprise 

00:10:14.415 --> 00:10:17.485
 Because it is not a recurring thing in this game .. Oh God 

00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:20.795
 Well ok and now we just will 

00:10:22.875 --> 00:10:23.875
 Oh my God 

00:10:24.635 --> 00:10:27.875
 Adjust yourself, man, adjust yourself 

00:10:27.875 --> 00:10:28.985
 Adjust yourself 

00:10:35.945 --> 00:10:39.025
 We did it, you guys. Oh, that was easy 

00:10:39.025 --> 00:10:42.055
 O God .. what was difficult? !! 

00:10:42.055 --> 00:10:45.245
 Now I will do it 

00:10:45.565 --> 00:10:48.405
 It's a bad idea ... but if you were a coward 

00:10:48.405 --> 00:10:49.615
 Like me 

00:10:50.085 --> 00:10:52.195
 You will know the real power 

00:10:55.375 --> 00:10:58.375
 There is nothing wrong with it 

00:10:58.375 --> 00:11:01.535
 .. I am Bkhayer .. I am shy 

00:11:01.535 --> 00:11:04.535
 I'm fine I'm fine I'm fine 

00:11:04.535 --> 00:11:07.555
 Listen Listen I've almost gone back 

00:11:07.555 --> 00:11:10.625
 I almost went back to where I was 

00:11:10.735 --> 00:11:13.365
 No you will not ... oh Hassanna 

00:11:13.365 --> 00:11:16.325
 This kills me every time 

00:11:16.325 --> 00:11:19.305
 No do not fall down we discussed it 

00:11:22.605 --> 00:11:23.605
 No stops 

00:11:30.275 --> 00:11:31.465
 If that were difficult 

00:11:32.365 --> 00:11:35.485
 So how did you get back to work? 

00:11:35.485 --> 00:11:38.105
 As strong as possible 

00:11:38.105 --> 00:11:39.475
 Hey? Explain this 

00:11:42.725 --> 00:11:43.725
