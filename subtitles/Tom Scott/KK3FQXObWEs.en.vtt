00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.870
 I am still in the polar circle, so today's guest video was made by Collin Rodefer 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.700
 from the Collin Sphere Travel Vlog, he is in China. 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.950
 Pleasant to meet, my name is Collin and we are here in beautiful Shanghai, China. 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.650
 As a residence of tens of millions of people, 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.440
 Shanghai is one of the largest cities in the world. 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.869
 You may know some things you can do in Shanghai, 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.550
 such as the Bund, the Nanjing Lu, 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.609
 and even the new Disneyland. 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:24.269
 But despite the huge population, 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.060
 you might be surprised that here, in the city, 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.029
 a completely new villages are almost completely empty. 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.750
 Modern ghost towns. 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.650
 At the end of metro line 9 is Thames Town, 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.390
 a ghost town in English style, with street names like Prince and Harry Street. 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:44.330
 It is, as you can expect from a replica village with many statues 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:47.080
 from well-known people from English history and culture. 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:50.390
 This town was made to offer a place to the thriving municipality. 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.120
 And with shops that are "open", 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.790
 you have to look carefully before you realize that the fresh fruit, 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.280
 behind the windows, actually being fake 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.810
 and that these stores, in fact, are empty. 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.840
 When you meet people, 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.369
 you immediately see that this town is more of a tourist place, 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.659
 and even a background for wedding photos. 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.250
 Thames Town is one of the nine Western cities built in 2006 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.590
 on the outskirts of Shanghai. 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.889
 To absorb the hustle and bustle from the city center. 

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:20.011
 It would have cost Â¥ 5,000,000,000, 

00:01:20.011 --> 00:01:22.490
 and offers a residence for 10,000 people. 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.939
 The only goal was to house students and staff from the nine universities 

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.479
 from the nearby Sonjiang University city. 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.530
 As you might see, ten years later, 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.650
 that did not happen. 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.539
 After walking the perimeter of the place, 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:38.130
 what only one square kilometer country occupies, 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.359
 and seeing nothing but empty houses, 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:44.179
 I decided to try my luck and go to the center 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:47.170
 to see what to do in Thames Town 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.520
 on a summer evening at the weekend. 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.640
 Nothing. 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.530
 So why did this happen? 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.530
 Why did this fail? 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:54.530
 When the town was finished, 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.700
 the vast majority of the houses have been bought by wealthy investors and individuals 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.100
 to start business here and as a second home. 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.840
 And of course, if the demand rises, the price rises, 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.849
 and in this case the price shot up, 

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:08.850
 making it too expensive for universities to offer accommodation 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.290
 for their students and staff. 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.250
 So, with the majority of homes purchased, 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.610
 there are a lot of empty stores, and all stores 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.890
 try to serve 1,000 people 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.670
 while the population should be tenfold. 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:21.970
 If you think of a ghost town, 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.030
 You may think of old American cities that you often see in films 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.470
 with the well-known tumbler in the background. 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.340
 The difference between a town like that and this ghost town, 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.230
 is that there was once a community in those old cities 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.280
 and we now only have the remains of buildings 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.950
 - here everything is new and clean, and is just 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.360
 present. 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:44.560
 If you walk through this town, you will definitely get a creepy feeling, 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.450
 and it almost feels like the Truman Show, 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.650
 you know people live here, 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.000
 but it all feels a bit fake. 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.370
 I would say that is the best way to describe this 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.250
 is the feeling of a Hollywood set. 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.990
 But behind closed doors it does not feel like Hollywood, 

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.110
 and you get a totally different feeling. 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.570
 After some searching, I found a small cafe called Andy Coffee, 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.160
 and with counter counters and chairs thrown around, 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.300
 you get the feeling that the previous owner has just left. 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.530
 As if they had to flee quickly. 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.340
 At that moment I felt pretty paranoid, but afterwards, 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.840
 I should have sat there and made coffee for myself. 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.480
 The thought that I was trying to get rid of 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.820
 is that an actual community is where people really live, 

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.660
 instead of just a tourist attraction. 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.290
 And there are many reasons why this has been compared with the EPCOT center, 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.480
 and I have to remind myself that I can stay here for as long as I want. 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.120
 There is no closing time. 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.140
 It's pretty interesting here, and would I want to live here? 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:43.140
 Certainly. 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.150
 Certainly, if I could afford it. 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.010
 If you were to ask me how British really feels this place, 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.580
 I would say that, on every Chinese text on every street corner, 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.760
 and other things, such as bamboo scaffolding, 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:57.310
 it would be difficult to pinpoint the difference between Thames Town and a real English 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.310
 Place. 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.770
 Of course you can hardly go about the small details, 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.760
 like the windows that are a bit bigger, 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.420
 but that is simply the preference of Chinese culture. 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.990
 The middle way consists of the eternal love of tea, of the Chinese and British. 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.560
 Whether this place is a success or not is not my choice. 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.130
 And, despite the fact that the place does not meet its original purpose, 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.670
 the fact that the majority of the properties have been bought, 

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:21.650
 and the fact that China is building another city in Beijing, 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.840
 tells me they see something of value in these small western towns. 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:32.280
 Once again, I am Collin, and thank you for sharing this wonderful experience with me. 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.280
 Thank you, Collin! 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.280
 Subscribe to his channel, 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.560
 a link is in the description and on the screen. 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.190
 He has a lot of good videos like this. 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.800
 And what I like about this replica of London 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:45.380
 is that it has the same problem with rising house prices as real London. 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.650
 Next time, the last guest video, 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.370
 and it's about something you've probably seen and did not want to see.
