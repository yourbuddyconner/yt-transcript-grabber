00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.040
 Favorite on youtube 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.000
 Where he laughed jokes 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.540
 Or I do not think I'm laughing. I'm not supposed to laugh at jokes 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.180
 We are looking forward to a great time here 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.780
 Leave the admiration and follow up 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.540
 Here we begin 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.820
 No 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.580
 Come on 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.420
 He's a stupid tent man 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.660
 If I had a tent around me 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.460
 Literally you can urinate anywhere 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.900
 Why do you go to the bathroom this is not logical 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.520
 People say that this craziness is treating your dog as a mistake 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.660
 Do not criticize the dog 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.460
 The dog did nothing 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:13.060
 They criticized ... 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.300
 Water 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:28.900
 Yeah 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.380
 Children chant 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:31.540
 Ten points 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.580
 Ten points 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.820
 He broke his nose 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.040
 Twenty points 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.540
 He got my facial deformity forever and cosmetic surgery can not fix it 30 points 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.000
 Very beautiful 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.100
 I'm joking of course I hope it's fine 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.020
 I realized now that he could make a good smash joke 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.080
 Such as baby mode T 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.880
 For example, a fridge 1 or fridge 2 can be adjusted 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.020
 This will be good 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.080
 Baby mode T 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.740
 But of course he will not 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.580
 If Brad had edited it, he would say no and a black screen 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.980
 No 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.820
 If Saif did it would be very good 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.320
 Oh my God 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.180
 Hoover Board Baby T mode joins the game 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.840
 Or the third choice are connected and some say the word f 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.560
 Saif Lo wants to say anything he has left now 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:02.480
 Felix 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:06.960
 Hi everyone in India I am excited to see all the ant man and the wasp

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.400
 this is embarrassing 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:26.240
 Welcome to the Indian fans. I hope you listen to this. You laugh. You lose. I think you will love him. I hope to visit India soon. 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.660
 Welcome all fans in Slovakia ..... 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.960
 Maybe if I get out my tongue I'll get many leaks 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:36.940
 does not work 

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.720
 To see if it succeeded 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.660
 Nice 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.220
 you know.. 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:52.220
 Praise be to God 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:54.260
 Praise be to God... 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.760
 There was no social interaction before YouTube 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.700
 It is because I have become less provocative 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.440
 But, man, this is the right of the world 

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.060
 I can not see more I'm sorry 

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.920
 Physical pain 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:33.960
 A song for Mayncraft 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.660
 To be fair it's a wonderful song 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.060
 (I was quite alone) I did not watch this movie 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:47.200
 (Almost completely alone) I feel I need to watch it 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.840
 The loans are worth it 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.840
 Good joke 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.660
 Good joke all you get 2 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:00.060
 This is not a meme review 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:06.660
 Oh my God 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.600
 Is this Despacito 2 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.160
 Is it legal to kill the two hairs because they are alive? 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:17.800
 I'm not saying you should just be curious 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:28.060
 Yeah 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.300
 Best rendering in the world 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.540
 Damn 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.960
 I understand the real Peter Griffin and Fortnight also irritate me 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.580
 This can be me in a second world 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.940
 Yup 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:06.000
 Yup 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:10.400
 It must be stronger than God's great forgiveness 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:13.560
 To get this 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:17.140
 Know that you can do it by raising your thumb 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:21.680
 This is enough for this video 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.300
 He is waiting for you in terms of not learning 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.440
 This is enough for this video 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.880
 It's so easy to make YouTube videos 

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:41.500
 This is enough for this video 

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.260
 It's a way of telling her 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:47.220
 This is enough for this video 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:50.940
 I hope you would like to subscribe to more ice cream in Zori 

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.480

00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.880
 Thanks Kane 

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.100
 Very cool 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.220
 Why this is a joke 

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:39.940
 Let's listen to this without music 

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:05.020
 I do not know why this is so funny 

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.440
 I want more of this joke 

00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:21.480
 Yup 

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:27.700
 Well this is awesome 

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.320
 Why this joke is pervasive all over the place 

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.760
 I need to play it 

00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:50.040
 He explains why fnaf is very famous 

00:09:51.280 --> 00:09:54.960
 It's not fun in the first few minutes 

00:09:56.820 --> 00:09:58.820
 When you start to understand it, it's just a bite 

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:03.180
 Made just to scare you 

00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:09.020
 The cheapest way to scare one is because it is easy but effective 

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.100
 Who will come out 

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:14.640
 Damn 

00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:20.020
 This was good 

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:26.140
 We're sure we will not get better videos than this so we'll finish the video 

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000
 thanks for watching 

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.060
 This is enough for this video 

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:40.680
