00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.839
 The Voyager 1 spacecraft is the most distant artificial object of the earth, and the fastest. 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:07.920
 But at the moment it is moving towards us. 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.530
 Relatively speaking. 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:12.719
 This is the control room for NASA's Deep Space Network. 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.810
 And the scientists here still listen to the signals sent by Voyager. 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.250
 Deep Space Network is a collection of antennas all over the world 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.580
 that we use to track deep space missions. 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.220
 We provide commands for the spacecraft, "turn left at the next bend" 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:29.220
 Those things, for example, 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.500
 a little bit more complicated than that. 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.000
 Turn on the instruments, turn off the instruments, software updates. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.200
 The most important reason for sending the thing into space 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.530
 is to get the scientific data back. And so the instruments take pictures, 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.540
 infrared photos and measure the Voyager different particles. 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.890
 We need that data and to distribute it to the scientists. 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.940
 The Deep Space Network's 3 stations cover the entire sky. 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.840
 Each mission more than 30,000 kilometers away from Earth 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.690
 is visible to at least one station, at all times. 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.940
 Geostationary orbit, where we hold the most communication satellites 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.100
 is further away than that. 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.620
 We only have three branches all over the world. 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:10.050
 Madrid in Spain, Goldstone here in California and the Canberra branch in Australia. 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.130
 Usually we do not follow things that go over the pool 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.730
 because the type of missions that we do in deep space 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:17.950
 are usually in the ecliptic. 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.720
 If you look at the solar system, where the sun is 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.000
 and where the planets are that move around the sun 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.770
 they all seem to be in a flat plane. 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.050
 That launch across the plane of the solar system, over the ecliptic 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.740
 is the reason that Voyager is currently coming closer to earth. 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.770
 Yes, Voyager always moves away from the sun, but sometimes the earth's orbit means 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.070
 that we are going in the same direction, only faster. 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.120
 So we come closer. 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.180
 Of course we are drawn back into our elliptical orbit again 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.350
 so that it will be smoothed if we go the other way. 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.400
 Regarding the control of spacecraft, I think for example with Voyager, 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.479
 probably downlink every day 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.210
 because again, there is a lot of good data, but if it comes with 160 bits per second, 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.480
 it takes a long time to retrieve that data from the spacecraft. 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.260
 The signal must in a sense be above the noise level for us to see it. 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.530
 In the first place we try to filter out the noise as much as possible 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.890
 from a frequency point of view. 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.260
 My signal takes this bit of spectrum in frequency. 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.500
 I do not want more noise than what is there. 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.010
 I want to correlate the signal that comes down 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.100
 with what I think the signal looks like. 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.930
 You have to take advantage of what you know about the signal 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:29.850
 and use these characteristics as well as possible to filter out the noise. 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.610
 Voyager 1 carries radioisotope thermogenerators, RTGs. 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.920
 They are driven by radioactive decay. 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.680
 And there is enough power to make it last until about 2025. 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.819
 Then the vessel will go dark, and carry a message forward in the interstellar space 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.040
 for ... well, we do not know where, or when, or even who. 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.400
 When enough light is reflected off, 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.819
 you would be able to see it with a telescope, but it is so far away, and so weak, 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.830
 without any radio signal coming from Voyager, 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.600
 there is no way that we, the DSN, could follow it. 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.380
 And so I think that's the end when it gets dark. 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.620
 Thank you to the whole team at NASA, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.260
 and here at the Deep Space Network. 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.680
 Look at the description for more about them, and about their missions.
