00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.949
 These are solar power towers in southern Spain. 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:05.129
 We are located in one of the sunniest parts of Europe 

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:07.919
 and these two towers were the first of their kind. 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.900
 Almost 2,000 heliostats, moving mirrors, 

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.990
 constantly reflecting the sun's rays on these towers, converting water into steam, 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.070
 driving a turbine that generates electricity. 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.470
 And if you look at the internet, 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.470
 you will see quite a few documents mapping this area, 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.430
 people who were incredibly impressed with this technology 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.170
 and sell it what the future of electricity production. 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.550
 And these towers are impressive. 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.630
 Not only visually, 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.360
 but the technology behind this project is very smart and very simple: 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.329
 It's the same as to bother your teacher's reflections of the sun from your cell phone, 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.899
 only on a much larger scale. 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.280
 But it has a hook. 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.429
 When this project was built, Spain was booming 

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:44.640
 and heavily subsidized solar energy. 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.170
 Investors liked it and invested in piles of money themselves, 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.270
 companies and researchers were glad to be able to build different buildings like these 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:58.080
 and suddenly, the Spanish government had far more solar energy than she had planned ... 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:00.380
 having to subsidize all these projects. 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.390
 Then came the economic crisis. 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.260
 The Spanish government stopped the subsidy program. 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.260
 Not only for future projects, 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.840
 not only for power stations already under construction, 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.060
 but even for all power plants that have already been built 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:12.840
 on the assumption that the cessation of the subsidy program will offset its budget. 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.660
 The solar industry shook it: Spain changed the original deal 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.280
 and all solar societies could only pray that the government would not change these agreements again in the future. 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.120
 Or she has declared bankruptcy, one of them. 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.360
 This project could still be viable, perhaps, 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.890
 along with further research and development 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.770
 and that's exactly what he is trying to do now. 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.060
 But beware, the price of ordinary, 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.180
 of ordinary solar panels is still falling. 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:32.700
 Not mirrors such as these, 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.040
 just ordinary solar panels, the same as those you can attach to your house 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.460
 or as those used on large solar farms, 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.550
 directly transforming sunlight into electricity. 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.220
 Whether the price of these panels will drop 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.700
 it depends on which team of scientists you will trust, 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.830
 but they are now cheaper than the construction of the giant towers, 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.240
 filled with high pressure water or molten salt to heat them 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.390
 and struggling with a thousand movable parts that must all copy the position of the sun, 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.390
 perfectly, 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.420
 and which can exceptionally also bite birds in flight. 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.030
 Do not get me wrong. Paper is a great technology. 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.490
 Combines renewable resources with storage: 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.390
 if you heat, for example, molten salt, 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.370
 you can save this energy for several hours and use it during the night. 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.629
 And other power plants like these are under construction: 

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.530
 one, almost finished, in the Atakama desert, South America. 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.090
 But right now, 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.090
 this technology is expensive. 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.090
 Maybe she did not have to be, 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.310
 if history were going in a different direction, 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.700
 if the development was dealt with by these towers instead of traditional solar panels: But so far, 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.879
 that the future will not be so bright.
