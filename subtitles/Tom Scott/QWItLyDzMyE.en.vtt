00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.150
 I'm in Crystal Palace Park, south of London, and there are dinosaurs. 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.400
 Well, dinosaur models. And models not at all precise: 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.019
 but that's because they are more than 150 years old. 

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.749
 These were the first models of extinct creatures never made, 

00:00:15.749 --> 00:00:18.000
 Built by the gardens of the huge Crystal Palace 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.750
 which was previously on that hill there. 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.460
 They were made by the spectacularly named Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins. 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.810
 Today we know that they are terribly incorrect in many significant aspects, 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.850
 but then they were a wonder: 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.580
 "Look at what the Earth once inhabited!" 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.540
 Currently, in England there is a list of buildings that have special protection under law. 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.410
 The buildings on this list are called ... Buildings Listed. 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.120
 Because they are on the list. 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.280
 Of buildings 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.760
 And this country is full: Historic England, 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.640
 the not very governmental organization that manages the list, 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.370
 He says that there is well half a million. 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.920
 Most of the buildings are only listed as Grade 2, 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.630
 which means that they should be kept intact 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.640
 and any change that you want to do needs a very good reason, 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.390
 but more than 10,000 sites are listed as Grade 1, 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.219
 which means that they must be preserved. 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:07.499
 Basically everything that was built more than 200 years ago and still hard is on the list, 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.780
 but there are also some more modern things ... like these dinosaurs. 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:17.110
 Yes sir Dinosaurios de Grado 1 en la lista. They can not be changed, moved or overthrown. 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.369
 They must be kept in good condition, 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.780
 and they can not be updated to reflect what paleontologists today know, 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.360
 because that would mean changing them, 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.600
 and destroy not an exhibition of dinosaurs, 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.170
 but an exhibition of how we once thought we were the dinosaurs. 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.200
 Something that is not important for what it represents in itself, 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.240
 but for the history included in these sculptures. 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.650
 These dinosaurs, by law, must remain incorrect 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.689
 because the story they tell is not from prehistoric times ... 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.400
 It's about science, just 150 years ago. 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:53.290
 I have made a video with Minute Earth on Null Island, 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.040
 the busiest place that does not exist. 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.290
 You can take a look at your channel. 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.300
