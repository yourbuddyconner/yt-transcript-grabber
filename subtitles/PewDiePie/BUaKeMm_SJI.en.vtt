 Naughty 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 Nie will lose 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.500
 The rules are as simple as this 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.020
 Keep me up to date! 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.640
 You are still having a cold meal there, Felix? How many times do you have to fry? 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.480
 How many Laozis do how hot! 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:31.900
 let's start 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.320
 let us 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:34.780
 let's start 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.980
 Dad pulls out! 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.000
 Dad pull 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.480
 YESSSSSSSS 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.080
 Another classic loud voice is a funny idiot demonstration 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.280
 Just 4 loud! Hahaha 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:51.700
 Two ounces (=56g) of vodka 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.020
 after that... 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.200
 Is this true? XD? 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.360
 Two ounces of vodka 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.960
 By the waist this is really XDDD 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.180
 It doesn't matter, I think this should be taken as the benchmark for Russia's daily life. 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.840
 So I think this is quite normal, so it’s not funny. 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:17.400
 we 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.660
 Never~~ 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.500
 Surrender RRRRRRRRRR 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.520
 That smug smile wwww 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.200
 we 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.300
 Never~~ 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.860
 Surrender RRRRRRRR 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.980
 That is a beautiful smile, how did he do it? 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.200
 Nose hair! 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.340
 Ok, DER, we don’t want to bend around. 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.960
 This anime is really pretty good at the moment and it has quite potential 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.920
 I also hope that it will not be like the previous A-1 Pictures tradition that we hoped for. 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.220
 Translator: This is the treasure of Long Niang's seven seven seven burial. 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.300
 I know these works欸

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.460
 How many episodes does this have? Oh, very good. 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.220
 Hot, I am more interested in this part. 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.920
 Hey! This is a good meeting. 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.620
 Dream Heart 2 (PSO2) 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.680
 Terraria 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.920
 Iron fist series 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.660
 OK 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.080
 Wait, how did you get the combo off? 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.640
 You are just a landlord + home 蹲

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.220
 You eat pudding and play games all day long. 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.680
 Then you hit me three times and gave me this combo? 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.180
 No, I don’t want to hear you explain you. 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.760
 2 quick combos and 1 counterattack to let the enemy fall to the ground 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.320
 And you have two consecutive combos and then slammed 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.360
 Will only cause minor injuries 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.200
 Mishima 18 is a super good connection skill欸

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.520
 Then you use this role to give me a combo like this? 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:44.220
 Then this is three small? Knock on the floor? 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.140
 Then she gave me a roll on the ground. 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.040
 Are you just madly pressing the squares and triangles? 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.840
 You fucking DSP 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.400
 Awesome 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:57.220
 I don’t know where it’s good. 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.160
 Really, I am looking forward to this part when I look at the front. 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.840
 Now I don't know what to think about. 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:07.360
喔喔~ It sounds like an egg fox 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.280
 The fox fox always likes to steal our stuff. 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.440
 If you see the fox... 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.660
 Then call your avatar! 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:18.900
 Euler, Ola, Oula, Ola, Ola, Oula, Eurasian 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.080
 Oh my god 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.460
 Seek the full version! Please, please! 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.280
 This is really amazing! 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.600
 Hey, I have seen this. 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.860
 Why are they falling all the time? 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:38.640
 Why is it down? 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.300
 Is this a acting or is it? 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.520
 Why do they have to fall down all the time! 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.440
 Don't fall down again!!!!! 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.240
 This is the thing I watch most often. 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.520
 This fucking is strange enough 

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.480
 Look at your beach without a lifeguard 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.220
 I am not at the beach, I am in the bathtub! 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.740
 This acting is great enough DER 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.200
 I think it’s Tommy Wiseau’s role as a screenwriter. 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.440
 I am not at the beach, I am in the bathtub! 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.480
 Miss, please, please. 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.740
 I saw that there is no lifeguard on your beach. 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:10.380
 I am not at the beach, I am in the bathtub! 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.460
 I am not at the beach, I am in the bathtub!! 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.380
 No lifeguards are not safe in the water 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.780
 Miss is only 2 feet (60 cm) deep. 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.080
 You can relax 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.300
 You are safe now, your lifeguard is here 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:33.060
 OK... 

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.760
 *哔* 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:44.120
 There are sharks coming out of the water! 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.820
 What? Shark? 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:45.660
 Come out from the water 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:46.260
 shark? 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.180
 There are sharks in the water 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.700
 No sharks in the bathtub 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:51.860
 Wait 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.980
 There will be no sharks in the bathtub. 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.160
 I think you are playing me. 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.640
 Do you feel very happy, there are lifeguards to save you? 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.820
 I guess 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.760
 What are you waiting for? 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:10.760
 This is really amazing enough, ww, I don't understand. 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.200
 What happened in the end w 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:13.720
 What happened there~ 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.160
 Parking a fucking give me fucking parking 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:19.580
 Thank you very much for your monitoring. 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.980
 Do you fucking or not understand people? 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.160
 Hui 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.740
 How are we fucking so far? 

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.100
 Bad, no oil 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:30.540
 No~ 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.200
嘿~(超小声) 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.640
 Oh~ this guy is really wwwww 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:42.620
 Bad, no oil 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.460
 No~ 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.480
 I like that noise! 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.420
嘿~~~~ 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.180
 Oh~ This is really great, right? 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:54.700
 (How to make a game) 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.520
 (Load the last game map .exe) 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.440
 (Replace the last new map. cum) 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:01.140
 (copy) 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:09.220
 I think this is what they want to say how to make a game. 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.260
 (DLC) 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:19.780
 Hey! If you want a full game, just buy me DLC. 

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:21.760
 Don't be stingy. 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.740
 Let's take a small piece of ww from it. 

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:38.400
 (pre-purchase bonus) 

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.860
 Oh~wow 

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:43.820
 All that has been done for us is awesome 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:46.160
 Master masterpiece 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:48.060
 Um, this is very beautiful. 

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:49.460
 I will say that I am doing well. 

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:55.440
 Do I seem to know what is JEPG (image distortion)?%$#^%H%T^&amp;^% 

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:59.940
 This almost made me laugh and did a good job. 

00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:05.740
 Do I seem to know what is JEPG?%$#^%H%T^&amp;^% 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:09.360
 This is fundamentally w is not funny w 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:14.500
 Do I seem to know what is JEPG?%$#^%H%T^&amp;^% 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.040
 Hey... the fun place about this game is 

00:07:20.040 --> 00:07:22.440
 You can draw the second child 

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:25.300
 Use the amplitude produced by your voice 

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:27.000
 This is really hard 

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.840
 This GG is not bad 

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.340
 Yes~ Tiana 

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:42.860
 I must try this. 

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:44.980
 I must try this ok 

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.160
 Not ~ dry 

00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.240
 Ok, this is the ugly chicken. 

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.460
 Let me try again 

00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:06.640
 dry 

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.000
 This is hard enough 

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:18.220
 This is actually not bad. 

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.180
 I feel that I am getting better. 

00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:28.340
 dry 

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.120
 I knew I knew it! 

00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.980
 I know that I have this talent in front of it that is perfect. 

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.680
 My old swan 

00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.120
 I know that I am really talented. 

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:55.420
 This is this! 

00:08:55.420 --> 00:08:57.520
 I saw that there is no lifeguard on your beach. 

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:02.260
 I am not at the beach, I am in the bathtub. 

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:06.080
 No lifeguards are not safe in the water 

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:07.120
 Not so funny at all 

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.120
 This is another episode where you laugh and lose..... 

00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:14.240
 I hope that you have enjoyed this episode as usual. 

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:19.700

 I am looking very tired of myself. 

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:38.320
 I don't want to do the work of these fucking exhausted people. 

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.500
 thank you 

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:40.840
 I hate that I hate doing this. 

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.080
 But if you think these are not funny 

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:44.480
 Then you come to prove that I am wrong. 

00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.080
 Come and send me those really funny things ok? 

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:51.200
