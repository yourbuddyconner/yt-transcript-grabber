00:00:00.096 --> 00:00:03.182
 The old saying says the snow is too cold. 

00:00:03.301 --> 00:00:07.584
 A lot of people will surely say that it's silly and that it can snow at any temperature. 

00:00:07.703 --> 00:00:09.976
 That's a little true. 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.895
 Let's start with some technical details. 

00:00:13.074 --> 00:00:16.041
 We're talking about snow made of water. 

00:00:16.232 --> 00:00:20.036
 I'm not talking about methane snow on Titan or on another planet. 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.105
 A cryogenic temperature, 

00:00:22.321 --> 00:00:25.694
 in which liquid oxygen and nitrogen, 

00:00:25.861 --> 00:00:30.203
 they are too low on snow if you do not have strange ideas about snow. 

00:00:30.317 --> 00:00:34.240
 We talk about common ground snow from frozen water, 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.752
 which has just begun to fall here. 

00:00:36.938 --> 00:00:41.531
 The colder the air, the less water vapors it can keep. 

00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:43.942
 Satisfy faster. 

00:00:44.076 --> 00:00:47.119
 When it is cold, the individual molecules of water 

00:00:47.248 --> 00:00:51.038
 have a better chance of condensing into the fluid 

00:00:51.153 --> 00:00:54.803
 and a much lesser chance of evaporation. 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:59.406
 The cold air is more likely to get rid of the water 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.086
 and had formed clouds before. 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.220
 Cold air is drier. 

00:01:04.315 --> 00:01:06.913
 It is too cold to snow. 

00:01:07.162 --> 00:01:09.976
 But a few other facts need to be taken into account. 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.712
 The temperature down here, although it's cold, is not the same as above. 

00:01:14.818 --> 00:01:16.368
 There is much bigger winter above. 

00:01:16.502 --> 00:01:18.896
 But sometimes the warmer air is above the cooler. 

00:01:18.926 --> 00:01:21.063
 The fact that there is cold and dry air, 

00:01:21.178 --> 00:01:24.316
 does not mean that ice crystals are not formed in the clouds. 

00:01:24.651 --> 00:01:27.522
 Of course, only if the clouds are there. 

00:01:27.618 --> 00:01:29.010
 That's another problem. 

00:01:29.106 --> 00:01:33.469
 Keep in mind that snow can only form in clouds. 

00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:38.455
 The clouds also reflect the heat coming out of the surface of the Earth back. 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.742
 If you do not see the clouds, it will not snow. 

00:01:40.972 --> 00:01:45.847
 It will also be much cooler because the clouds do not reflect heat. 

00:01:46.077 --> 00:01:51.541
 So this saying is not entirely true, but here you can see how it was created. 

00:01:51.804 --> 00:01:54.594
 Yes, when the temperature drops and falls, 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.785
 it is for these reasons that snowing is less and less likely. 

00:01:58.903 --> 00:02:01.060
 That is the part of truth. 

00:02:01.214 --> 00:02:03.950
 It can be too cold to snow. 

00:02:04.046 --> 00:02:08.405
 Right now there's a really big winter and I'm going back inside. 

00:02:09.907 --> 00:02:11.362
 I got it behind my neck! 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:15.496
