 I am standing on top of a hill, and like six thousand other hills in high places in Britain, 

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:11.300
 has this one on top of it. A small squat pillar, made of concrete, about 3 feet high. 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:16.980
 Why would anyone make the effort to build six thousand of these weird things known as "triangle points," 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.580
 Trigonometry stations, on high points, because it is very complicated to get here, you have to poke tools 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:25.540
 you have to lift the cement here, and you build something there, most likely 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.640
 will continue to stand for centuries. Why would you do that? 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:35.880
 The answer is mapping. In 1936, and continuing for another quarter of a century, Brigadier Martin Hotine 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.880
 and thousands of other people who worked for the Ordnance Survey built these pillars in an effort to re-map Great Britain with trigonometry, 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.680
 and thus creating the first real accurate map of let country 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.160
 Look, distance is terribly difficult to measure. But you can measure angles, angles very precisely. 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.660
 On top of that you have some hooks where you can put a 'theodolite' on, something with which you can measure angles. 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:04.060
 And then you build them on these hills, so that at whatever triangular point you are, 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:09.640
 you can see at least two other triangle points. And if you can, and you know how goniometry works from high school, 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.940
 then you can go over one heather somewhere with the angles you have measured with one pre-arranged baseline 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.720
 measure all distances in Great Britain. 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.800
 Today, GPS has taken over, of course, and they are not much more than a milestone for hikers 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.880
 but still, these triangular points meant that we had made a preziese map of Great Britain, 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.640
 with nothing but a lot of angles and a lot of math.
