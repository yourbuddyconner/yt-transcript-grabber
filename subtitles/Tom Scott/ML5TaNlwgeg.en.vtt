00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
I'm on the Swanscombe peninsula, a few miles east of London,

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.340
on the south bank of the Thames.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.240
And this is notable for a couple of reasons

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.980
I mean, it just looks like a desolate brownfield site

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:09.900
and I guess it is.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.860
But it's also the warmest point in the UK.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.740
Officially. Seriously. I mean, not right now; it's the middle of December,

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.180
but all the record temperatures that have ever been recorded in the UK,

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:22.320
the famous 38°C, 101°F,

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.800
that was once recorded came from that weather station behind me.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.700
It's an official Met Office weather station.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.060
If you have a look online,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.900
you'll see that meteorologists are having a bit of a debate about it.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.260
Weather stations like that,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.240
the official ones, behind a Stevenson screen, as they're called,

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.020
are meant to filter out any kind of external influence.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:40.980
They're not meant to be in the middle of a microclimate

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.340
for proper temperature records.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.620
Well, there's some debate that this is.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.860
It's surrounded by earth on three sides,

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.000
there's industrial activity, docks, and a sewage plant,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.760
all of which could raise the temperature.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.700
And, well, there's a Port of London Authority radar next to it,

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.940
and if you believe the conspiracy theorists online,

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.880
and say "They've caught the Met Office in a lie,

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.220
that radar could be warming up the sensors"

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.960
Obviously, it's not, but, nevertheless

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.580
there's some question as to whether this is actually the warmest site

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.360
in Gravesend, as it's known.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.240
Or, whether they've just put the weather station in a slightly wrong place.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.840
But there's something more important about this site.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.520
This whole area, this whole peninsula,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.280
it doesn't look big on a map

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.860
but I've just spent a muddy mile and a bit walking here, and

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.460
yeah... it's big, because this will be the site,

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.960
if all goes well, of the coming Paramount London theme park,

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.640
the one that, this week, announced it's signed a deal with the BBC

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.280
in order to license Top Gear, Doctor Who,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.120
and a load of other TV shows.

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.860
So, in 5-6 years' time,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.000
I might be walking down here on a nicely paved path,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.220
with people screaming as they ride rollercoasters

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.020
and laughing as they have a go on the TARDIS.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.340
It's going to be quite different in 5 or 6 years' time

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.300
if it all goes well, and this weather station

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.660
will probably have to be moved.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.700
So, if the temperature in London seems to drop officially in a few years' time,

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.740
perhaps it has,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.480
or, more likely, perhaps they've moved this weather station

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.240
to make way for The Doctor.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.240
