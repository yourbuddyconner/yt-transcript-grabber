00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:23.040
 * Hey Monika * 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.940
 Yup 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.840
 It's time for another week of 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:28.660
 لوووااايييي (shortcut to Joomla in the last week I asked you) 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.940
 I saw the things you gave 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.840
 Your content 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.660
 And I have questions 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:37.740
 Fill the lead !! 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.580
 Let's see what you've published this week 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.700
 I think if there is any 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:52.640
 Mames regarding the chair 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.540
 And yes you recently 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:56.260
 Yes, I recently got out of prison 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.640
 You are right!! 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.740
 Who will win ?? !! 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:00.380
 I have a better graphics system 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.560
 But can you do this ?? 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.040
 * Raya * 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.700
 We barely started 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.520
 Logan Paul publishes video .. The body of a dead man appears 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.720
 YouTube puts it in its common rules 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.000
 Biodepay posted a video response of 15 seconds 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.360
 Who does not show any body! ... violates our Terms of Service 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.460
 I will not ask YouTube 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.320
 To save them ... 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.920
 Biased 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.840
 While in fact 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.120
 People are re-publishing the Logon Paul video 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.980
 Their videos have been deleted 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:35.000
 And reporting 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.080
 One stroke, however 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.680
 Logon Ball video has been approved 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.540
 And has no specific age 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.520
 This is not bias 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.020
 This is just ... Ummm ... 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.200
 The... 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.560
 Aa ... 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.680
 just me... 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.440
 I'm just happy that YouTube keeps you ... Umm .. you know .. 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.920
 The same rules for all ... 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:52.840
 That's logical ... 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:53.740
 Sounds fair to me 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.500
 I 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:55.020
 Certain 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.580
 Logon Paul, "Mystery" 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.480
 It will be canceled as my program has been canceled. 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:00.680
 With that 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.060
 Media attention comes 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.180
 Someone touched my idea ... 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.500
 Although I have seen these mimics (sarcastic) in many times 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.280
 In many places, I have seen in 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.980
 Twitter 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.940
 Someone touched my spaghetti !! 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.560
 Someone touched my spaghetti !! 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.460
 I'm laughing 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.320
 You lose 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:31.600
 You just can not hold yourself 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.300
 I have to admit ... that Mimaz is really wonderful 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:34.360
 You are a group you learn 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.820
 And you improve 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.800
 Such as artificial intelligence 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.700
 You can learn well 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:41.560
 My heart is resting 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.120
 an exercise... 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.120
 When someone touches your spaghetti .. 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.640
 I bear all the terrible things to become in life 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.640
 sexual harassment 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.680
 killing... 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.940
 But when someone touches your spaghetti ... 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.940
 Here you have to stand and use your voice 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.120
 Someone touched my spaghetti !! 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:07.500
 Ethan and Post have done it before you ... 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.880
 Curse.. 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.900
 Oooh really ... but can you do this ??? 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.400
 Haha .. I do not think this !! 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.040
 Learn the difference ... 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.220
 This chair is highly qualified 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.900
 Chair with $ 399 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.900
 How much you pay for your purchases from Apple 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.920
 Surprisingly this wonderful chair is inexpensive? 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:33.920
 is not it?? 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.080
 O hypocrites 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.260
 Duki Duki from Real Life 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.500
 She opened the door quietly 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.940
 No 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.080
 I feel that we will see these mimics (sarcastic image) for a long time 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.040
 2018 is a good start to ... oh .. the door rings .. 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.440
 ... 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.680
 Excuse me until I open the door 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.900
 I do not need it now 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.300
 Hi ... I explain this, YouTube 

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.780
 Why do you touch my spaghetti ?? 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.780
 The reason for this is 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.240
 that's cool.. 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.720
 I loved the design so I painted my nails with the same design 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.120
 Really wonderful 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:30.120
 You know .. it is a high quality design 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.300
 By Beyodipaye (meaning himself) 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.580
 Do you see a chair? 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.580
 ... 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.580
 It's 399 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.900
 you're welcome 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:44.500
 If Felix and Marzia (his girlfriend) did not agree, I think I found the right girl for the bodibay 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.020
 Why 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:49.020
 For she has a hammer, O congregation 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.760
 Wonderful 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.760
 It's definitely Brad 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.680
 How to Speak with Short People 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.040
 Right 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.040
 Hi Marzia (girlfriend) I want to talk to you (meaning it's short) 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:07.160
 Note that you are in the middle of the video and you do not know what to talk about because you are looking at the LED light for seven minutes continuously 

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:15.260
 It's good to know that my channel is full of intellectuals 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.540
 Who are not only distracted by flashing lights 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:22.040
 I'm trying to post a good message for 2017 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.800
 And you "Oh see! Shine!" 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.300
 who will win 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.300
 A broad boy 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.300
 Or a long boy 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:30.520
 Oh really 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:32.780
 But can a broad boy do this? 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:40.860
 I hope that one day my back will break and this will be the last video 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:42.200
 on the Internet 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.060
 Well, we have a lot more important 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.800
 Someone touched the spaghetti 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:56.160
 Yeah 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.220
 You know what, I can do it if you want 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.720
 I won a people's medal in 2017 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.940
 Number six in the most sought after 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.900
 Awa Gifts 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.620
 Number seven on twenty ??????? 

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:16.740
 The most popular 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:18.400
 This is true, group 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.640
 YouTube's favorite program is confirmed 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.640
 Luwaiyi Luwaiaye 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:23.660
 Much better than YIAY 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:24.540
 In any case 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:27.860
 I can not even say it because it's a bad name 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.040
 I do not know how you came up with a terrible name that is not authentic 

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:35.580
 Loi is the undisputed hero 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.420
 Thanks 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:40.680
 I do not feel comfortable when I let other people do things to me so far 

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.740
 Achieves billions and millions by letting fans do their work 

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.520
 Does not modify its videos 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:50.280
 Imagine killing yourself and Logon Paul is the one who finds your body 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:52.280
 I will kill myself again 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.360
 But can you do this ?? 

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.760
 this is good 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.820
 But can you do this ?? 

00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.240
 Beat it well 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.080
 Beat it well 

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:20.600
 Anytime you lose a discussion in anything 

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:27.340
 If I realize - damn - I will definitely use my Trump card. can you do this?? 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:29.340
 Good joking jokes 

00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:31.600
 Someone hang himself, I was very sad about it 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:35.400
 But the total views in my channel increased 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.880
 Mimiz! Their taste is delicious! 

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:46.880
 Like .. Spaghett someone! 

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:54.620
 When you go from being the most hated Utopar in the Internet to the 2 most hated Utopar in the Internet 

00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:00.080
 Spaghetti !!! 

00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:03.500
 Men, women, disabled, Biodepay

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:37.240
 Someone touched spaghetti !! 

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:39.240
 I learned that 

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.400
 Does anyone else learn math in elementary school? 

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:45.800
 We had these special kids in the classroom 

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:52.100
 I respect the ladies after all that is a nice person in Yodebay, of course of course 

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.240
 I am a nice little boy 

00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:00.900
 I am one of the top 10 nice ones if there is a list of 10 nice boidebay kids I will be in the first 10 

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.800

 Curse 

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:12.980
 Not the hell 

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:15.900
 This is a true Christian Christian content 

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:16.540
 Yeah 

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:18.480
 YouTube rules are not broken 

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:18.980
 No 

00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:21.800
 If published, he will not be deprived of the value of the official payment 

00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.100
 This is my logic 

00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:24.680
 Publish 

00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:25.820
 Denial of official payment values 

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:29.140
 Yeah! Yeah! Deal!! 

00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.140
 Very annoying 

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:37.460
 It's like everything is good. I'm just snapping this out now, I'm definitely hoping nothing is going wrong 

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:43.100

 This was another week of Spaghett 

00:09:55.500 --> 00:10:00.420
 Remember to send your jokes in Pewdiepie subreddit offers 

00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:02.140
 It's the greatest subreddit all the time 

00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.600
 This literally repeat this week with 20,000 this madness 

00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:09.900
 The jokes improve, I will not lie, the jokes improve 

00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.120
 Well, we need a chair more 

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:19.740
 I mean less chair jokes and more original content. Ali Who is joking? This will never happen 

00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:26.200
 Thank you for watching Leave a favor if you enjoyed
