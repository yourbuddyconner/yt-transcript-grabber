00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.699
 If you want to simulate something in the physical world nowadays 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:03.790
 use a computer. 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.050
 But what if that was not possible? 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:07.220
 What if you lived in the 50s 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.030
 and you had to determine whether a bold but uncertain plan 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.329
 to contain the Bay of San Fransisco was a good idea? 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:19.700
 The answer is this: the bay model of the US Army Corps of Engineers. 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:22.570
 The bay model is larger than half a hectare. 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.120
 What you are looking at now is one of our earlier scientific, hydrodynamic 

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.930
 technical test facilities. 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.381
 And this was the instrument they used to watch 

00:00:33.381 --> 00:00:38.230
 what the unforeseen consequences of the John Reberplan would be. 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.470
 In the 40s and 50s a man named John Reber 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.280
 a plan to completely change the Bay of San Fransisco. 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.450
 Huge dams would make freshwater lakes. 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.110
 There would be new land reclamation for industry and for air or naval ports. 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.120
 Reber said it would make the bay a defendable military fortification, 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.770
 bring people safely to land, 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:02.290
 and the now dammed rivers would provide enormous amounts of drinking water. 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.100
 Reber was not a professional engineer. 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.450
 He was a theater producer who did a lot of research, 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.110
 but because he worked in the showbiz, he knew how to sell something. 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.700
 And according to most, he was a kind, sincere, convincing man. 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.490
 So contrary to other ideas for gigantic construction projects, the Reber plan actually hit. 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.049
 Discussions went back and forth for years, but ultimately 

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:27.180
 seemed Reber's plan realistic enough, at least for politicians, 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.610
 that the US Army Corps of Engineers was commissioned to see if it was practical. 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.340
 And they got $ 2.5 million, that's about 25 million today, to figure it out. 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.380
 And with that they built this. 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.619
 This model was, when it was built, the next step, the new generation. 

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.780
 It was extremely accurate as an instrument. 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.060
 At that time there was not really anything better. 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.299
 There are 250 000 strategically placed small copper cubes in the bottom of the model 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:58.119
 to prevent the salt water and fresh water from flowing in and out too quickly, 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:04.009
 but also to model small protrusions that may be in the bottom of the bay. 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.560
 The model has a scale of 1: 1000 horizontal, 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.880
 1: 100 scale vertical and 1: 100 scale in time. 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.970
 That means about 200 times a day 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.140
 the flood becomes and then again ebb, 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.180
 Because the Bay of San Fransisco has tides, and therefore the model too. 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.980
 Everything was hand-operated for the first 30 years. 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.060
 It took about 12 to 15 people to operate it, 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.670
 but sometimes there were 60 people at the same time 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.940
 who worked on all different experiments 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.890
 and everyone had to work completely synchronously. 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.090
 It was like an orchestra. 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:41.020
 And the trainees were there on chairs, in lab coats, in the water, 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:44.260
 to measure different currents of the tide. 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.830
 It took 3 years to test Rebers plan 

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.030
 and in that time Reber died. 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.379
 And for his supporters the results of the model were terrible. 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.110
 It looked good on paper, and convinced many people, 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.570
 but when they tested it, they saw that it was only good on paper. 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.600
 The end result is that it failed in as many as 99 different ways. 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.580
 Wild and unpredictable catastrophic floods are just one of them. 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.730
 The dams would not make lakes, but evaporation tanks. 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.890
 The tide would make dangerous currents and waves. 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.440
 In short, the Reberplan would not only become a disaster, 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.270
 it would be a billion dollar disaster. 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:25.150
 The ecosystem would also be destroyed, 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.040
 but it was the 50s, so nobody really thought about that. 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.810
 the Corps of Engineers after they had done their work, 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.239
 thought that the model could ever be useful again. 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:34.239
 And that's what it was, 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.430
 to test smaller and more practical plans across the bay for the coming decades. 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.200
 These days computers can do this of course 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:42.349
 for a fraction of the time and money, 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:44.730
 but it is still a good educational tool. 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.349
 The last time that is talked about a grand civil construction plan like this, 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:48.840
 about Hermal SÃ¶rgels Atlantropa, 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.780
 I said it was an example of how big we can dream, 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.330
 but this model is an example of something else. 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:55.330
 From science. 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.910
 Have a hypothesis. 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:58.070
 From those tests. 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.270
 And then, if it fails, admit that it is wrong. 

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.220
 There should be no shame in it. 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.410
 Sometimes we pursue bad ideas, 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.400
 and we change our mind on the basis of new evidence 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.750
 and allow others to do the same 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.549
 and that's something our world should build on, 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.860
 and that is exactly what this model did.
