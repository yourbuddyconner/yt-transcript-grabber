00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.709
 This is the kilogram. Not just an ordinary kilogram, that's the kilogram. 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:06.290
 British National Standard Kilogram (British National Standard Kilogram), 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:08.950
 in the National Physical Laboratory in Teddington. 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.929
 It's a piece of platinum alloy and iridia, 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:13.799
 is kept in a very, very secure vault down here, 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.770
 and weighs ... well, one kilogram. 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.800
 Measurement of matter must be the same throughout the world. 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.600
 So when I buy something in America that weighs milligram, kilogram, or 100 tons, 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.490
 I need to know that it is equal to a milligram, 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.770
 kilogram or 100 tonnes in the UK. 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.769
 Areas where these doubts are really important 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:34.640
 is for example the pharmaceutical industry, 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.519
 where you treat really, really small amounts of active ingredients 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.679
 and you have to measure them very, very accurately. 

00:00:39.679 --> 00:00:42.350
 So when it was made, let's say, your personal weight, 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.489
 was tested against the tools that were tested against the tools that 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:49.219
 several positions in the chain before, 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:51.929
 was tested against something like that. 

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:57.269
 And this was tested against the International Prototype Kilogram in Paris. 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.569
 And that's a very strange thing to understand, 

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:05.160
 but the one in Paris? He always weighs one kilogram. 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.570
 It does not matter if he took a little weight by absorbing dirt from the air, 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.470
 or lost some weight while cleaning. 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.030
 It's just one kilogram. 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.950
 We know that the International Prototype is probably not stable, 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.320
 because all his copies are unstable with respect to him. 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.450
 But there is nothing higher than the International Prototype to compare 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:27.270
 and see if it changes or not. 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.790
 Defining international standards using physical things is not ... ideal, 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.780
 so in the coming years scientists around the world 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.060
 decide what standard will be for the 21st century. 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.980
 The formal definition will be based on physics, probably Planck's constant, 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.640
 but how do you make a physical object? 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.140
 We have two options: first, the specified number of atoms. 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.460
 We can quite easily produce a kilogram sphere 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.430
 from an almost pure, single-crystal silicon. 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:58.490
 The dimension (crystal) grid must be measured, 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.880
 ie how far there are atoms in the sphere, 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:04.230
 and bullet volume. And these two measurements 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:07.320
 we can do it with a degree of inaccuracy, 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.729
 where we can create a sphere with precision 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.069
 about 10 to eight. 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:15.689
 The bad news is that one such ball costs 2.5 million euros. (about 67 million crowns) 

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.870
 Searching a kilogram this way makes sense, it seems. 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.230
 Finally, we measure matter. 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.349
 But there is an alternative that would be easier and cheaper, 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.689
 although not so obvious. 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:28.620
 Watt equilibrium is an electrical way of measuring matter. 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.650
 Now, let's just show you how the watt balance works. 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.639
 Here we have a speaker, 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:39.700
 and when I let go of his coil, 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.999
 we see that the cone moves up and down. 

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:47.609
 When I lay the weights, 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:51.370
 when I restore my position, 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.480
 Thanks to the current that I use, we measure the weight of the weights. 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.310
 The problem is, I do not know the strength of the magnet field, 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.109
 nor the number of spool threads. 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:08.260
 I can make a second attempt by moving the speaker cone like that. 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.230
 If I measured the speed at which I would move, 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.849
 and also measured the produced voltage, 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:20.549
 I would find a value I could deduct from these two attempts. 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:25.169
 Which, if done exactly, is enough to count the weight of that weight. 

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:26.719
 Whichever procedure we choose, 

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:29.620
 we will always have physical kilograms to compare. 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:31.790
 Nothing will disappear, but for the first time 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:35.700
 we will have something absolute with which we can compare them. 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.499
 Thank you all in the National Physical Laboratory! 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:40.810
 They have a YouTube channel you can watch, 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.810
 and occasionally hold open days. Details are on your site.
