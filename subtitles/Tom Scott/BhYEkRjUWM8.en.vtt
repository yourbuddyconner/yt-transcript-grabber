00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
 TOM: We have filmed a lot of B-roll in Pripyat 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.460
 And we can not all use that. 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.540
 We think we will get a lot of questions about how we got into the zone, 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.680
 so we are going to show a lot of cool images 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.360
 of what have done, and then 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.400
 we answer some of the questions that are coming. 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.400
 How do you get here? 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.360
 PAUL: coming here is actually very simple 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.420
 It's not difficult. There is no 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.360
 drama. It is as simple as 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.660
 organizing an excursion on a normal holiday. 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.000
 About. There are some 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.740
 technical details you need to arrange, 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.460
 all paperwork must be signed off 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.120
 but, a company does that for you. 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.260
 There are many different levels, 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.540
 we have gone for a private tour, 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.180
 you can also join a bus full of people. 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.620
 TOM: I'm sure there is - that a level is even deeper than what we do now. 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.880
 I mean, we're not in a bad hotel here, 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.400
 Given we are in the middle-- We are actually in the forbidden zone. 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.520
 Yes, I have a shower, I have a bed, I have one 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.160
 screen door that stops insects, 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.260
 PAUL: Wi-fi internet? 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.240
 TOM: Yes, that's a point! 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.060
 We can upload this from here we want. 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.880
 We got 5 meg, 1 Mb up. 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.660
 And again, we are in the forbidden zone, here. 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.660
 What kind of permission do you need? 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.980
 PAUL: Permission is not being dealt with by us - we are not worried about the wizards. 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.320
 This is done by the travel organization and that is relatively standard paperwork 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.740
 TOM: Yes, the answer is that you pay the travel company the right amount of money 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.500
 Um, we do not really want to recommend a travel company 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.860
 Uh, because in case we have broken rules somewhere - we want to put the tour company in trouble 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.040
 and also because it is a few months later by the time you see this. 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:32.300
 The company can then be in different hands. So do research, look at reviews, make a recommendation from a friend if you can. 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.820
 But in the end permission comes from them 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.820
 What do you get access to? 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.460
 TOM: We saw a lot of abandoned buildings in Pripyat 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.520
 uh, of course that's kind of ... 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.840
 PAUL: Many of them are starting to merge into each other and ... 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.000
 You can go to so many rooms with a few cabinets, some devices that have been stripped of all their copper 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.960
 that you can see before it becomes monotonous 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.620
 TOM: But you also have things like the culture palace, the culture palace 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.740
 PAUL: That was special 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.880
 TOM: That was the moment where I ... 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.080
 I walked out of there and into the main square in Pripyat 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:11.080
 and there is a hotel that has been abandoned, it is overgrown, trees are coming through the concrete. 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.780
 and that was the moment I thought ... 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.520
 This used to be a city with 40,000 people in it 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.140
 This ... this used to be lively and this is what happens when you leave it for a while 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.900
 That was that moment of, oh, ok 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:29.660
 PAUL: The scale is also immediately clear. I mean... 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.440
 40,000 people is kind of ... 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:37.480
 it's a nice number, but that does not mean much until you recognize the scale compared to a city in the UK 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.140
 TOM: Yes, or wherever you live 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.300
 PAUL: And this was a young city, this was a professional city, the average age here was about 26. That's where I am and-- Tom is timeless 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.740
 And they were people like us, they were, I mean, I'm not a physicist, but I have a reasonable understanding of science 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.540
 and that was kind of the level of the people who worked on maintenance here 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.080
 they had to be reasonably qualified to come into the city 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.060
 It was a beautiful one, for that time. It was a model city 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.420
 And because of that, there is a lot of footage of the city in operation 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.400
 you can go back and watch the heyday 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.420
 and when you place yourself there, in its current state of decline 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.520
 that gives a lot of realization 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.300
 TOM: Yes, yes. It is bleak 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.100
 Uh, I mean there is always the question if you do something like this, because it is essentially disaster tourism 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.280
 It's been 30 years ... 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:33.200
 It has already been pillaged, destroyed, looted 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.440
 Nothing is intact 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.680
 Something of value that could be taken away is gone 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.020
 All that sentimental value is taken either by the original owner 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.800
 or has recently been destroyed 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.700
 You do not walk on consecrated ground 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.280
 But as it is not a nice 'let's go do things' vacation 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:56.540
 PAUL: Yes. You expect to go up with a smile and thumbs and, yes, there is in the more ... 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.480
 TOM: Yes, I have very inappropriate ... 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:03:59.540
 I took a selfie ... 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.300
 You will see the Chernobyl reactor 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.740
 you are about 100 meters away, on the spot where tourists may come 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.520
 you are 100 meters away from the reactor that exploded 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:12.640
 And, ok ... 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.480
 it is ... I ... 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.700
 And I just laughed instinctively at the camera 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.120
 That ... that felt wrong 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.340
 PAUL: It feels a bit wrong, but we are tourists, we are on vacation of sorts 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.780
 and at the same time all Geiger counters go off. 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:32.300
 they can not be muted, so we all squeak loudly and are grinning a bit cheesy 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.200
 that seems a bit inappropriate, but ... 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.240
 TOM: We passed the red forest 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:36.980
 PAUL: Oh yes 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.540
 TOM: We had to go through that speed, because even in a vehicle on speed your Geiger counter goes off. 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:43.780
 because the forest is remote from the nuclear power plant 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.240
 so it has absorbed radioactivity and it is now, again giving off 

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.580
 PAUL: Yes, for whatever reason they have not cleaned it. 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.460
 Maybe it just was not useful for continued activities, but uh ... 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.700
 TOM: because they have gone through, that's the important thing, 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.680
 The city was not immediately abandoned 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:03.580
 The other reactors experience another decade or so. 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.060
 PAUL: Yes, in the mid-90s if I remember correctly 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 TOM: It's an interesting place. There is a lot to see, although much of it is not more than "here is another abandoned building" 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.560
 If that is your thing, this would be great 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.560
 Can you break into it? 

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.740
 PAUL: Technically, yes, but ... 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:21.260
 TOM: No. 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:24.560
 PAUL: Most of what you will see online is exaggerated 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.360
 because it is a good story 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.860
 and I do not intend to deny that, it is a good story 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.200
 if someone claims that they have broken into the zone 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:31.940
 woah, brilliant! 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:34.640
 And they will give the photos, they will have a brilliant story 

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:39.560
 But then they start giving obvious information and then know they were on a tour 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.200
 because there are certain things that you need to be pointed out 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.400
 there would be no way you would find certain details within the zone unless you had a guide 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.160
 TOM: Yes, and you are obliged to have a zone guide 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.680
 For example, there is no other way to get past all checkpoints. 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:56.100
 you have to pass through a few radioactive forests 

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.900
 PAUL: And for Pripyat center should go through 3? 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.740
 TOM: You should go through three different checkpoints 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:02.120
 or avoid it 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.880
 You should avoid the patrolling police 

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.300
 And you should find the way 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.580
 Yes, it is theoretically possible 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.200
 In practice, no, I do not think many people have actually broken into 

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:17.200
 Is it dangerous? 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:22.920
 TOM: If you follow your guide, if you do not do stupid things, no it is not particularly dangerous 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:26.300
 You do not go to a high radiation area 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:29.240
 You get a Geiger counter in case 

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.800
 There is really not much that is dangerous there 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:39.820
 That said, the rules about what you can and can not do seem to change regularly 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.020
 And are not always followed by different guides and different groups 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:49.800
 PAUL: Yes, so this trip, for example, the official guidelines of mid-2012 was 'you can not enter the buildings' 

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:50.620
 TOM: Everyone was in the buildings 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:52.660
 PAUL: Everyone was in buildings. It is the most interesting 

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:53.960
 Of course you enter the buildings 

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:55.180
 We climbed to the top of one 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:57.180
 TOM: Yes, indeed. 16 floors up 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.380
 And, again, not dangerous 

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.700
 Guides knew it. We went up 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.500
 PAUL: Do not get me wrong. The advice of health and safety is here "do not hurt yourself" 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.740
 The roof did not have a good railing 

00:07:07.740 --> 00:07:12.580
 There were a few railings at your height to make sure you did not fall, but 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:16.300
 you could, if you wanted to be stupid, you could hurt yourself 

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.160
 The elevator shafts in that 16-storey building were open 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:23.140
 TOM: They were open and there was a cord on the other side, in front of one 

00:07:23.140 --> 00:07:24.800
 PAUL: Yes, just in case ... 

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.100
 TOM: In case you wanted to, yes ... 

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:27.740
 PAUL: Perfect 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:29.940
 TOM: Do not drink tap water 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:36.160
 I can not say that you will get diarrhea somewhere where there are no toilets 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:38.580
 In a [laughs] in a nuclear zone accident 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.480
 But I would not mess it if I were you 

00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.140
 Bottled water is cheap 

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.060
 Everything is cheap here. How much was the beer here? 

00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:48.780
 PAUL: I just enjoyed 2 pints for £ 1 

00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:54.280
 TOM: Yes, um. Cigarettes, if someone out there is a smoker, about 20 or 30P is a suit 

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.200
 It is amazingly cheap here 

00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.280
 How long that will remain is another matter 

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.280
 Is it ghostly? 

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.420
 TOM: I was planning to say no 

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:06.780
 PAUL: I'm going with yes 

00:08:06.780 --> 00:08:07.760
 TOM: What is your reasoning? 

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:10.300
 PAUL: There is now and then, and it happened in the tower that we climbed 

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.960
 We turned a corner ... 

00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.460
 A dark corridor ... 

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:17.060
 A few mailboxes, a kind of pigeon hole with colors ... 

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.920
 A gust of wind came along and that all creaked at once 

00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:23.160
 And I thought I saw something at the end of the corridor 

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.460
 Kind of, a bit of a horror movie situation 

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:29.340
 TOM: Ok, maybe I was not in a situation where that happened 

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:31.120
 PAUL: Seconds later, absolutely fine 

00:08:31.120 --> 00:08:34.280
 TOM: Cause, I do not know. Middle of winter, dead of the night 

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.180
 When it gets cold and inclement and dark and rainy 

00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:40.240
 Yes, then I understand. But we were here in the middle of summer 

00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:43.700
 It is a very strange place, but I would not say it is creepy. 

00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:46.520
 PAUL: No, there is certainly gravity 

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:47.980
 which we have alluded to 

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:50.920
 TOM: You will have noticed that parts are being added extra 

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:55.580
 There have been a lot of photographers and some of them are not so ... 

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:58.600
 Do not be so careful with things untouched 

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:01.740
 PAUL: No, there is not a single original recording that we can make here and we are not going to claim that they are there. 

00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.580
 I mean, we're going to try it. We got a drone, that's cool, but even that is done 

00:09:05.580 --> 00:09:06.220
 TOM: Cat! 

00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:07.000
 Cat! Cat! 

00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:08.260
 There is a cat 

00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:09.860
 TOM: Really ... 

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.140
 PAUL: The worried cat is back
