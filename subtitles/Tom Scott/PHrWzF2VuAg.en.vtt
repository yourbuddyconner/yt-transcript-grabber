00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.120
 I'm here with Tef, who will tell 

00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:04.140
 something you may not know about origami 

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.460
 Tef, be'go 'and tell. 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:07.700
 I would like to tell you about a piece of origami, 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.100
 that is in the room. Satellites have solar panels 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.240
 and solar panels should be unfolded. 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.960
 Imagine a paper slowly unfolding. 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.520
 Unfortunately, in order to unfold most solar panels, one needs to use 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.180
 two engines. One to pull it this way, and one to pull the other way, 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.880
 this way. But Japanese astrophysicists realized that one 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.220
 probably could do it with one engine instead, and what 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.880
 He found out this was. He could take a solar panel 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.360
 and fold it all the way out with only one engine. 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.480
 Not only that, he could also fold it all the way in. 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.380
 How to do this is to fold the paper 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.720
 in fifths, such. Granted, now I get it to look easy, 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.500
 and then you keep folding it again and again, 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.880
 and make almost a snake all the way, so there is 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.920
 a small angle all the way. But what this is 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.420
 meaning is that the paper can fold a lot 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.840
 more compact and much faster than that 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:06.520
 common way of folding. This way of folding is called 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.440
 Miura folding and it is also used for anything other than solar panels. You have 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.200
 recently tested it with lithium-ion batteries 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.680
 because it folds so compactly that it improves 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.620
 energy density. But that's not why I love this. 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.760
 Not because it has been in the room, but because it works 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.480
 really good with cards. One can take a card out of his 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.400
 pocket, fold it out quickly, see exactly where you are, and 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.780
 Quickly fold it back together. And no other folds I know of 

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.460
 for short, can do this. So despite being one 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.720
 fantastic piece of origami that has been in the room, is it 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.600
 In fact, the most useful piece of origami I know of 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.500
 down here on earth.
