00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.030
 (Degenerated laughter) 

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.030
 (Remains fake and provoked laughing) 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:06.030
 (Extreme coughing and laughing) 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.189
 Oh sorry. I did not see you there. I just laughed at my favorite moving picture on the internet. 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.300
 Oh, you also like gifs? Ha, what do you think of this? 

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.920
 add me to league or legends: MrDyon 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.929
 It is a moving picture. It is the nicest thing on the internet. 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:23.620
 (More fake laugh) 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.620
 Why are you laughing? 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.540
 You will not believe it. Stalin has cancer. 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.420
 Do you want to win all gift vouchers below? 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.560
 PewDiePie died at the age of 69. 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.520
 That's right. Today we are going to talk about gifts and where your complete Lodha generated scumbag is used for. 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.670
 That's right, I said it. 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.000
 The first thing you need to know about GIFs is that it is an acronym for GOD I ... 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.360
 ... FLIPPING SUCK. I added the last piece. Was just a joke of boys. It is actually an acronym for ... 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.140
 GRAPHIC INTERCHANGE FORMAT 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.040
 Hmmm ... Interesting ... 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.139
 And secondly, more importantly, it is pronounced as GIF okay? And if you call it JIF ... 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.470
 Then I do not know what to tell you. There must be something wrong with you. Are you genuinely disturbed? But Felix de ... 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.029
 ... makers call it JIFs, so it has to be good to speak out. 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.769
 Ohh okay. So because you have invented something, it means that you are the literary scholar how it is pronounced. 

00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:44.640
 What if I tell you that the maker of cars pronounces it as 'CARS'. 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:53.060
 Because the inventor of 'CRS' pronounces it as 'CR'. So stupid. Does not matter at all. You look as stupid as you think. Do not make me laugh. 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.729
 Stop. Not the gifts. I can not. It's too funny. 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.329
 Do you even know what the verb of JIF means? 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.710
 Let's just entertain the idea of ​​saying a JIF. Do you know what JIF means? 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.429
 Do you know? You do not want to know. Let me geode with that homo. 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:16.988
 I do not discriminate against your weird sexual desires, but no. JIFFING is not allowed. All right? Stop it! 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.119
 It seems that many of your lobotimists have problems to pronounce the word JIF. You just called me a lobotomist. 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.319
 This... 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:29.439
 ... because Dr. Theo Jo is going to put some fair knowledge before you. It is JIF. 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.979
 It is pronounced as JIF. And you know what I'm not going to say. 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.080
 It is because of how the makers said it. It is not even a factor. Just ignore that. There is no J in GIF. 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:43.000
 There is no reason to put it this way ... Oh, and what about gim, giraffe, gel, gin ... 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.920
 ginger, general. You just have to forget it, right? Felix: Hey Jo, 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.269
 You seem a bit upset ... Will I give you a JIFT? Do you want me to JIFT you? 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.090
 Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhh ...... 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.819
 Oh I'm sorry. Is the 'G' for the acronym 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:03.459
 JRAPHICS or GRAPHICS. 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.170
 Let's see what other stupid arguments there are. You will ... 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.060
 There are about 1 million words in the English language and statistically about 1.95% ... 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.639
 ... of them starts with a G. That is ... 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.000
 ... 19500 words starting with a G. On Wikipedia there is an article. That literally has a list of words ... 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.149
 ... where a hard G is used instead of a soft G. 

00:03:25.149 --> 00:03:30.880
 So the fact that you actually make an article. Small enough to put them on a list should give away a bit. Felix: Okay, well ... 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.720
 ... let's examine the article. Here is the same article. I found it. A list of English words where G ... 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.500
 ... is pronounced expansively. Oh look! GIF is in it! 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.960
 Wow! What a great article you found! Wow, that really proved your point, did not it? 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.680
 (Claps sarcastically) 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:54.100
 There are 61 words on that list. Let's finish it to 100. 100 of the 19500 is ... 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.590
 ... 0.5%. So you would rather claim that JIF is an exception to a rule that ... 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:05.078
 ... 99.5% of the time is followed instead of admitting that you never looked up the grammar rule first. 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:05.720
 Oh... 

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.129
 ... so because ... 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.349
 ... statistically it is less likely that it is pronounced in one way or another, it means that it is pronounced. Yes... 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:19.849
 That is absolutely logical according to that logic, all these words must be pronounced as jecko, jeek, jeese. It's the same idea right? 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:24.230
 Now it is less likely that you pronounce it that way. You 'joofus'. 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.370
 You 'jummy'. 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.570
 You 'jum jum'. You jummie dumb spank jumbie butt. 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.909
 It stands for 'Graphics Interchange Format'. So it must be a hard G. 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.339
 This is such a stupid argument that you immediately sound like an idiot. Felix: No not. Shut up. 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.180
 I made a poll on Twitter to see what you thought was the best way to say it. 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:49.280
 Oh look! Most of you think you pronounce it with a hard G. So that means statistically ... 

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.859
 ... that it is good of course, right? And of course... 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:59.299
 Wikipedia is the most trusted site of all time to retrieve your sources. What if we look up GIF in a real dictionary? 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:06.079
 Oh look! What is the first thing that appears? GIF with a hard G! Wow that was really hard, right? 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:10.099
 That's right, I have you hard on the GIF problem. 'Haters gonna hate'. 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.040
 Am I right? Certainly glad that we have arranged that now 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:18.409
 Now let's move on to the real problem of the GIFs. GIFs have been around for longer than ... 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.559
 ...25 years. It started as a cute little dancing baby. Wow look at that. Do you recognize them? 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.229
 Only 90's children remember it. 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.669
 How about the 'Peanut butter jelly banana'. That was funny right? 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:38.089
 GIFs used to be so cute and so innocent that they were used to make websites look good. 

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:41.100
 I remember that I created a website that only had GIFs. 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:46.960
 Look at these beautiful butterflies. You can no longer see such GIFs. 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.660
 You just do not do that. 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.680
 Look at this amazing frame rate of this. Wow. 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.500
 It seems like I'm actually there. Love Star Wars GIFs. Those are the best. 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:58.400
 Well, guess what it is now. It's junk. 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.530
 It's just junk. So much junk. If you post a GIF in the last 7 days ... 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:09.280
 ... I have news for you. Your mother gay. That's just how it is. Sorry. I know what you think. 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:11.380
 How do we go from this ... to this? 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:13.040
 Video: Ever shared this? 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.420
 Or this? 

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:16.200
 Nothing like a good reaction GIF right? 

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:21.120
 But you have probably noticed that the most popular are black people who are dramatic. 

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.320
 This. 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.640
 Meme: 'It's for real estate' 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.120
 Boys it is ... 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:31.760
 ... time to stop. I do not understand why people like it so much to use GIFs. They are not funny. 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.889
 They are rarely funny or grinnik worthy. 

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:36.960
 But it is still spread out. 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:38.420
 Just like a disease. 

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:42.660
 I tried to look for a few cringy examples of people who used GIFs. 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:44.660
 And the only thing that popped up. 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.080
 Were people who cringen. What is cringy of itself. You are... 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:56.370
 ... what you are trying to show that you are against. Wake up. A GIF sharing of you cringen is cringend. 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.280
 Marzia: Stop hating! Felix: Get out and post GIFs. Can not believe it. My own GF. 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:08.780
 Go! It is time to stop. 

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:12.320
 Do you know why GIFs are so popular? Because of the internet. 

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:15.340
 No, I'm not talking about my channel. I'm talking about Tumblr. 

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:21.090
 It is as if you always need at least ten images to stimulate your brain to distract from the fact that you ... 

00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.720
 ... are an anxious depressed teenager. That is Tumblr. 

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.749
 Congratulations everyone. When someone greets you by name, and you do not recognize them. 

00:07:37.630 --> 00:07:41.249
 When you are sitting between two people who are fighting. 

00:07:44.860 --> 00:07:46.920
 So approachable. Oh my God! 

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:51.460
 When you are expected to run to a friend, you have just heard a rumor. 

00:07:51.460 --> 00:07:53.160
 (Does GIF.) 

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:56.220
 Do you have any kind of character of yourself? 

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:01.499
 Do you really need celebrities to portray your emotions and words, then you are literally so empty ... 

00:08:01.660 --> 00:08:07.800
 ... that you can not even express yourself without using the image in someone else's video and text. 

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.800
 Now I know it's an argument that: oh, you're stealing memes and GIFs. 

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:16.600
 It is the same, but you do not just steal the joke. You steal the whole character of another person. It is pathetic 

00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:18.600
 But Felix we just have fun. 

00:08:18.920 --> 00:08:22.300
 It is not allowed to have fun! Not on this channel. 

00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:26.440
 BuzzFeed is of course also a big problem why GIFs are so popular. 

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:32.989
 Can you imagine that you are studying for four years to become a journalist - and then work on a new side of writing articles called: 

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:40.130
 19 things that even healthy people do that are actually bad for you. Spend up to $ 75,000 to get your degree. 

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:45.019
 - then it is told hey, this is a great article and what you wrote was really great ... 

00:08:45.019 --> 00:08:52.068
 ... but we can just add more photos of celebrities coming in because your words were not enough. 

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.369
 Ignore your body and refuse to make medical appointments. 

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:01.969
 If you are not convinced of my ideas about why GIFs are bad, do not worry. 

00:09:01.969 --> 00:09:08.480
 There are straightforward facts to explain this. GIFs were originally popular because they were efficient. 

00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:11.900
 GIF uses a photocompression called LZW 

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:15.020
 What stands for: LOL, ZORS, WOW. 

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.380
 Just kidding. Sometimes I want to invent things. 

00:09:18.500 --> 00:09:19.880
 LZW 

00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:27.460
 It is a lossless compression algorithm that likes to quickly download a large image, even if you have a slow bandwidth. 

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:35.280
 Great, yes. It was amazing. 20 years ago .GIFs have now been surpassed by their superior: PNG. 

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.960
 But I want moving images. We all know GIFs have existed for a long time. It is an old format. 

00:09:40.969 --> 00:09:47.980
 But now people popularize it by adding images and moving images. That is when it has clearly become an outdated format. 

00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:52.580
 Do not believe me. I will link two examples in the description, just click on them. 

00:09:52.580 --> 00:10:00.000
 I have a fairly fast internet and these GIFs are not downloaded unless I open them separately, they will load faster. 

00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:07.160
 The reason why the video is faster than the GIF is because it is about 2 MB instead of the GIF which is 14 MB. 

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:09.080
 Damn Daniel. 

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:14.000
 The video can also start streaming and does not have to download everything to play the video. 

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:18.920
 While the poison must download the entire file to display correctly. 

00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:21.800
 But why is this so? 

00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.640
 Because of video compression. That's right. 

00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:32.520
 If this setup that I have with the camera for example takes up very little space on your computer or at least when I am sitting on my computer, because ... 

00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:37.540
 Simple background. I do not move much. How the video compression works ... 

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:44.659
 ... is that only the images that are put in motion are processed 

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.149
 Unless the background changes. Which leads to much less data being wasted. Yeah. 

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:54.440
 But if you start by adding a lot of things that move on the screen, and if I'm going crazy ... 

00:10:54.570 --> 00:11:01.760
 ... and you add a lot of confetti and stuff. You quickly see that the quality of the video drops considerably. 

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.800
 But that's how we can have so many videos on YouTube and for so long. Thank you. 

00:11:07.020 --> 00:11:11.810
 Thanks to the efficiency of video compression. There are so many things made possible. Hoera! 

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.919
 It is also very cool if the video compression fails. 

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:37.360
 ♪ Music ♪ 

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:39.500
 Damn stop with the GIFs! 

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:44.720
 "But Pewds not everyone has bad internet so we do not need models." 

00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:51.360
 There is no reason to be intentionally inefficient. All right. There is a better solution. That's right. 

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:53.940
 HTML5 elements. 

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:02.620
 It is getting hot to play. It can make loop if you want. look at this beauty. 

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:09.649
 Oh, please, right away, even though the whole thing is not buffered yet. And it has sound. It has volume control. 

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:15.020
 You can pause it. You can choose to repeat it if you wish. You can adjust the volume. 

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:22.160
 You can easily download it. And you can work with it in full screen. And the coding for it is also very simple. 

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.560
 HTML5 Elements ... 

00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:32.569
 ...everybody. That's right. If you have just been trained. Oh snap! 

00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:39.170
 You have just been added to the GIF topic. What other argument do you have for the use of that mess? 

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:43.759
 Okay, everybody now. We can finally agree on at least two things. 

00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.730
 It is pronounced as GIF and you must stop using it. 

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:52.159
 I know it is sad, but at some point all things must come to an end. And I think it's time that we finally ... 

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:54.710
 ... stop this outdated format. 

00:12:54.710 --> 00:13:01.609
 I know how I will express my life if I can not express myself through ariana grande GIFs. 

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:03.410
 I know. It will be difficult. 

00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:08.269
 But you can get this through. I believe in you. Just think about our Ariana herself. 

00:13:08.370 --> 00:13:12.980
