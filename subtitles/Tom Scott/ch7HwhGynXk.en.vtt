00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:07.079
 Firearm possession is a controversial topic. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, there are strict rules: 

00:00:07.079 --> 00:00:11.560
 it is difficult to get even a permit, and even the majority of the police do not carry a firearm. 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.900
 In the United States, the right to firearms is a fundamental right and a political battlefield. 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:24.410
 And then ... then there is Spitsbergen. Welcome to the Polar Circle, 78 degrees north latitude, where 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.300
 polar bears are a real, and very deadly, danger. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.420
 This is obviously not deadly here. 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.120
 In 2011, a class of young children camped about 40 kilometers from here, and fell victim cases 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.280
 a bear; one of them was killed and others were seriously injured. In 2015, a camper became here 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.370
 for the eclipse of the sun set by a bear. To counter this threat, is Spitsbergen 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.739
 the only place in the world where wearing a firearm is mandatory by law. 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.980
 There is a village in the south of the US where possession of a firearm is mandatory, but that law was one 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.670
 political move: you do not have to actually carry it with you and nobody supervises the execution. 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.579
 Here, however, the Spitsberg regulations require that every group traveling outside the main 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.770
 settlements, at least one gun with him, and someone who knows how to handle the weapon 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.930
 use. If you, like me, do not have a permit? Then you can only go outside on a guided tour. 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.930
 Finding a bear is unlikely, but it is a risk that you do not want to take. 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.439
 That does not mean, however, that you have to be trigger-happy. If you actually have to use your firearm there is already 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.100
 something completely gone wrong. The tripwire around the camp has failed in activating 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.189
 the explosives, the lookout has fallen asleep and you could not chase away the bear by means of a 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.310
 warning shot. If you actually have to kill a bear you are tall and serious 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.220
 police investigation, but that is better than the long and serious police investigation 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.940
 takes place after you have been torn up. 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.480
