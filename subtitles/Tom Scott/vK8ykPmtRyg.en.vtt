00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.559
 This is how you can embed the worst nuclear disaster in history. This is the 

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:12.720
 new safe confinement construction, at reactor 4 in Chernobyl. 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:18.140
 In 1986 the nuclear power plant exploded here - and that's a phrase you never 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:23.470
 want to hear. The area has been cleared, and it will be uninhabitable here for millennia: 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.249
 to get here you need special permission, although it has become easy in the latter 

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:28.569
 years. 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:33.090
 In the months after the disaster, there is a concrete sarcophagus - called the shelter object 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.930
 - to built the damaged reactor. It is built quickly and desperately. The 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.380
 building has claimed many lives, and a megaton of concrete and metal has been used. It has worked, but will not 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.290
 stand for always, in addition it is built on the unstable remains of the old reactor. 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:54.880
 But there is a replacement, which is still being built on. The new safe confinement construction, 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.300
 that has cost more than one and a half billion US dollars. It is huge, a metal arch 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:07.110
 a hundred meters high. When it is finished, it becomes enormous tracks with steel cables 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.390
 moved over the reactor in a week. If the arch is there, the sides will be filled, 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.470
 and the reactor is again protected, ready to be safely dismantled. This is 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.510
 the world's largest movable object - although it will only have to move once. 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.800
 It has some pretty amazing design requirements. Nothing can leak out. 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.830
 And all weather conditions that could possibly occur in Ukraine can handle a hundred 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.190
 year. 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.190
 Think about that. One and a half billion dollars for something that 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.090
 a hundred years. That's great - if we have the money in those hundred years, 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.850
 find the time and technology to safely get rid of all the radioactive material here. 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.450
 Is that going to work? Or, if there is no immediate threat of threats and disasters, we will move it 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.890
 by for future generations to worry about. 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.720
 In one hundred years, when the arch is at the end of its life, we dismantle 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.010
 him then and we celebrate that it succeeded? Or we spend so much money when building a replacement.
