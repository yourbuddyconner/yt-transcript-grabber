 [WRONG WRONG] There is an interesting thing about English that almost nobody thinks about. 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:09.570
 There are two TH sounds. And if you want to know why I have this again 21 times 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.540
 had to ... [GELACH] 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.650
 And if you want to know why I had to repeat this 22 times, try them 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.970
 to reverse yourself. 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.760
 The difference is intonation: you who let your vocal chords vibrate. The vocal cords 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.730
 are small flaps of mucous membrane that are in your larynx. 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.769
 So. Sit upright, and place your thumb and your fingers gently on your throat like this. You 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:33.070
 You do not have to sit up straight here, but it's a good exercise. 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.750
 Now make a / s / sound, as in the beginning of 'sing'. Ready? 'Sssss'. You would not do anything 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.130
 must feel. 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.710
 But now try a / z /. Ready? 'Zzzzz'. Feel 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.910
 you that vibration? 'Zzz' Try to switch between the two: Ssszzsszz. You can feel that it is on and 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.750
 goes out. That vibration is your vocal chords that flutter around. 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.370
 If you do a quick search on the internet, you can be glorious slow-motion 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.050
 see videos of vocal cords. Honestly, it makes me crazy. But it leaves 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:12.890
 see how much incredible control you have about those things, without knowing it. If 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.600
 you hit a good C, [hummm], not like this, you can do them 261 times a second 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.300
 let it open and close, without thinking about it. 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.770
 [Whispering] Sometimes you stop completely with intonation. Or [KRAKEND] you can 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.380
 limiting and slowing down to make a creaking voice. That has to do with the "vocal fry" phenomenon 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.460
 that irritates a lot of people? 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.780
 So, two different sounds - / s / and / z / - get two different letters. 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.950
 But now try it with TH. Start with th, as in 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.950
 think. Ready? 'TH'. Nothing. And now, th, as in then. Ready? 'TH'. 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.350
 That is the vibration again. 'TH'; 'TH'; 'TH'; 'TH'. Exactly the same difference as S and Z 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:13.110
 but these two sounds are written with the same two letters. 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.220
 But English has a lot of weirdness like that, hey. It sounds simple enough? S for the 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.220
 / s / without intonation, Z for the / z / with intonation. Well no. Believing that would be unwise. The 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.930
 depths of how intonation slips and glides between consonants is better for a textbook and 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.670
 a university teacher because it is very complicated. 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.910
 But, as a start to get you thinking, let me say this: the difference between 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:44.900
 "bob" and "pop" is intonation. So here is something you can try to find out: 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.319
 where does your intonation go on and off with the word "pop"? Because in most dialects that O is pronounced: like 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:58.000
 "mom and pop store". So think about the exact timing needed so that you say "pop" and 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.180
 not "bop" or "pob" 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.940
 And then forget about it. Because your brains are all self-sufficient. 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.860
