 let's start. Let's start everyone. Okay 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.559
 I've seen this before 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:55.420
 Ok, well this is my face right now, not impressed by it, although it is a very good adjustment, probably stolen by someone 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.860
 Well, it seems so far very good. I'm still excited. I am still a winner 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.540
 Guys. Can we keep this? This is far from where we got it 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.080
 a snake 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:25.100
 No, no, I did not laugh, I just laugh myself. It had nothing to do with the video 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.720
 I felt bored. I was thinking about other things. What was the snake's plan? 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:32.420
 Well Well 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:39.739
 Scottish accents are known for being difficult to understand, but the accent can be more difficult 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.670
 Glasweigan delasco in Norwegian Norwegian (speaking of dialect) 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.339
 I loved the Glassfian accent and I was wondering if you could teach me some local phrases 

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:54.619
 Well, he is very happy that I will be so. (Most words are inaccurate) 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.690
 I hope you have eyes (hard to understand) 

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:58.979
 You understand? * Laughing pewds * 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.979
 you do not understand? * Laugh * 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.039
 My God, I thought I had it for a while, is it just a joke or just an expansion of blood vessels? 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.139
 Well, this is very difficult 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.350
 *babbler* 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.429
 Exit the main Dangos 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.720

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.019
 Hardly heard his eyes, you see is not so difficult 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:43.890
 * Laugh * 

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.039
 I understand well, stupid. This outfit is cute. Did your husband give it to you? 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:55.759
 In fact, I bought this for me on the tenth anniversary. Is not he just darling? 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.619
 He is my favorite friend and companion of my life. I am not ashamed of myself nor should I 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.799
 Do I have to ?. Because I'm someone with strange abilities? 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.909
 Incidental exposure to radioactive spider blood will not be tolerant of those different creatures about you. You are on the wrong side of history 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.489
 Spider Man 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.129
 I have seen this mim before but frankly Jack made it better. Well done. Do you believe Disney published this? 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:22.670
 blatant 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:23.689
 Homosexuality 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:26.649
 Disgusting. What will they do next? Burn someone on some jokes? 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.280
 What is that 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.839
 No, this is it? 200,000 views? Yes 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.010
 What is that 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:47.420
 Yes 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:54.699
 Short and stupid. What is Yes in Japanese? Hello. Yes really. Yeah 

00:03:55.939 --> 00:03:57.349
 Oh 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:03:59.378
 Eeeh? Oh, it's like eeeh 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:03.760
 He speaks it .... 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.078
 (Japanese words) I bet they are not even half the volume 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:12.219
 From doing the sound. He should have asked me, I would have done better then 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:15.909
 Yes, choose PewDiePie wow 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:24.430

 I mean, I'll buy a mintuz afterwards. Montuz Please be my sponsor, I need patrons (means to advertise them) 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.349
 Well, if you represent a company, you feel you have a lot of money 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:27.620
 Let me know - I'll b- x3 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:30.100
 I will strengthen you, I told you guys 

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:37.789
 But what advice would you give to kids like me doing videos on YouTube but dreaming of having life-creating movies? 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:41.720
 I would say I will say well 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.740
 You have to take a deep breath and give up 

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:51.919
 No, the system is rigged against you. Hard work and talent will not pay off 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:56.360
 Nothing is on our way and we barely got here you do not have a chance 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.270
 You do it, you know, you make movies there (YouTube) that idea you like 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.149
 You're doing this, you know, I'm sure it means it 

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.160
 No contradiction. He tells him that he has already achieved his goal 

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.179
 What I feel is that my mind has slowed down more than anything that I can say to him 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.820
 I always say it as well 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.389
 It's a common thing to do and I understand perfectly 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:36.450
 that they 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:42.499
 It is very similar to the same thing. From now on I will not get a restriction. I will do ... instead of saying the word F 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.689
 I will say * screams * 

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:47.420
 I can not even do it as well. My God 

00:07:06.330 --> 00:07:08.330
 right Now 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.550
 divine 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:26.909
 Oh my God, so they won the war all. So they won the war 

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:29.379

00:07:30.729 --> 00:07:32.729
 Yes really 

00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.250
 Jump to fight 

00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:55.000
 Villains do not even pay attention to ... ... to get into the heart of the subject 

00:08:00.689 --> 00:08:02.689
 Michael is here 

00:08:11.319 --> 00:08:13.319
 This has a lot of nipples 

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.510
 The mates 

00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.780
 Jack's movie is wonderful 

00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:33.949
 Good. what do you want ? clap? 

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:40.669
 That's all you get. Well, I've watched this video. It is heroic work. Okay. Just a witness 

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:44.029
 Here is the most epic idea of ​​all time 

00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:52.420
 Who made this burger? 

00:08:54.180 --> 00:08:56.180
 "Who made this burger?" 

00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:01.900
 "Who made this burger?" "I know you hear me." 

00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.200
 Jason, I've created 

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:12.080
 Jason, you've created a man. 

00:09:12.899 --> 00:09:17.749
 So let me start. I just want to ask what this documentary is 

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:26.810
 You only know, I will just ask directly. Is this just a trifle to make people feel better about Paul Logan? Yes. at all. I 

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:29.750
 Means yes. Oh 

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.829
 divine 

00:09:34.829 --> 00:09:37.249
 And I sit with you now. What? 

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:41.120
 What is wrong with my life? 

00:09:43.110 --> 00:09:45.560
 Which I thought was a good idea? 

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:51.019
 My God, this is embarrassing, I want to make it clear 

00:09:51.019 --> 00:09:56.269
 I am the fastest and the best. Do you understand? I? 

00:09:57.510 --> 00:10:03.889
 I feel that this video does not even need editing. To make it awkward 

00:10:04.649 --> 00:10:06.649
 The whole world hates you. I 

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:12.529
 I made the conscious decision. I will rotate a dead mouse 

00:10:14.279 --> 00:10:19.578
 I mean, yes. When the world looks at this young man, he is a fighter 

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:23.810
 The doctor said he has 

00:10:27.149 --> 00:10:29.149
 To order? A few weeks to live 

00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:44.060
 To help Caroline, see this guy. This man suffers from a chronic disease 

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.479
 This is a challenge to laugh 

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:50.960
 Did you laugh or did you lose? If you lose as if you do not like?
