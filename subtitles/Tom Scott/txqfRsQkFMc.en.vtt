 Begining! 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:18.700
 HEBOCON is a "robot competition for technical shorts". 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.700

 There is a hindrance system to discourage high-tech robots. 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:56.740

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.380

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.380

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:10.860
 In the event of a draw, the winner is the robot that has gone the most distance. 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.960

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.280
 This Hebocon was held at the EMF Camp, a creator festival in the UK. 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.420
 I do not know which side the crowd will be. 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.380
 We have a beautiful, hand-made, knit robot ... 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.200
 ... against the toilet. 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:36.580
 32 robots have been in two-sided and quadrilateral knockout battles. 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.380
 Piloted by someone from Robot Wars ... 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.240
 You have no chance to get out of this looking like a good friend. It's like what! 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.180
 Lost wheel, wheel disappeared there - oh! 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.260

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.680
 So our big final ... 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.540

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.200
 Pinggu was a penguin clock in a cup, with a cane shield. 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.700
 Tiktat was a disassembled toy loaded with a dynamo spin. 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:25.900
 Finally, the victory was settled at a distance. 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.280
 6! 5! 4! 3! 2! 1! 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.280
 The winner should be: Tiktak! 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.420
 Hebocon does not have a question of victory, but of heboness. 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.800
