00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
 I'm in Bristol, a port city in southwest England. 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.500
 See this plaque? Remember this plaque - it will be important for a minute - 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.000
 because the board and its copy mark it, is the fact that it exists 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.020
 very literally, part of this city in New York. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 The same board, second position, here at Waterside Plaza in New York. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
 You see, here, on the East River, there are a lot of landfills. 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Originally, this whole part was a bit distant from the water, 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
 but in the Second World War, US naval ships went to Bristol, seeing it was almost completely disbanded 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
 and they really needed the burden to push them down the way back across the Atlantic, 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 so they took literally a shotgun, the brick of the bombed Bristole - and dangled on their ships, 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 bring them here, and just throw them in the East River. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
 This protrusion on the map here - This entire settlement has the same 60s and 70s 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 brick architecture, as well as Bristol because they were built at the same time - this resort here 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 and several streets in each direction, literally built on the ruins of Bristol. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
 I'm sitting on a piece of England here in New York. Something you might not know. 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.720
