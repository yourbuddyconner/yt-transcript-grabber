00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.550
 None of this I see. 

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.560
 I do not see the top of the mountain or a huge abyss 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.240
 and the camera is not assigned to any magical device. 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.290
 I'm in the Mixed Reality Lab at YouTube in New York 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.059
 and if I want to see something more than green walls around me, 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.910
 I will have to put on these glasses. 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.359
 The problem with virtual reality is, 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:21.999
 while a man with glasses is overwhelmed, 

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:24.249
 waving his hands and enjoying it, 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:27.019
 everyone else has no idea what's going on. 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:30.789
 Mixed reality is a way to let other people see, 

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:33.019
 what would it be there. 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:37.239
 We have a real camera that shoots you in your glasses 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:38.600
 on a green background 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.930
 and the only thing the game needs to know is where the virtual camera is supposed to be. 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.039
 We use HTC Vive glasses and the third handheld controller, 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.530
 assigned to the camera, 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.850
 allowing the game to know where the camera is. 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.519
 So we can have a real camera and a virtual camera, 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:00.929
 which moves through space and shoots video, 

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:03.360
 as if it were in a virtual reality with you. 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.230
 We have a top Intel processor on our computer 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.960
 32 gigabytes of RAM and the current peak in graphics cards, 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.310
 NVidii GTX 1080. 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.120
 The image is recorded in 4K, 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.110
 because anything smaller would cause problems. 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.870
 For mixed reality to work, 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:27.230
 we need to put a small configuration file into the game folder, 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.280
 in which we describe where the driver is assigned 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.210
 and where is the lens of our camera. 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.840
 We also need to align the rotation and field of view of the camera, 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.210
 but otherwise it should work with the current version of Unity. 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.030
 Unity is a tool that is often used to build 3D programs. 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:48.720
 Because there is this system built in, 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.040
 The Mixed Reality Laboratory works with lots of VR games. 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.780
 Not with all but with most of them. 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.920
 And because the position of the HTC Vive drivers is very accurate, 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.360
 we can do things like this close shot of a laser gun, 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.160
 which I just hold, hopefully. 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.960
 Maybe it's a Vive driver, 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.350
 but its position is more or less perfect. 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.470
 When playing in a normal virtual reality, 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.700
 the computer must only generate what you see in your glasses. 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.500
 For mixed reality, the computer still generates another look, 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.840
 namely the perspective of the third driver - the virtual camera. 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.480
 So, finally, we have four views instead of one. 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.780
 Four - first normal view of glasses, 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.480
 but also background and two layers in front of the player 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.420
 from a virtual camera point of view. 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.930
 One foreground layer is a normal image to be seen before the player 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.990
 and then a luma layer that helps remove all black space. 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.819
 The SteamVR plugin automatically recognizes what's in the background and foreground 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.850
 depending on where the glasses are. 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:56.270
 Everything between the glasses and the virtual camera is the foreground 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.100
 and everything behind the glasses is the background. 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.290
 In our studio we make the composition alive. 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.590
 This gives us a rough impression of what the final product will look like. 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.440
 The living composition is not completely dopilovanÃ¡, 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:14.110
 but we can use those four original views 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:18.620
 and produce a much more detailed composition by hand. 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.260
 Virtual studios are not new. 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:23.950
 For years, BBC has been using a similar thing in the election, 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.320
 but they have carefully prepared graphic elements, 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.440
 a lot of expensive equipment 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.470
 and moderators need to practice everything perfectly, otherwise it does not look good. 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.770
 And by replacing our glasses with the Helm of Justice, 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:40.580
 we get a brace show show from the nineties, Knightmare. 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.180
 So far, it has always been expensive, custom-built affairs, 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.830
 but they use technologies that can be obtained here. 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.300
 If you want to do this at home, 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.000
 you will need a large green background, 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.490
 maybe you could paint the walls! 

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:54.430
 You will need a very powerful computer, 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.080
 a camera that can send an image to a computer, 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.980
 the recording card and the third driver. 

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.590
 But if you have all these things, 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.790
 you can enjoy the mixed reality in the comfort of your home! 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.910
 Thanks to everyone on the YouTube site in New York and the Mixed Reality Lab. 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.830
 You can find out more about them in the links below the video. 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:17.720
 (Do you leave the impact?) 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.420
 (That's pretty ...!) 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:19.420
 Yeah, it's funny! 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:20.420
 So, and we have it! 

00:04:21.689 --> 00:04:22.310
 That is all!
