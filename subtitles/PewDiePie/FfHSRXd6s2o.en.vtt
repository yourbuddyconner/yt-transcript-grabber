00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.140
 Hello everyone 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.480
 Today we are going to challenge the LWIAY 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.300
 The most popular show on YouTube 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.480
 I will comment on the mystery you created. 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.315
 Supreme honor on YouTube 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.685
 Not just YouTube but the highest honor on the entire network 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.060
 If your fascination appears in this video 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.285
 You have no regrets in this life. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.820
 Let's take a look at more about Alinity's fans. 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:48.080
 We have not played yet 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.700
 Copyright 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.580
 This this 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.620
 Not bad, congratulations 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.635
 She.. "He must be thinking about another woman." 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.540
 He.. "Why is PewNews called PewNews but the show host is Gloria Borger?" 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.520
 China may use sea water to hide her submarine 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.420
 Pood's YouTube channel 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.100
 *No content (Content with Not become Conten't) 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.040
 Are you, are you, are you? 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.060
 *No original content (Original with Not become Origina't) 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.220
 This is original content 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.760
 The way I am above is original 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.940
 Here is the United States 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.660
 That's right, my favorite news site is Buzzfeed 2. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.260
 The authoritative website Buzzfeed 2 brings you inspiring information 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.980
 Of course 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.240
 Only the truth 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.500
 Is this PewDiePie? (left.. journalist right: Pual Logan) 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.340
 I don't know if you have read a report from Vancouver. 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:58.960
 Represented in the report 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.040
 I went to Japan’s "suicide forest" to photograph the body of a suicide. 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.815
 "Consider that PewDiePie is the most popular YouTuber on YouTube." 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:09.040
 "I went to the suicide forest in the original Aoki, Japan." 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.620
 "Photographed the body of a suicide" 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.920
 How can he do this? 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.740
 I hate PewDiePie 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.880
 When will he learn the lesson? 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.840
 Allinity.. "I have a black bloodline" 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:24.840
 It’s time to stop. 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.800
 I understand that everyone wants to get her attention. 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.320
 We have all put down 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.320
 No need to continue to make fun of her 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:35.720
 But this is very interesting 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.140
 Did you do it? 

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:38.960
 Done 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.680
 Then what price did you pay? 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.600
 399 dollars 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.360
 Have I ever talked about my chair? 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.220
 Where did it go? 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.340
 Where did it go? 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.060
 Thanos stole my chair 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.140
 A little obsessed with PewDiePie fans 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.080
 It’s a bit strange if you are obsessed with me. 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.180
 I am only nine years old. 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:07.220
 It’s time for my nine-year-old legion 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.280
 ABCD 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:14.940
 in the future 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.880
 We need to use hieroglyphics to understand this mystery 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:20.520
 This is too strange 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.980
 Escape from Thanos 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.400
 Fighting against Thanos 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.980
 Create a weapon that can kill Thanos 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.060
 Turn Thanos into a fan 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.720
 And kill the mess in the memo comment 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.240
 Someone has learned 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.400
 You combined Twitch Thots with the Wanlezhu Coke Fountain. 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.560
 Selling meat anchors for kinky 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.560
 Please, brothers. 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.980
 It’s time to let go 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.980
 "After reading the news commentary" 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.200
 "I decided to follow the seller on the left to sell the meat anchor." 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.380
 very good 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.500
 Congratulations 

00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.880
 what do you want 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.240
 If you don't have it, you want to reward. 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.040
 Eating PewDiePie's photo until he eats my photo 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.540
 Is he still going? 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.800
 He is still eating 喔

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.540
 Just $399 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.180
 Just $399 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.700
 Just give me $100 and I will eat. 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.880
 Or give me $200 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.380
 I won't tell you his channel name. 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.780
 Because YouTube will delete his channel again 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.500
 PUBG decides to file a copyright complaint against Fornite 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.000
 "Can we file a complaint under the Copyright Ordinance?" 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.900
 Can we file a copyright complaint against Fornite? 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.340
 Minister of health and health of belgium 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.100
 This is a joke to tease obese people. 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.315
 But very concealed, so no problem 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.340
 The mystery about Alinity continues to be hot 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.480
 I am now beginning to believe that my fans are nine-year-old children. 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.420
 well 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:06.020
 Thank you very much for seeing me finally. 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.660
 Everyone subscribes to my channel because I am not her 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.940
 do not worry 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.660
 PewDiePie's nine-year-old regiment will protect you 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.580
 Because you express your support for our monarch PewDiePie 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.700
 Who will protect me? 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.220
 Who will protect me? 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:29.240
 Like it 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.560
 If you agree with PewDiePie, rename his fans to "Nine-year-old boy" 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:33.820
 It is already 

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.620
 This is inevitable 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:44.580
 Now finally comes to the last page 

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:47.960
 Or you will find a more serious one. 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.160
 Will make me feel a little more comfortable 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.540
 Ok, this will be put on the first page. 

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.220
 Congratulations 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.760
 "My wife said that if a woman rules the world, there will be no war in the world." 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.920
 "I responded that this is for sure, because war requires strategy and logic." 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.200
 We need to write a story for this 

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:16.580
 This is a very obvious gender discrimination 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:19.440
 Too shameful 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.280
 Not only in my personal 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.080
 Is all women 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:23.500
 All women are queens 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.700
 Removing all the elements of the game that involve sexual harassment and insulting women, this is what we should do 

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.300
 I am PewDiePie. 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.900
 Gloria Borger 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.440
 She won't do this 

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:36.080
 She won't do this 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:37.720
 Her Twitter is too serious 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:40.440
 Maybe one day she will 

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:42.880
 Are you really planning to take over my YouTube channel? 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.580
 It seems that I have been replaced by people. 

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.160
 "Nine-year-old boy" has already made a decision. 

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:50.440
 I will be resigned 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:51.480
 Thank you all 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.860
 Thank you for your support in these eight years. 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:56.260
 Although this is a dull and vulgar channel 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.220
 But finally 

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:59.820
 Goodbye everyone 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:12.100
 (background: you will not die) 

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.060
 someone said 

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.920
 This is what is happening now 

00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:23.940
 At my graduation ceremony (on the hat.. but can you do it) 

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:26.940
 Someone painted PewDiePie on the graduation cap 

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.000
 is this real 

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.840
 This is not true 

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:33.640
 PewDiePie can file a copyright complaint against her. 

00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:36.940
 "I am wearing a PewDiePie peripheral product in a news report in New Zealand." 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.540
 Is it "nine-year-old boy"? 

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:47.140
 (I am very grateful to you, but we only met for the first time) 

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:48.600
 (so we are only friends) 

00:07:48.620 --> 00:07:49.520
 (really) 

00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.720
 (How long) 

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.500
 (I will tell you after the ad) 

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.560
 (really not bad) 

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.360
 This seems to be a news program. 

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.480
 Did we start to infiltrate into different media? 

00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:05.680
 well-done 

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.080
 PewDiePie's sweater is an embarrassing way to shake hands 

00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:11.340
 You are a real fan 

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.140
 "Nine-year-old boy" 

00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.800
 This is our genes and traditions 

00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.080
 We won't shake hands 

00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:34.180
 Let's take a look at another one. 

00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:35.800
 very good 

00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:40.600
 This has become an "Alinity and her enemy" channel 

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:41.960
 Another one 

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.640
 Another one 

00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:45.380
 Another compliment if you want (if you want ItsSkyLOL to report the weather in PewNews please like it) 

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:46.500
 What happened 

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:51.600
 Strongly requested to host PewNews by Marzia 

00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:53.420
 Very good Marzia is my queen 

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.220
 Watch the fans of the fans 

00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:04.720
 (Welcome to the most popular show on YouTube) 

00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:07.860
 What did you do? 

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:11.600
 (If you like the fans, please clapping) 

00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:15.660
 (If you want to ruin the fans, please clapping) 

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:18.220
 (if you like memes) 

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.680
 (And you want to let everyone appreciate it) 

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.660
 (If you want to ruin the mystery, please clapping 

00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:28.020
 (Comment memo is a program that is important to society) 

00:09:29.500 --> 00:09:31.540
 You are the best 

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.540
 I have a very serious bicycle accident. 

00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:37.260
 Basically the sternum is broken and the left lung collapses. 

00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:40.740
 Intrapulmonary hemorrhage can not move left hand 

00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.960
 This is the most stupid and outdated mystery I think of. 

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.960
 (Can you do this?) 

00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.520
 You are a strange group of nine-year-old children. 

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.460
 I do not know what to say 

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.820
 But this is really interesting 

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.880
 Madmax199932 I hope you will recover soon 

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.840
 Thank you for saving this mystery 

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.760
 If you all want to be part of the rescue mere 

00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:15.260
 Go and see SubReddit 

00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.780
 How to say in English to see SubReddit 

00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:20.440
 Then put your mystery on 

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.540
 Those interesting fans 

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.920
 I need a mess to relieve boredom. 

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:31.500
 Before normal 

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:34.440
 I will not host this show again. 

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:37.440
 Obviously I have been replaced 

00:10:37.460 --> 00:10:38.880
 Take it, ItsSkyLOL 

00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:44.940
 Hello everyone, I am ItsSkyLOL. 

00:10:44.940 --> 00:10:46.800
 I will host this show from now on. 

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.060
 Thanks to "Nine-year-old boy" 

00:10:48.060 --> 00:10:50.960
 Don't forget the LIKE piece 

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.160
 Still subscribe to this channel 

00:10:53.160 --> 00:10:54.520
 See you tomorrow
