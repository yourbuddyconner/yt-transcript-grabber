 F. (Voices Waaaao) 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.460
 New Collection Available It is a completely original design. 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:10.450
 (Laughter) 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.640
 You can finally embrace you work in a fast food restaurant 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.660
 All of them 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.120
 Wak Donalds It's a place to be 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.040
 Designed by me cheerful 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.320
 It has quality and the mart. 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.609
 It is a limited offer 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.440
 Enough dabbing. 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.700
 Let's start the video 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.060
 It's a video I wanted to do for a very long time. 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.320
 I want to see my most popular videos (dun dun dun sounds plays in background) 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.100
 I have not achieved in a very long time. 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.600
 It's one of those things 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.239
 I just do not look, it's inhabited in the past and I do not like to give you, the three whims of Budibay 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.740
 I know that I look stupid because I am ecstatic 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.660
 * Friday with pewdiepie * 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.940
 It's been some time since 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 is not it? English 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.000
 * Bridge sight when he said the N word 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 What a ...... 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.980
 * Laugh * 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.760
 Yes, I do not know if I love the third stage 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.190
 The thing is that I know that the most popular videos will be really old. You know what let's end this kind of 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:20.379
 Most of the most popular people connect a channel through the most popular videos, it's very clear. Funny montage 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.880
 83 million viewers, my God Shlank Ahmad Hadi 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.160
 I had no idea if I had guessed that I would say he got 40 million views. 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.900
 How do? 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.130
 Who is watching this and why? Five years ago? 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.890
 First of all, if something funny calls, it is not funny immediately. So this video should be great 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.059
 I feel like I'm stuck with this guy duck 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.589
 It makes me want to look like my God 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.400
 Oh. Oh. A tower will make a tower 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:51.680
 Go left. Yes that's right. 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:56.560
 This is not true we call this woman 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:58.660
 No. 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.280
 Catch him. 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.780
 Catch him! 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.080
 * Screaming like a girl * 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.640
 A good example of laughter equals really funny is there Felix. good job 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.630
 I love this game. This is really good 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.470
 Awesome you can not even see what you've done how you liked this 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.060
 Pulse sensor 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.060
 that's cool. This is very original 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.579
 I was always next to my side 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.120
 * Laugh * 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.100
 Oh, I remember this. 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.789
 Well, well, this one is still funny sure 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:01.559
 Why do you know what a man who looks so crazy and I look at me crazy 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:12.509
 Well, that's funny. It's kind of funny 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:18.360
 Many of it is crisp but I think why people think it's funny. The second most watched video is the level 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:21.370
 Level 7 of 

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:22.989
 Scaring PewDiePie 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:24.980
 53 million views 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.120
 Allah 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:28.420
 Nice and kind 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.300
 As cumbersome as these were to portray not only because of 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.769
 I'm trying to keep up with what's going on. But also the same supply as all these painful experiences passes through 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.569
 I always look back on it as really enjoyable memories. They were good times. it's a shame 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.469
 They put this as a loop free episode I think is one of the weakest 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:52.229
 I think just because it was the last person they thought would be cool 

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:59.160
 52 million hits for Ruby but he is one of those videos that Felix shaves like in the world? 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:04.709
 I remember the man who gave me that story. It was as if we were going to do something different. I'm like, well 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.739
 I do not know what it is 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:12.660
 This is very enjoyable. I really wanted to be just a channel packed. It would be that much fun. Oh 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:20.609
 I think there is nothing interesting here. We really just am glad we cut this for ten minutes 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:31.139
 We just look at the people who want to know what the prize for this funny video has been for video games for six years 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.820
 Damn, I think we're going here. Should we just leave Jeremy? What? Yes really 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:39.120
 Jeremy brings us these things, sir 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.580
 As he always wanted to be my dream with Oliver 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.360
 We ship PEWDS and CRY 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.940
 It was funny in general that I forgot it 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:08.719
 This is nice, I'm glad because I can honestly enjoy the wonderful bar 

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:12.679
 that is great. I thought I would just be just hilarious 

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.029
 Lock at the exit of the lab to say 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.910
 death is coming 

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.460
 you do not know 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.150
 It's like a moderately funny timing click 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:33.020
 Donate montage or whatever. I do not know. I think I ended up here Jim Bob. Oh, this was soon 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.230
 Stop 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:38.540
 Someone is there 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:47.908
 Like I took the chair with me too 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.729
 They are not a very bad thing that makes me wish to get it now 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:06:01.769
 you are right. you are right. You're right all the time. I think people look at this montage and they know, it's an excerpt 

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.259
 It's a three-second clip if you make a funny montage now. Oh boy. Oh boy 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.600
 You are very happy 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:16.180
 I remember this. 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.260
 What is this dude laugh. 

00:06:24.909 --> 00:06:28.199
 You really are not funny next time we had a glove bird 

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:35.728
 I remember playing this game and immediately after it exploded completely. I did not even play bird glove in this video. 

00:06:37.149 --> 00:06:44.489
 I played stupid ways of dying, and it's also an amazing game, but then, I play my game Flyby Bird 

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:48.539
 I changed the title and thumbnail to Flappy Bird and 

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:54.809
 Here you are. Boom 35 million views Thank you Felix. You are the next greedy bastard 

00:06:54.809 --> 00:07:00.509
 We have the video where I said, I will delete my channel. Bigger is just a joke bro in history 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:05.968
 I did not think anyone would believe me. I did not think people would be like, my God, would he actually do that? 

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:11.759
 I do not even remember at least why I can not remember why I remember remembering in the headless space 

00:07:11.759 --> 00:07:17.158
 I was really fed up with being in this position. I was two months before the disaster 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:20.338
 I did not like being the biggest channel. Dislike 

00:07:21.249 --> 00:07:23.249
 He has paid great attention to me 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:28.979
 I have often said that I am just a small channel so I can do my own and 

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:31.589
 Literally no one cares 

00:07:32.019 --> 00:07:33.879
 I also never asked to be in this position 

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:39.509
 I really felt like I could not actually delete my channel and just start a new one at the time 

00:07:39.509 --> 00:07:41.518
 I was working with a lot of different people, you know 

00:07:41.519 --> 00:07:46.259
 I had companies and things like that. I knew that if my channel was true, it would be huge 

00:07:47.289 --> 00:07:49.289
 Repurcourse of 

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:56.560
 Other people even knew II that I could not do that but I was honestly thinking that he was afraid of PewDiePie did not come out anyway 

00:07:56.560 --> 00:07:58.560
 so you know. 

00:07:58.580 --> 00:08:04.179
 I could have just done it I should just do. damn it. Next. We have a lot of my life video 

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:06.970
 I got the first optional admission from the university and 

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.520
 Everything looked fine. I 

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:12.190
 Began to become more creative 

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.420
 This is really not a good video that I feel I can do better 

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:21.239
 Then we literally have Paul Jake and Paul Logan 

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:26.189
 I think people hear a lot about Jake and Logan 

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:28.380
 We had a bouffist from Rumi 

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.970
 So when you load every day if anyone comes to you and say hey 

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:36.809
 I can get a covered video for today. Yes please 

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:37.470
 Yes really 

00:08:37.470 --> 00:08:42.089
 I will take it and come to "Rumi" with this song that made him spend long 

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:49.290
 On this song and did a great job on it. So I mean to get free views. Roomie gets great exposure 

00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:54.269
 He is a talented man. I had nothing to do with it. Literally nothing 

00:09:04.990 --> 00:09:06.990
 It's a really good song 

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:17.870
 No, the electric oath is a challenge 

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:21.950
 Impossible game Title Good Felix, very good title 

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:28.429
 This actually hurts by the way, it really hurts. Do not use this for your own kids. I almost said 

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.370
 Do not use it on your pets and your kids. Oh 

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.810
 Look at me I almost cry 

00:09:40.140 --> 00:09:42.440
 This is a strange period in YouTube where 

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.140
 * Think about Felix * 

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:51.880
 Punishment and video games were one way or another common trend like chili or hot sauce if you or you died 

00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:57.289
 We will do all these challenges. It's just as I'm happy because the trend is over 

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:02.089
 Well, because it was not fun. This video got demonetized fanatics 

00:10:03.150 --> 00:10:05.150
 damn it 

00:10:05.550 --> 00:10:08.900
 It is a wonderful video that I will not introduce. You should see it 

00:10:09.330 --> 00:10:16.219
 Basically it's me and Brad Pitt posting at their best then of course trying not to laugh challenge 

00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:21.979
 So, seven months ago a year ago six months ago 

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:28.279
 So there are a lot of the latter. It's just the best 

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:35.479
 Such a long time ago, this is really enjoyable. I really enjoyed really reflecting a bit on the past and 

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.390
 Not necessarily just wriggling 

00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:45.920
 An impending bold way I felt that this is the most popular video clips. Have you reviewed them yet? What do you think? 

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.760
 * Re-pewdiepie old. I prefer old Pio 

00:10:49.180 --> 00:10:50.920
 I also trust me, too 

00:10:51.839 --> 00:10:53.779
 I think I want to be like this, huh? 

00:10:53.779 --> 00:11:00.799
 It is interesting that you have a form that observes the difference that everyone changes, but it is nice to see 

00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:03.390
 It's good that 

00:11:03.390 --> 00:11:10.039
 See some growth and some change in a positive way, but not only completely dislike your past. I do not know 

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:12.409
 It's great like eight years is a long time. 

00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:18.770
 I'm lucky to stay here and think about it all the time. So thanks to everyone. I keep channel support 

00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.020
 Frankly, I will not be here without you and 

00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:24.320
 Also 

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.749
 Double Thank you if you buy this store. Well, you're supposed to do it, okay 

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:31.329
 I spend a lot of time in it, please. thank you 

00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:34.840
 It got Walmart quality. Good-bye 

00:11:35.100 --> 00:11:36.840
 * ASS outro got everyone * 

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.960
 Seriously who makes the first translations? 

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.580
 Of course the nine-year-old 

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:43.480
 Then the elderly to clean up the mess. 

00:11:44.100 --> 00:11:45.220
 jeez Please do this correctly. We do not pay them a clean mess. 

00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:46.320
