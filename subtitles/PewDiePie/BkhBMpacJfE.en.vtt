00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Oooo 

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 Hey he pewdiepie 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.015
 Best UiBoR to date 

00:00:06.015 --> 00:00:08.165
 I have more followers 

00:00:08.165 --> 00:00:09.905
 Today we will talk about broadcasters 

00:00:10.495 --> 00:00:13.125
 Direct broadcast errors "Haha" 

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:16.215
 The thing I liked about live broadcast errors 

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:19.165
 Precisely it does not matter 

00:00:19.165 --> 00:00:21.995
 One error, OK, one error and spoil the whole thing 

00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:25.135
 He's high on the internet forever, and you'll regret it 

00:00:25.135 --> 00:00:27.415
 Now I have not made any mistakes 

00:00:27.415 --> 00:00:29.645
 I will not be so stupid 

00:00:30.295 --> 00:00:32.235
 To do any error 

00:00:32.755 --> 00:00:36.055
 Such as a pornographic film show 

00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:36.555
 "Mission Failed" 

00:00:37.055 --> 00:00:37.555
 first video 

00:00:37.555 --> 00:00:38.315
 I adore this video 

00:00:38.315 --> 00:00:41.215
 I adore this video a lot 

00:00:41.215 --> 00:00:41.840
 It's my favorite 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.175
 It's this girl who broadcasts "live broadcast" 

00:00:44.175 --> 00:00:47.155
 Which is used to use the "WALKHAK" 

00:00:47.155 --> 00:00:49.675
 And other programs for hacking and using Hack 

00:00:49.675 --> 00:00:51.540
 Without knowing that the broadcast is under way 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.155
 That the martyrs see 

00:00:52.155 --> 00:00:53.925
 They see it using software 

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:57.305
 Let's watch 

00:00:57.505 --> 00:01:00.265
 Oooh and Oooooooooo what is this! 

00:01:01.765 --> 00:01:02.765
 The dreaded 

00:01:12.595 --> 00:01:14.855
 She honestly does not just deny it 

00:01:14.855 --> 00:01:17.860
 Very good in the game so much so she sees the health column automatically 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.015
 And through the walls 

00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:23.665
 These women are good at games 

00:01:23.785 --> 00:01:24.785
 They can not help it 

00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:25.715
 Why did you prepare for hell? 

00:01:27.175 --> 00:01:29.175
 That's right, why are you packing? 

00:01:29.175 --> 00:01:29.675
 I think this was the problem 

00:01:31.865 --> 00:01:34.935
 Thank you very much Welcome to the empire My name is Miss "q gamiri" 

00:01:34.935 --> 00:01:36.995
 The Empire 

00:01:37.575 --> 00:01:40.445
 Frankly it bothers me that I speak this image 

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:42.760
 Because I used to be a member of this empire 

00:01:44.135 --> 00:01:47.075
 My favorite empire 

00:01:49.765 --> 00:01:53.215
 We try not to be weak 

00:01:54.305 --> 00:01:56.805
 Using "Hack" 

00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:01.585
 I try not to be weak in this game 

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:03.205
 So I'm pretty good at it "because you use the hack" 

00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:08.085
 How to collect donations is not explicit 

00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:11.595
 Of people 

00:02:11.595 --> 00:02:14.405
 By cheating in the game 

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:17.355
 It bothers me a lot when cheating in the game 

00:02:17.355 --> 00:02:19.225
 Oooh, you know what !! Retake my words 

00:02:19.225 --> 00:02:22.305
 I would rather respect cheating in the game if .. 

00:02:22.305 --> 00:02:25.245
 Disturb people 

00:02:25.245 --> 00:02:30.695
 Their envy, somewhat understand it but when cheat to show that you are good 

00:02:30.695 --> 00:02:33.705
 So just "stupid" 

00:02:33.705 --> 00:02:36.455
 I can not stand this irony 

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:39.235
 From today and tomorrow 

00:02:40.355 --> 00:02:43.335
 But my favorite part is when her colleagues reveal it 

00:02:43.335 --> 00:02:46.655
 She tries to blame her friend for it 

00:02:49.395 --> 00:02:51.005
 Look at her face 

00:02:53.885 --> 00:02:56.885
 Yoo, friends do you show any strange mistake 

00:02:58.715 --> 00:03:02.045
 Biodebay: Yoo, do you show that strange mistake? 

00:03:02.245 --> 00:03:03.245
 When you see through the walls 

00:03:03.855 --> 00:03:04.855
 For two full rounds 

00:03:06.495 --> 00:03:06.995
 And not to ignore it, 

00:03:06.995 --> 00:03:07.625
 But 

00:03:12.135 --> 00:03:15.295
 Trying to act subject XD 

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.395
 I played the day before 

00:03:17.715 --> 00:03:20.325
 I played the day before! 

00:03:20.325 --> 00:03:22.325
 And now I have it 

00:03:22.325 --> 00:03:22.825
 I do not know 

00:03:23.225 --> 00:03:26.445
 He must have a virus somehow, proved himself 

00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:28.405
 And you just did not see him 

00:03:28.405 --> 00:03:30.385
 Girl: It's weird at Bidebay: Yeah it's weird 

00:03:31.805 --> 00:03:33.365
 Ahh, wait what the hell 

00:03:33.815 --> 00:03:36.265
 Biodebee: Uh, what the hell is this, OK? 

00:03:36.265 --> 00:03:38.205
 Excuse number 2, please tell me 

00:03:38.755 --> 00:03:40.245
 Girl: Clara Biodebay: Clara !! "Sarcastically" 

00:03:42.715 --> 00:03:45.565
 Clara damned, I was telling you friends about her 

00:03:45.565 --> 00:03:48.965
 For a long time, damn Clara can not be trusted 

00:03:49.585 --> 00:03:50.980
 What to do !! Girl: Wait Clara 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.555
 Give me again 

00:03:52.555 --> 00:03:55.385
 Biodebee: Ok girl: What is this? 

00:03:55.385 --> 00:03:58.355
 Girl: Hi Rock I want to help you because I do not know what to look at now * 

00:03:58.355 --> 00:03:59.355
 Girl: What the hell is this 

00:04:00.585 --> 00:04:02.155
 Girl: I want to talk to my girlfriend 

00:04:03.945 --> 00:04:06.755
 I was in my house the day before 

00:04:06.755 --> 00:04:09.775
 Biodipai: I liked Clara's comment this video Clara: I'm sorry 

00:04:09.775 --> 00:04:12.725
 Yoo Rock! Do you remember when 

00:04:12.725 --> 00:04:14.745
 When Clara is damned 

00:04:14.745 --> 00:04:17.360
 Will kill this girl * Yasatar * 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:18.900
 I was promised that she would not use this computer 

00:04:19.675 --> 00:04:22.845
 Was here today and I was watching it * trying to act subject * 

00:04:22.895 --> 00:04:25.785
 This is what happens when you make people use your computer 

00:04:25.785 --> 00:04:28.035
 I can not trust them 

00:04:28.035 --> 00:04:31.195
 Biodebay: It's very offensive to Clara, and now this damned girl 

00:04:31.195 --> 00:04:32.305
 Girl: I think 

00:04:33.035 --> 00:04:35.655
 Girl: I think this is all Biodebay: What's this! 

00:04:36.955 --> 00:04:38.245
 Girl: Now I'll get out 

00:04:38.725 --> 00:04:41.275
 Now my worst fear of live streaming is .. 

00:04:41.275 --> 00:04:43.205
 Keep the broadcast from not knowing you 

00:04:43.205 --> 00:04:45.915
 And later do something bad 

00:04:45.915 --> 00:04:49.215
 Something you should not do, something not Christian 

00:04:49.215 --> 00:04:52.215
 And all the people see, but this girl 

00:04:52.215 --> 00:04:55.235
 Clearly this is falsified 

00:04:55.235 --> 00:04:58.315
 It is very obvious when you see it 

00:04:59.905 --> 00:05:00.975
 Girl: I think 

00:05:01.715 --> 00:05:04.295
 Girl: I think that's all, I'll go .. 

00:05:04.295 --> 00:05:07.615
 pewdiepie: .. Yes I think that's all, I am 

00:05:07.615 --> 00:05:09.725
 I will go away 

00:05:10.865 --> 00:05:12.155
 Girl: I'll log out now 

00:05:13.095 --> 00:05:14.095
 Girl: And 

00:05:14.995 --> 00:05:17.765
 Girl: I will rest and I will sleep a good sleep 

00:05:17.965 --> 00:05:20.795
 Biodebay: I'll go away 

00:05:20.795 --> 00:05:23.635
 I will sleep a comfortable sleep 

00:05:23.635 --> 00:05:26.855
 And nothing, I will go and sleep! 

00:05:26.865 --> 00:05:29.875
 I do not watch the broadcast 

00:05:29.875 --> 00:05:32.365
 Biodebay: No masturbation 

00:05:32.705 --> 00:05:33.705
 Girl: You guys 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.520
 Ooh, wait I've noticed that this video request confirmation is age 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.940
 That means if you publish what happened .. 

00:05:39.945 --> 00:05:42.955
 My video will ask to confirm my age too, damn it 

00:05:42.955 --> 00:05:45.705
 You can see it yourself the girl returns and play another game 

00:05:45.705 --> 00:05:46.805
 silence 

00:05:49.615 --> 00:05:52.645
 Ook but it's not just for women of course! 

00:05:52.645 --> 00:05:53.645
 We have 

00:05:55.495 --> 00:05:57.115
 This is a classic too! 

00:06:02.265 --> 00:06:04.715
 This video did not ask confirm the age though 

00:06:06.205 --> 00:06:09.185
 It's just funny when young people do it 

00:06:09.185 --> 00:06:12.365
 Hello everyone how are you welcome 

00:06:12.875 --> 00:06:14.105
 Ooh that the camera envisions 

00:06:15.055 --> 00:06:17.975
 Look at the signal of his face 

00:06:22.505 --> 00:06:23.505
 Ooh Camera Visualization 

00:06:24.325 --> 00:06:27.755
 Hallelujah Did you see if you saw all this 

00:06:30.435 --> 00:06:32.315
 Learn what, live streaming is not so bad 

00:06:32.315 --> 00:06:34.265
 It's not as bad things happen 

00:06:34.265 --> 00:06:37.145
 Wait! The invasion of houses was recorded with the camera 

00:06:37.145 --> 00:06:40.115
 What ! Where people live in hell 

00:06:40.485 --> 00:06:41.485
 what a hell 

00:06:45.675 --> 00:06:46.675
 Biodepi: Oh my god 

00:06:48.625 --> 00:06:49.845
 My God 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.020
 The music is great too 

00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:56.480
 Masoudi Maideri about the one who entered the house 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.740
 Do you know the name of the song? 

00:07:02.795 --> 00:07:04.095
 I like the rhythm of music 

00:07:10.485 --> 00:07:11.485
 very good 

00:07:15.035 --> 00:07:17.655
 I'm joking, I hope you're fine, I think it's okay 

00:07:17.655 --> 00:07:19.465
 I filmed a video after that 

00:07:19.465 --> 00:07:22.165
 At that time I did not know what was happening 

00:07:22.165 --> 00:07:25.095
 They should have gone to the house next to me 

00:07:25.095 --> 00:07:28.315
 They're probably behind the Utopiaar I think they're behind the money 

00:07:28.315 --> 00:07:29.775
 It was very close 

00:07:30.605 --> 00:07:33.595
 I think the car was very fast, I guess 

00:07:33.595 --> 00:07:37.095
 I'm going to check 

00:07:37.315 --> 00:07:39.935
 Maybe it's better if you bring a gun 

00:07:40.225 --> 00:07:43.205
 Where is Nirvana, where is she? 

00:07:45.645 --> 00:07:47.985
 This section somewhat bothers me 

00:07:47.985 --> 00:07:50.445
 Because I do not really know what is going on there 

00:07:50.445 --> 00:07:52.685
 But there was an incident and shooting in the neighborhood 

00:07:52.685 --> 00:07:55.375
 It is just like giving me Nirvana and the pistol 

00:07:55.945 --> 00:07:58.475
 Is this stupid did not hear the process of "raging" 

00:07:58.475 --> 00:08:01.625
 Please, if you have a gun next to you you will be injured 

00:08:01.755 --> 00:08:03.395
 It's a very stupid idea 

00:08:03.895 --> 00:08:06.765
 Hold a pistol next to you during live broadcasts 

00:08:08.895 --> 00:08:12.005
 Right? Am I the only one who thinks so 

00:08:12.005 --> 00:08:14.565
 There is that audio file that represents .. 

00:08:14.565 --> 00:08:17.475
 Really as someone hits the door next to you 

00:08:17.475 --> 00:08:19.965
 If you have headphones you will feel 100 percent 

00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:22.965
 Click here and you do this and look there 

00:08:22.965 --> 00:08:25.425
 Then click here a bit 

00:08:25.425 --> 00:08:28.075
 It's really like someone hitting the door there 

00:08:28.075 --> 00:08:30.745
 It is a very real example 

00:08:30.745 --> 00:08:33.575
 Some people abuse and annoy them 

00:08:34.535 --> 00:08:37.065
 The reaction is just, very funny! 

00:08:40.535 --> 00:08:43.435
 It's like the truth 

00:08:43.440 --> 00:08:45.160
 Believe that one knock the door on him 

00:08:45.260 --> 00:08:48.285
 But this person directly brings the gun 

00:08:48.285 --> 00:08:50.345
 If I had a gun by my side to throw it away from me 

00:08:52.435 --> 00:08:54.435
 Why everyone has a pistol at all 

00:08:55.515 --> 00:08:57.235
 Damn ya man 

00:08:57.765 --> 00:09:00.775
 Do you want to be injured? I do not understand you, man 

00:09:01.345 --> 00:09:04.335
 He knew they were clicking on him 

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:05.575
 You have hidden me, man 

00:09:11.775 --> 00:09:12.775
 Look at him 

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.640
 He has a gun next to him! Hey man you're in a live broadcast you can not do this! 

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.895
 I do not know why he bothers me 

00:09:19.895 --> 00:09:22.625
 Have you not seen what happened to this person? 

00:09:22.625 --> 00:09:25.665
 He had an injury between the eyes 

00:09:29.965 --> 00:09:32.505
 O my God, man, why should I tell the people? 

00:09:32.685 --> 00:09:34.955
 To do it correctly, oh my God! 

00:09:34.955 --> 00:09:37.445
 Let's finish with this 

00:09:37.445 --> 00:09:39.335
 This may be one of my favorites 

00:09:40.335 --> 00:09:42.375
 Because it is very suspicious 

00:09:43.085 --> 00:09:45.895
 This girl .. 

00:09:45.895 --> 00:09:49.015
 I think the video here she was playing "Darc Sluss" 

00:09:49.015 --> 00:09:52.055
 You can see the giant window there 

00:09:52.075 --> 00:09:55.145
 And she was drunk and drank 

00:09:55.145 --> 00:09:56.920
 for some reason 

00:09:57.285 --> 00:09:59.285
 I do not know, I want to know why I did not understand 

00:09:59.955 --> 00:10:02.775
 I decided to broadcast the broadcast 

00:10:02.785 --> 00:10:04.715
 And walk astray 

00:10:05.355 --> 00:10:07.135
 Using the infirmary 

00:10:07.355 --> 00:10:09.805
 This is something I do not understand 

00:10:10.745 --> 00:10:13.715
 First Shi, seeing a girl walking down stairs 

00:10:14.975 --> 00:10:17.985
 He's not very attractive, OK 

00:10:17.985 --> 00:10:20.735
 It's not always like, "Oh my god" 

00:10:20.735 --> 00:10:23.505
 I can see a little of that ass 

00:10:23.505 --> 00:10:25.765
 It is not so rude 

00:10:25.765 --> 00:10:28.805
 I understand they can do it in live broadcasts 

00:10:33.485 --> 00:10:36.725
 I sort of understand it, but walk the stairs 

00:10:36.725 --> 00:10:39.940
 Not so rude, not sexy 

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.880
 But the thing here is that it's not just walking down the stairs 

00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.900
 She walks using the infirmary 

00:10:45.905 --> 00:10:48.485
 This is just not exciting 

00:10:48.485 --> 00:10:51.535
 You look like a lagging behind, what are you doing! 

00:10:51.540 --> 00:10:52.540
 why are you doing this! 

00:10:55.680 --> 00:10:58.160
 If you watch this broadcast 

00:10:58.380 --> 00:11:01.640
 I would say that is a girl with special needs 

00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:05.000
 Are you trying to show us how difficult it is 

00:11:08.715 --> 00:11:10.485
 Is this really everything? 

00:11:13.615 --> 00:11:15.615
 How can they think? 

00:11:15.615 --> 00:11:16.115
 Put a camera here 

00:11:16.340 --> 00:11:21.140
 People will see me climb up 

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.180
 How does that have any logic, I do not understand! 

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.200
 I am very puzzled, but you continue to do so 

00:11:29.205 --> 00:11:32.545
 Because of her friend "Soda Door" 

00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.820
 Is this fake! 

00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:38.975
 But I enjoy it a lot! 

00:11:40.505 --> 00:11:42.125
 He enters like an angry man 

00:11:57.775 --> 00:11:59.955
 How do I know that 

00:12:00.435 --> 00:12:02.545
 I hope you will reconcile 

00:12:02.545 --> 00:12:05.565
 I hope they solved their problems 

00:12:05.565 --> 00:12:08.615
 In any case this is my best favorite mistake 

00:12:08.615 --> 00:12:11.615
 I have a lot of mistakes, but I think the time we implemented 

00:12:11.615 --> 00:12:14.385
 Not really, but we made it 10 minutes 

00:12:14.385 --> 00:12:15.635
 It's time to go 

00:12:15.635 --> 00:12:17.745
 Play some games 

00:12:17.745 --> 00:12:20.465
 Thanks for watching 

00:12:20.465 --> 00:12:23.185
 And the grip of the sisters, and I will see you tomorrow 

00:12:23.185 --> 00:12:25.415
 In another video
