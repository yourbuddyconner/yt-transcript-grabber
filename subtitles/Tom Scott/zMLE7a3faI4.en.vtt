00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:03.190
 Welcome back to "War", I am Tom Scott. 

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.009
 I am David Bodycombe. 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:06.759
 The game to be played today is our first knockout 

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:09.209
 One of them will be eliminated today. 

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:10.630
 What are you going to play today? 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.660
 Digital warfare called "black hole" 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.009
 Both players will take turns to place digital cards 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:17.680
 Start with 1, then 2, 3 all the way to 10 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:20.600
 There will be a space at the end of the game, and that is 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:21.720
 We are talking about "black holes," 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.220
 It will suck in the digital cards distributed around it. 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.300
 The party with the smaller sum of the numbers sucked in is the winner. 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.240
 Simple rule 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.439
 Ok, let's see how they behave. 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.039
 Ok, it seems that I am the first attack. let me see 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.920
 In fact, I haven’t figured out that the first strike is not dominant. 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.049
 Anyway, I don't have any good strategy, so just... 

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:43.220
 You might think that the first attacker 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.580
 Predominate, but in fact 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:48.860
 When they reached the final step, the attacking side 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.619
 There are two spaces to choose from 

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:53.409
 Therefore, the attack has the right to decide the outcome of the game. 

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.629
 That's right, so if you choose the first attack, you have to make sure 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:58.470
 The last two spaces left 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.280
 Will be the most beneficial to you 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.860
 I think this is very difficult. 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.920
 I got it 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.980
 Which side are you more optimistic about, the player is still a mathematician? 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.140
 In a way, I am more optimistic about players. 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.350
 Because the way they think usually leads the situation a few steps 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.160
 Impromptu play is my strategy 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.190
 Improvisation, I don’t think improvisation is a strategy 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.620
 I still imitate you first. 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.140
 Ah, imitate! Great strategy 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.540
 This trick is easy to confuse the opponent 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.390
 How many tricks do you have to confuse your opponent? ! 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.560
 Hey, are you referring to broken pieces? 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.360
 Maybe! 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.500
 Oh, you know what we think? 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.470
 Is imitating tactics a good idea? 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:32.610
 I think it’s not bad. 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.820
 But if it is me, I won’t put a corner. 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.030
 Because the corner creates a black hole, only two numbers will be sucked in. 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.150
 But at the beginning, it’s not bad to be in front of each other like this. 

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.860
 Indeed, it seems reasonable to focus on small numbers in the middle. 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.390
 Because there are more spaces around, it also represents 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.390
 The probability of generating black holes is also high. 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.920
 So you have to concentrate the small numbers in the middle. 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:57.900
 This game is not simple. 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.840
 Look at Emma's face. 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:01.900
 You are crazy! 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.400
 Good chess (whisper) 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.030
 I will start when the game is here. 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.760
 Look for places where black holes may be created, 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.520
 Then calculate the sum of the surrounding numbers 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.780
 That's right, but I am right now 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.460
 The distribution of spaces is so full of interest. 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.670
 Soon, our game has come to an end. 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.610
 I don't really like the point under Katie. 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.780
 Because that makes her blue chess piece across the entire chessboard 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.330
 (Blue) A little too much exposure. And there are other 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.910
 The place will make her lose very badly. 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.230
 I always feel that no matter how I put it, I will lose very badly! 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.720
 I have a whole tactical mistake, it seems that improvisation is really... 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:50.740
 Not a good tactic 

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:54.530
 It seems that Emma puts the numbers together to prevent them from being exposed to black holes. 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.510
 That's right, she has 3 and 7 in addition to the top right corner. 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.250
 Nothing to worry about 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.319
 really? Yeah, other places 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.630
 Katie’s total number is bigger than her, even 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:08.280
 There are several places that are basically flat 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.099
 That's right, if she puts 8 in this prime location between 7 and 3, 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:14.239
 It means that her eyes are really good. 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.069
 Oh, oh 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.340
 That's not bad, she can... 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.420
 It seems that she is now trying to fill it up. 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.890
 Ha, Katie actually helped her fill the hole! 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:34.000
 Sensible judgment, which forced her to put the numbers that were supposed to be there somewhere else. 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.670
 This is the second time that Emma is not between 7 and 3. 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.040
 Because that is her weakness? 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:41.980
 Yes, her weakness. Then she should want to... 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.629
 Emma will (air) 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:45.530
 I can clearly feel the heartbeat 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.180
 That's right, I don't know why I care (winning and losing)! 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.880
 Who is just saying, "Is it serious to lose?" 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:56.069
 Trap, traps everywhere 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.830
 I can't predict the next move, although I will play chess but... 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:59.980
 I can't help with this game. 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.420
 This game is basically her (Emma) won, right? 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.410
 No accidents 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.319
 what! Not there! 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.510
 Because now there are her 7, 3 and 9 around, but Katie's 

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.430
 Not much blue 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.220
 No! One step wrong, step by step wrong 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:16.569
 Not quite right, so Emma can put her 10 into it. 

00:04:16.569 --> 00:04:21.109
 The remaining two holes on the left, regardless of which Katie's 10 are placed, will be counted. 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.819
 Look, the game is over. 

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:26.939
 That's right. Katie must put 10 on the side, okay the game is over. 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.860
 Emma Congratulations! 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.320
 This game is too brain-intensive! 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.860
 Moreover, this game is the kind of "authority is not necessarily confused, 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.240
 One of the kind of games that bystanders think they are clear 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:38.159
 The message below the movie will probably look like: 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:39.409
 "How come you stupid to be there!" 

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:41.949
 Yes, really, I think I just got the 9 and almost messed up. 

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:43.969
 I wanted to say at the time: "How can I do this?" 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:45.120
 Ha, I will still win. 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.259
 Emma's next game is supposed to be a play-off 

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:49.680
 However, her game should be in the last few games. 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.500
 And before that was Steven’s final against Hannah. 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.740
 What games do they want to play? 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.659
 They are going to play the psychological warfare 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:01.759
 Hey, so play a psychological war with the magician? 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.220
 I think it will be very interesting. 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.620
