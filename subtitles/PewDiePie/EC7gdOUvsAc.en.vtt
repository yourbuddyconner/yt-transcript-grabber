00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
 I am so excited today~~~ 

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:04.620
 because... 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.620
 We have to see... just you and me... 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.140
 I have always been a favorite stream live clip 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.200
 This thing is painful... I can't stand it anymore ( ́∀`) 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.020
 But then you know that this is the best (&gt;∀&lt;) 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.980
 The main point of stream is... 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.060
 Once the content is broadcast... 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.520
 Can never be deleted 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.300
 ( ́∀`) 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.360
 This is the essence of the place 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.960
 I am super anxious when I broadcast live on the stream... 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.240
 Will accidentally say what is wrong with what is wrong 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:34.180
 People also attack me 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.760
 Let's just laugh at other people's sly moves (・∀・) 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.070
 ( ́∀`) 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.260
 Ok, so this is the live broadcast of the 2014 fast game summer marathon. 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.400
 Tomba! 2's fast clearance 

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:48.560
 *game* 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.380
 It’s amazing to have a quick look. 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.940
 Don't get me wrong! I think it's really fun to get through the customs. 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.040
 Swan, my camera is gone. 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.980
 Don't get me wrong, I don't come to the acid fast. 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:15.400
 People doing things in a limited time make people feel interesting and impressive. 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.340
 Because Jesus Christ, I am joking. 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.400
 Let me talk back to the film. 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.880
 I am pretty sure that the above is "Autism" (it writes "art") 

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.520
 Because the people who make this are very ingenious 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.000
 * looks... pretty fun* 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.740
 So we have... 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.180
 Cavemen who has a beard 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.100
 and also... 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:32.120
 *belch* 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.860
 Next to him is Chibi himself sitting on the sofa during the fast clearance. 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.080
 Imagine now... 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:42.540
 Imagine playing the same game over and over again. 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.740
 Again and again and again 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.540
 Desperately playing 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.100
 It’s time... 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.780
 This is your only mastery skill 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.180
 Also the only talent acquired 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.060
 It is also the only talent in this life. 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.920
 Don't misunderstand, so imagine what you did... 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.280
 This is the moment when the light is glowing. 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.280
 It’s time to show your ability... 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.140
 Then this little bastard Chibi 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.180
 Sitting next to you without stealing your focus 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:09.260
 Let’s see 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.960
 *Hello everyone, I am Caveman DCJ* 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.520
 *This game is called Tomba! 2* 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.040
 *Good start 喔* 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.200
 Chibi: *The plot is more abundant than the big stupid cat...* 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.920
 So Chibi is trying... 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.920
 Don't let the atmosphere cool down... I am also very understanding of what he is doing. 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.920
 The first Chibi is the only one... 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.180
 ( ́∀`) 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.360
 I like Chibi is the only one with legs open. 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.220
 He is definitely the focus on this sofa. 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.100
 But Caveman is not 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.180
 *I usually wear wide trousers* 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:40.140
 *But I wear jeans today* 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.340
 *Are you not dressed up for this occasion today* 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.980
 *I don't have an* 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.800
 *Well, I don't have * *I don't have A* 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.480
 *I recommend people who are watching to buy a cup of coffee* 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.820
 *May add another bagel* 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.460
 * Dude, I love Bego* 

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.560
 * Sit down and watch Tomba with breakfast* 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.000
 *You have cheese beans* 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.860
 *好ㄘ~~* 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:57.880
 *I think too * 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.580
 ( ́∀`) 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.420
 "Brother, I love Bego." 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.940
 "Fashion" 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.460
 "I think too" 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.100
 We are almost just beginning with Caveman and can’t stand Chibi anymore. 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.060
 We all met people who felt that they knew everything. 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.760
 I don’t know what I’m talking about. 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.460
 Chibi is such a person (・∀・)b 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.340
 *The character design of this game* 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.140
 *Let me think of Takahashi Celebrity's Adventure Island* 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.260
 *Sure...* 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.860
 You know a little social...hey... 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.300
 Little brother class of your brother Pewdiepie 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.380
 Ultimate...socialism 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.940
 I mean... 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:39.860
 I mean the ultimate social citizen (?) 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.920
 If most of the conversations are you doing 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.600
 Most of the responses from people who talk to you are mostly 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.580
 "Sure" 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:48.540
 "Uh 哼" 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.640
 "Ok" 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.020
 This probably means that they are not interested in what you are saying. 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.780
 You should also ask them questions. 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.660
 I know 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:58.700
 I understand it. 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.940
 I can master the art of social skills (`ω ́)b 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.400
 *Well, we have 20 bucks from Iniffy* 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.360
 *This is 20 yuan to get it, maybe it will be very useful* 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.380
 Swan 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:12.020
 * We also have 5...* 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.680
 *laugh* 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.500
 *Don't be good because I like to go back to the darts* 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.720
 *awkward* 

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:17.520
 *Back to Dart Addiction?* 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.900
 * Addiction? * (More provoke...) 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.920
 God, Chibi, how are you? 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:27.080
 My brother Chibi’s talk show is excellent. 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.180
 Fast response 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.580
 I saw you know 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.800
 *So there is a crab here. Is this a good thing* (crab also refers to a grumpy person) 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.800
 *Yeah...* 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.140
 That super humorous ( ́∀`) 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.820
 Good brother Chibi! Yeah~~ 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:42.940
 Crab is a good thing ∀(^∀^) 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:49.160
 You see how happy he is, why he always laughs. 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:52.160
 *I haven't seen crabs that can be used like this* 

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.560
 ...... 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.560
 *You will not see it in the future* 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.360
 * This part of the game crab is over* 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:00.940
 * rest in peace with crabs* 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.820
 I hope that your part will also end Chibi. 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.980
 I am joking, don't be serious!!! 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.320
 *Like it~ Speed ​​up pants* 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:09.360
 *He can speed up your time* 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:10.700
 *I really want to get one now* 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:11.520
 *laugh* 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.480
 Sorry, Chibi pants are plural nouns (English ==) 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:18.700
 Many people know that you are mentally retarded (`A ́) 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:20.240
 It has two pants. 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:25.220
 *喔 I hate that I have to wear my pants* 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.280
 *laugh* 

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:28.800
 *I mean...* 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:30.740
 (Interrupted) * Good rest in peace... Rest in peace Apple* 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:31.240
 *time to go* 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.000
 *I mean I can wear long pants forever* 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.100
 *Flower hair...* 

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.060
喔喔喔喔喔喔喔喔~~~~ 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:39.800
 ( ́∀`) 

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.200
 Chibi, let's leave soon. 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:45.500
 No one wants you, Chibi!! 

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.540
 *We have 20 pieces from Eoin...* 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:49.040
 He is so happy 

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.780
 Any form of attention... 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:52.780
 Focus on him 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.440
 Chibi is willing to bless you... 

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:59.320
 A... a lonely child knows that the only child in the family means Chibi. 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.320
 You know it is true you know 

00:06:01.320 --> 00:06:05.880
 *TomBee squirrel addict said that if he pronounced his name, he would give 5 more* 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.060
 * I hope I didn't miss it~~* 

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:12.920
 * Accept the challenge* (Chibi what are you doing...) 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:19.260
 I like him hesitating before playing the Internet stalk. 

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.860
 Look at him like "I should be so brazen?" 

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.000
 Should you have a cheeky Chibi? 

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.080
 *accept the challenge* 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:31.080
 *Street thinness and swelling* 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.780
 awesome 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.740
 Great~~ 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:36.420
 *He doesn't actually talk, so he won't say that under any circumstances* 

00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:38.080
 God == *哼哼哼* 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:39.440
 *You can imagine him going * 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.260
 Do this super painful ( ́A` ) 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:42.900
 * I have speeding pants *== 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.800
 *You wait for a turbo pants to wear* 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.820
 This is the time for you to be jealous. 

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.280
 ( ́∀`) 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.900
 They made a good conversation and talked back to each other. 

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.720
 Communicate with each other but he still has to continue 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.960
 *You are making me more excited now* 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:59.400
 *I don't think you are ready* 

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.500
 *me too* 

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.260
 Don’t talk about it again, just accept Chibi, don’t say it again. 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:08.000
 * I need a little time to get my body ready*(?) 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.760
 You really he X... damn damn 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.280
 * Do not doubt the power of weapons* 

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:16.540
 *Sure* 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.000
 "好喔" XD 

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.600
 *喔 Today is also someone’s birthday欸* 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.700
 *How likely is it?* 

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:23.700
 *噗...Yes* 

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:26.240
 Oh, it was Chibi’s birthday, I didn’t notice. 

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.760
 Maybe that's why Caveman isn't so bad for him. 

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.880
 It’s Chibi’s birthday...Oh my God...this makes the film even better. 

00:07:34.180 --> 00:07:34.680
 Hey 

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:37.820
 *I haven’t seen it since the Super Mario Bros. U.* (竿子) 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:40.100
 *Good jokes* 

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:41.680
 Swan ಠAಠ 

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.900
 You don’t laugh when you hear a good joke 

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:47.180
 Instead, it is said in a deadly tone... 

00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.020
 "Good joke" ಠ_ಠ 

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:53.120
 You only know that this joke has "more" humor. 

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.180
 In this case... 

00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.220
 How long have they been playing? 

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.220
 18 minutes have not been long 

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.120
 They said that they have to play for an hour and a half. 

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.000
 But Caveman can't stand it anymore. 

00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:06.580
 He...he ( ́∀`) 

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:08.460
 The atmosphere is too much 

00:08:08.540 --> 00:08:10.460
 He needs to stop, he has to do something 

00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:11.900
 *Good jokes* 

00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:14.860
 Chibi’s words and deeds are fine. 

00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:18.400
 So Caveman can't tell him to shut up. 

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:21.740
 *So this confirms that the old man's favorite hand is a squirrel* 

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:24.620
 *It would be great if you could be quiet* 

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.700
 *But you are right* 

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.760
喔喔喔喔~~~Chibi!!! 

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.880
 Chibi A~~~(・∀・) 

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.000
 *laughing out loud* 

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:45.660
 *Suck* 

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.660
 No...( ́∀`) (smile and optimism: swept away) 

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.800
 *pewds, are you okay* 

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.560
 Swan~~ 

00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:53.100
 Oh... 

00:08:53.400 --> 00:08:55.940
 God bless this is my favorite paragraph 

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:00.200
 Really bad but very reasonable 

00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:02.260
 I will first show that I am not biased towards one of them. 

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.580
 But I have a little bit on the side of Caveman. 

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:07.640
 Because if he doesn’t ask for it, it’s really annoying. 

00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.300
 I also have a little sympathy for Chibi. 

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.940
 I also think that both of them are... 

00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:16.080
 How many places have been wrong, some aspects 

00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:17.680
 So almost in... 

00:09:18.540 --> 00:09:21.260
 After 30 minutes, after 30 minutes, after a little less... 

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:23.040
 I think he is quiet for about 30 minutes. 

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:25.140
 I’ve been sitting there... sullen 

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:27.800
 That day is his birthday! He is not happy. 

00:09:28.020 --> 00:09:30.980
 Too bad, he sinks into the sofa. 

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.120
 *From TwoStrains...* 

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:37.200
 *Read the netizen's message* "I want to hear more from the green sweatshirt and let him speak." 

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.260
 (`∀ ́) 

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:41.760
 I like Caveman and let him talk directly. 

00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:44.160
 *Hi* 

00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.100
 Oh, my god, I can’t stand it. 

00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:50.080
 *Beard cool* 

00:09:50.080 --> 00:09:50.900
 *Thank you* 

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:55.060
 * You got all the pig bags. This means that you have to play all the devils now.* 

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:56.540
 *The mode of the demon king off* 

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:59.520
 Why is there a passerby girl holding a paper out? God. 

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:00.940
 * 5 bucks from DieSOayd* 

00:10:00.940 --> 00:10:06.040
 *Read the netizen message* "Enjoy the customs clearance. If the green jacket guy jumps 10 times, I will fight 10 more." 

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:07.240
 Green jacket guy A~~~ 

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:10.740
 Let's jump~~喔He is super happy 

00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:13.760
 I told you that he would be super happy when he got attention. 

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.180
 *You can't go back to this place. You will see it first...* 

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.340
 That is not the opening and closing jump * laugh * 

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.960
 ( ́∀`) 

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.520
 Oh, this makes me a little excited. 

00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.560
 Oh, God... 

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.940
 *Good dude...I don't know. *Oh God... 

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:31.120
 "Good dude... I don't know." 

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:36.860
 You have been together on the sofa for an hour. It really works very well. Very good. 

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:39.500
 *Thank you for the amount of exercise that I have consumed for a week* 

00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:44.760
 *Tomba!2's background music is just as good as the 尴尬 atmosphere* 

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:48.300
 Dudu~~ God, I want to change to Chibi. 

00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:51.700
 *Thank you for your video game evil pig list* 

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:52.800
 *What is it like?* 

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.060
 *Hmm... Big King Kong Racing* 

00:10:55.180 --> 00:10:56.060
 *The legend of Salda* 

00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:57.760
 * Earth Adventure* 

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.040
 *Thank you for your video game evil pig list* 

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:02.860
 *You are welcome* 

00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:04.920
 I mean, you asked him what he asked. 

00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:07.260
 He asked!!...well, I am just 

00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.980
 I tried to deal with this 

00:11:09.980 --> 00:11:13.540
 Who are you standing on the side of the Chibi team or the Caveman team? 

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.240
 This is already a few years ago, and no one is birding it. 

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.800
 This is a reply from Caveman. 

00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:20.340
 *Is I angry after playing Tomba!2?* 

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:24.820
 * The short answer is: No complete reply is: Mom's good insurance is not * 

00:11:24.820 --> 00:11:27.040
 *...I only know that he is called Chibi* 

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:28.080
 He is still playing Tomba喔

00:11:29.140 --> 00:11:30.800
 How did he continue to play Tomba?? 

00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.960
 *...I only know that he is called Chibi* 

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:36.460
 *It’s a good name for men* 

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.540
 ( ́∀`) 

00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:40.620
 It is a good name for men. 

00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:45.140
 *I told him to be quiet because he was too king and I didn't invite him to sit over* 

00:11:45.400 --> 00:11:47.160
 *He is so unsolicited* 

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:52.100
 *Take your shoulders to my side so that my elbows can't move and still don't...* 

00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:57.260
 It’s just because the prohibition of your elbow being touched by God will only make the scene more embarrassing. 

00:11:57.560 --> 00:12:00.320
 *... Shut up someone seeing the opening and closing jumps he made?* 

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:01.060
 There is Ah ( ́∀`) 

00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:05.580
 *Swan, at least do a few standard opening and closing jumps* 

00:12:05.580 --> 00:12:07.780
 That is the main mistake of Chibi. 

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.820
 He didn't do it... 

00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.940
 Standard opening and closing 

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.880
 This makes me angry every time... 

00:12:13.260 --> 00:12:17.060
 Have been shaking all the time... no one jumps the standard opening and closing fleas every time! 

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.540
 If you don't have any sympathy for Chibi, here are... 

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:26.440
 A 10-minute film his mother interrupted his paper Mario's quick clearance 

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.020
 *Go to a step!* 

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:32.180
 *I don't care anymore?* 

00:12:32.180 --> 00:12:35.060
 *We talked about not being able to use these things all night* 

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.020
 *But I didn't use it all night...* 

00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:40.460
 *I don’t care whether it’s a weekend or not. The world is not around you. 

00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.360
 *No it is not* 

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:44.420
 What he should say to his mother is... 

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:49.960
 "Sorry, I am playing a little faster than the ordinary people of you." 

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.460
 "Mom, you need to leave and go away." 

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.760
 "I am living my own life" 

00:12:55.180 --> 00:12:59.180
 We will not end up thinking that I am sour people. 

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:01.000
 Although I am all in acid 

00:13:01.020 --> 00:13:03.120
 This clip is my favorite fast clearance 

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:05.160
 This is for me 

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.940
 Very interesting because it will be super excited 

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:10.000
 Anyway, it is right ( ́・ω・`) 

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.540
 *One MR-RL moment* 

00:13:11.540 --> 00:13:13.320
 *I and Marc Rutzou (the first person to break the fastest record)* 

00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:15.060
 *I and his X's Marc Rutzou* 

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:16.080
 *Yes* 

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.400
 * I skip directly 1:13* 

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:18.700
 *I am his legendary X* 

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:21.100
 * I never broke 1:13* 

00:13:21.100 --> 00:13:22.520
 *In the future, he has no chance for X* 

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.040
 * directly broke to 1:12 baby* 

00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:25.500
 *To the day I entered the coffin* 

00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:26.240
 Obviously he broke 1:12 

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:26.740
 *Like it! It’s obvious that he broke 1:12. 

00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:27.240
 Obviously he broke 1:12 

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.340
 * I ended this at a super lucky time* 

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.080
 In this map* I ended this at a super lucky time* 

00:13:29.080 --> 00:13:29.580
 * I ended this at a super lucky time* 

00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:30.240
 *Bastards!!!* 

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:32.440
 *I also unplugged the grenades* 

00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:33.540
 *This is the right thing!!* This explanation is also amazing. 

00:13:33.540 --> 00:13:34.740
 This explanation is also amazing. 

00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:38.000
 *This is it* 

00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:38.940
 Because that is obviously the lowest number of seconds the map can break. 

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:40.000
 *Yes is this game* because that is obviously the lowest number of seconds the map can break. 

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:40.500
 Because that is obviously the lowest number of seconds the map can break. 

00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.560
 *I am super fast* because that is obviously the lowest number of seconds the map can break. 

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.140
 *This game will definitely break 1:12* 

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.520
 *Here... right!!!!* 

00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:45.820
 *It’s just this game!!!* This seems like no one has broken (he is the second one) 

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:47.200
 It seems like no one has broken (he is the second one) 

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:50.500
 *I must find this full movie and get it* 

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.960
 *Brother is so fast!* 

00:13:58.100 --> 00:13:59.540
 *Fuck him X fast* 

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:05.300
 *Be optimistic when I get the grenade 

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:06.220
 (Sorry) 

00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:07.020
 ( ́∀`) 

00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:12.280
 Ok, that... 

00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.700
 *Let’s see how fast I am going* 

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:15.340
 I am going to say 呐

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.500
 * Directly give him a headshot!!! Cool!!!* 

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.060
 * Broken 1:12 baby* 

00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:22.000
 *Yes!!!! Did you see that one?* 

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.800
 I have seen 喔* I really blasted him* 

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.400
 *Look at me this trick to avoid* 

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:26.620
 *I am like "Yeah baby!"* 

00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.660
 * Let's come * 

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:29.420
 *I wait... 

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.940
 * At the same time as he sneaked while shooting 

00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:33.760
 *Double~* 

00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:35.040
 * Body armor * (?) 

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.840
 *Two fast, I know that I am going the right way* 

00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:39.660
 *Look at my pace* 

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:40.560
 *50~~* 

00:14:40.840 --> 00:14:41.600
 *49~~* 

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:44.260
 *47啦宝贝!!!* 

00:14:44.260 --> 00:14:44.800
 Yeah~~~~~~ 

00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:45.660
 *No 绰啦~~~* 耶~~~~~~ 

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:47.280
 *That's it!* 

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:49.700
 *Please look again to support* 

00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:52.440
 *I am waiting because I said "God may be 1:12"* 

00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:54.040
 *It is !!!!!! 

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:55.540
 *No baby!* 

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:56.400
 *Yay!!!* 

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:58.040
喔~~~ 

00:15:00.060 --> 00:15:00.860
 awesome 

00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.480
 Let me see every time I am excited 

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:10.100
 That’s right, some of them are awesome and awesome. 

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:15.120
 Leave a message below to let me know if you are a Chibi team or a Caveman team. 

00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:17.360
 I think my position is more biased towards Caveman. 

00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:19.340
 But I think they are all autistic 

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:23.920
 Also look at Crowbcat's channel, he found the film and compiled it. 

00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:25.480
 The above is what I want to say. 

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.140
 Thank you very much for watching. 

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.960
 As usual, sister punches ( ́∀`)
