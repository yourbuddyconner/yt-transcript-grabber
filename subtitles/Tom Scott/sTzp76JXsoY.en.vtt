00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380
 Let's say your team just won a World Cup match. 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.200
 Unlikely if you are English, I understand, but let's say you are French 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.600
 and just beat the Swiss and you feel patriotic. 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.040
 You open your phone, you go to your Twitter app, which gives you 140 characters 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:15.980
 and the first thing you do is swipe through the keyboard, 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.960
 you swipe through the emojis on your phone until you find the French flag. 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.920
 And then you press the button and he probably gives you a nice, wavy flag here 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.160
 and of course it helps a bit that the French flag is fairly easy to draw 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.420
 compared to the British flag. That's it. 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:38.000
 But once you've done that, one flag is entered, your number of characters will change directly to 138. 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.940
 Why does that happen? You only entered one flag there 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.100
 and you can enter even more complex characters. Emojis, generally 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.020
 are very very long when it comes to binary representation, 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.280
 but they count as one character. 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:58.300
 Type an A, one character. A very complex emoji smiley, one character. 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.000
 Why does the flag cost two characters? 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.300
 The reason has to do with the Unicode Consortium. 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.960
 They are the people who decide what goes in Unicode and they are the reason that you have 250 new emojis. 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.020
 But they do not want to put flags in Unicode because flags change very often. 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.820
 In the last decade more countries have been added, countries have been changed by military coups 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.280
 or because the citizens revolted and so they have changed their flags. 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.260
 And Unicode does not want to deal with that, so instead they have made something 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.100
 called 'Regional Indicator symbols' 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.180
 Yes, I can write fine on a whiteboard. That's it. 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.600
 Regional indicator symbols. 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.980
 And what they are are characters that are simply A to Z. 

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.340
 with dots around it. That is the official representation. 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.540
 And what that button does, what that French flag does, 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.260
 is that he does not type in a French flag. 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.460
 In reality, he types in, behind the scenes, 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.660
 what anyone who does not have the French flag as a picture will see, 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.420
 an F and an R. 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.040
 Fr. 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.280
 That is the code for France, French sites also end on .fr. 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.560
 That code is what all programs that do not support the French flag see. 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.920
 The iPhone supports him. Android supports him in most cases. 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.980
 I think modern versions of Windows still support him. 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:21.760
 He takes those two characters and says 'oh, you mean the French flag!' 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.940
 He puts them together, 'lies' to you and shows you only one character. 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.300
 But the number of characters you have left is not, because Twitter sees them as two characters 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:34.820
 because they actually are, they count as two 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.040
 and your number goes down. 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.540
 So that's it. Two characters, joined together as one, form the French flag. 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:48.060
 It's that simple: that's why it takes two characters to make an emoji flag and not one. 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.560
 And if that was pretty interesting, then I have a much longer video about what counts as a character 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.780
 in my own language series and soon there will be an upload about emojis and their history here. 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.140
 In the meantime, this is why two characters for a flag are needed 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.740
 and that is something you may not have known. 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.400
 This really does not happen. 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.220
 Is this not a whiteboard paint? 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:15.660
 This is just a wall, I have drawn on the wall 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.340
