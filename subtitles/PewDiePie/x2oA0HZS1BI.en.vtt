00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.200
 Have you been tired of hearing the news (Lokn Paul) this wonderful I am also (Khlani hate my life not much) 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.780
 But before we move on to the drama that will inevitably occur and overlook anything that has happened 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.200
 There are a few things to consider 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.280
 But you said bad words and therefore you are not allowed to criticize him 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:29.620
 Damn .. I forgot .. Fuck .. Damn .. God damn I kept forgetting I said bad words 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.100
 Oh well .. Haha 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.780
 You have to give the paul some support you know .. they have a good game ball play .. you know someone doing something .. 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.760
 You are not expected to completely overlook the .. how bad the other person was and then only back and forth 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:54.140
 You can also say that (John Paul) in deep pain after this incident is suffering in a huge and clearly follow him stood in front of him and said, "No, 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.300
 I have exceeded the line 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:05.060
 And many people have noticed that the video "Forest of Suicide" is a mistake and everyone makes mistakes you make mistakes O (Felix) 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:06.320
 This is a fact 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:15.700
 I'm doing it, I'm guilty. Oh, but people were also watching clips (old) and they noticed a repetitive pattern 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.940
 If you know, you guys, I'm a little patient and somewhat vocal .. Oh, O Lord, see these tomatoes 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.040
 Have you just thrown tomatoes? on the wall ? This is fun! 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.120
 I offer you guys more exciting fun, incredible content 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:33.720
 Please throw other tomatoes on the wall because it was fun 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.480
 * Loren and his friend Yasslan * 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:45.560
 We are beginning to fall ill .. and now we will sell masking masks. * Link to the store * Get your mask now and stop the "bubonic plague" from spreading in your city 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.820
 Waiter: These are just here for the show's sake: Oh well okay this is my fault 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:02.980
 Biodes: Hey, how old are you? So when he was in Japan (for John Paul) he clearly knew about the Japanese culture and was truly respected above all else 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.520
 I should be careful not to respect their culture here in Japan. Everything depends on "respect" 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.400
 Photographer: It's actually the truth for Jen: I know it's the truth so I have to lower my talking levels down 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.640
 * Laughing * 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:27.920
 I did not adjust that to make it look bad .. He who did this hehehe does not have to do anything Oh man 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:38.200
 Here is where the coins are in the well and wish the security becomes a reality Photographer: What do you wish? I wish health and happiness and prostitutes from hell .. Come on 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:50.880
 I know when you are in a church, a mosque or a Buddhist temple, there is a sincerity you should always keep under the first degree. 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:03:05.580
 I'm not a clergyman or anything like that until then you're learning .. You should show some respect and you're at a Buddhist temple just throwing money like "does not matter" that's too stupid 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.200
 Luo: What does he do? Policeman: No .. 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:18.240
 Some authorities were not happy with them and they represented this way and their mentor was the only one who apologized for being the person who should come forward like "I'm sorry for that person" 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:20.140
 * Japanese words * 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.620
 - What did you do? I was fantastic for four seconds .. = I was just cleaning myself with water and it was like "oh oh" 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.040
 Policeman: I am sorry photography .. Photography .. I said: Ooh oh film .. The star .. I will see you soon, you guys .. 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:42.540
 Because you are in a Buddhist temple .. He may be a tourist attraction and there are many people and as a person very loving to Japan and love to visit there I always be warned when I was there 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:50.520
 I do not want to be that person (like Paul) and his friend .. I do not want to be .. he is not attractive 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.560
 He is not the person you want to be 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:58.760
 You know how things are going on in Japan. Everything about respect. We will respect some. I know it 's new. We have to do something. 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:01.340
 Literally following the next shot. 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:03.560
 * For coughing cough * 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.600
 He is not sick 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.260
 - He is not sick = I am not sick 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:18.680
 I understand that he is sick and this is a problem but that they are in damned Japan, he shouted. In Japan, it is dangerous for germs to spread that they are wearing sick masks not to protect themselves from infected people.
