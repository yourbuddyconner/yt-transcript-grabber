00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:02.169
 This is Poldhu in Cornwall. 

00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:05.540
 It is the easternmost and westernmost place on the main British island. 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.730
 From here, you can head west to Newfoundland, Canada, on a straight line without interruption. 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.719
 And here, too, Guglielmo Marconi and his team demonstrated, 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.030
 that you can transmit radio signals even over the horizon. 

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.880
 In 1903, however, his attention turned in the opposite direction. 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.820
 Literally. It's about 400 km east of here. 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.430
 He wanted to show the first public show 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.820
 wireless long-range transmission. 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:28.410
 Signals from here, 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.730
 from this now destroyed building in Cornwall, 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.160
 would be transferred to Chelmsford. Then resubmitted 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.359
 and detected in London with the participation of many viewers. 

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:40.079
 And so in the prestigious auditorium of the Royal Institute of Great Britain, 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.609
 where Faraday and many, many others have lectured and still lecture on science, 

00:00:44.609 --> 00:00:47.059
 a highly respected physicist John Ambrose Fleming 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.760
 he was preparing for Marconi's morse signals. 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.499
 For this reason, a sixty-foot-high special antenna was added to the roof. 

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:55.390
 And remember: It happened more than a century ago. 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.979
 Marconi sent a signal strong enough to be able to take him three hundred miles away. 

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:03.449
 Plus: He claimed to have solved the problem of listeners. 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.390
 In a letter to St. James Gazette Marconi said: 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.090
 "I can set my devices so that no other device is set up 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.700
 he could not accept. "Which is theoretically true, 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.240
 but it actually describes the tuning of the radio station. 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.610
 The whole world can listen to you when it knows the right frequency. 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.870
 This is not encryption, but broadcasting. 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.090
 So let's introduce Nevila Maskelyna. 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.640
 He was a variety magician like his father. 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.060
 He was interested in wireless technology. He even used it in his illusions. 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.990
 He himself was able to transmit wirelessly. 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.410
 But the problem was that Marconi had a patent. 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:36.750
 I know this will sound crazy today, 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.320
 but the very idea of ​​wireless transmission was entirely new 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.900
 and Marconi had a patent. 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.280
 If you wanted to carry something in Morse's alphabet, you had to be licensed. 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.980
 Maskelyne was not very excited about it. 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.580
 He already had a mast built fifty feet short of one of Marconi's stations in Cornwall 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.860
 and managed to disrupt broadcasting. 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:57.520
 And in his diary, along with a beautiful scientific insult, he wrote: 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:02.930
 "The problem was not disturbance, but how to deal with a huge surplus of energy." 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.880
 Marconi and Fleming knew who was Maskelyne. 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.230
 And they feared him. 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.179
 And by the way: From my mouth it sounds like a story of two rivals, 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.829
 because I simplify it a lot. 

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.400
 At that time, many scientists were engaged in similar projects 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.390
 and they all had to deal with Marconi's patents. 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.280
 The competition was cruel. But only one of them decided to direct the attack. 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.239
 So in the Royal Institute, 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.040
 just a few minutes before the expected arrival of Marconi's signal, 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.379
 when the audience was preparing and listening to Fleming 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:32.469
 the assertion of the system, which today seems to be slightly dubious, 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.290
 there was a silent tap on the receiver. 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.139
 Fleming was somewhat lying. He did not notice it. 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.319
 But his assistant noticed. And he knew Morse's alphabet. 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.769
 And the word "rats" sounded from the receiver. Several times in a row: "Rats, rats, rats ..." 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.129
 And then the receiver tapped the insulting rhyming twin about Marconi 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:50.730
 and several tremendous sarcastic quotes from Shakespeare's works. 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.099
 And then he stopped. Only a few moments before the start of Marconi's own broadcast. 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:58.049
 Marconi and Fleming were angry. 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:00.469
 They thought it was sabotage using some refined method. 

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:02.879
 Maybe sending signals slightly out of phase 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:05.129
 or grounding somewhere around, but it was not. 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.310
 Maskelyne just installed a simple but powerful transmitter 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.249
 in its nearby varieties. 

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:11.920
 He did not worry about frequencies at all. 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.130
 It simply sent a broadband signal, 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:15.439
 -if it was sent today- 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.689
 heard from any analogue radio within a few miles. 

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:20.980
 No matter what station was tuned. 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.379
 I guess I would have destroyed any sensitive devices around. 

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:26.459
 Their quarrels continued in the papers. 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:28.299
 In the angry letters in Times 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.950
 Fleming called it "scientific hooliganism." 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.169
 And Maskelyne confessed and defended his hacking- 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.999
 -that was hacking-as a necessary demonstration. 

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:40.680
 But the most important thing was the opinion of the people. And she got them 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.829
 Marconi's credibility with a big bang. 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.189
 Even Punch, a well-known satirical magazine, 

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:46.730
 he also suffered a blow, 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.209
 that he deliberately dispatched the fake "Marconigrams". 

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.629
 In the modern times of security, we speak of responsible discovery. 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:56.059
 When you find anywhere in the system a security vulnerability, 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:59.680
 you should inform it quietly about the company that is involved, 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.239
 and leave them time to repair. 

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:03.519
 If, however, for a reasonably long time, 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.150
 still the error occurs, they are not going to fix it 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.409
 and if you can reveal it so you do not break the law and cause damage ... 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:14.499
 Well, sometimes it is right to cause such a smaller drama. 

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:18.709
 After all, you have over a century of history of such dramas behind you. 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.220
 The YouTube Channel of the Royal Institute contains lots of cool videos, 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.860
 including Tales From The Prep Room, 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.539
 which is a series I'd like to recommend. 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:27.750
 Check out their channel and sign up for a subscription. 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.330
 And they have a great thank you for letting me film at this historic auditorium.
