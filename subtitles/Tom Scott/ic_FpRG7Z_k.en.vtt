00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.970
 Behind me is the Royal Homeopathic Hospital London. 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.750
 And I'm here because this week was interesting for alternative medicine in Britain. 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.290
 This week, Noel Edmonds, a television star and propagator of the crazy series of Nineties, Mr. Blobby, 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.719
 recommended something called EMP Pad. It's a yoga mat, 

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:18.560
 and its inventors claim that its electromagnetic fields with very low intensity 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.069
 help to work cells in the body. 

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:24.509
 I will not deal with the evidence details for Pad. 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:27.319
 I am very skeptical, but there are early studies that say, 

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:31.249
 that cautiously used specific elmg. Fields can really be beneficial. 

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:32.920
 I know, too, I was surprised. 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.539
 Well, the yoga mat will not work like this, 

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:38.989
 but there are devices using elmg. Fields that work well enough to do so, 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.179
 that insurance companies have begun to reimburse them. 

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:45.160
 I skip off the insulting reactions that Noel Edmonds got from people on Twitter, 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.129
 especially after telling someone suffering from cancer, 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.589
 that it could be because of their "negative attitude". 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:54.829
 Instead, let's look at the reaction of people who make EMP Pad. 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.940
 Because clearly, skeptics will not like anything they do, 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.940
 but there are many supporters of alternative medicine. 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.589
 Surely, would the company welcome the celebrities ?! 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:10.090
 No. At the top of their webpages, in capital letters, they completely distanced themselves from Noel Edmonds. 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.939
 It has nothing to do with us, they wrote. 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.079
 And the reason: Edmonds claimed they could help treat cancer. 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:20.659
 All over Europe, it is forbidden to promote prescription drugs and treatment methods in public. 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.270
 They can advertise to doctors, of course, but we just do not have it 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.710
 those US classifieds of drugs with a long list of side effects. 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.369
 "There have been serious, sometimes fatal consequences such as infections, lymphoma, 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:33.000
 "or other types of cancer. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.850
 "There have been circulatory, excretory and digestive problems, severe allergic reactions, 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.850
 "and new or worsened heart failure." 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.689
 But in Britain there are even stricter laws on cancer treatment. 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:46.869
 It is not enough to say, "Oh, in fact, it is not a medical device" 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.009
 or "Oh, these are just some herbs". 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.180
 If you sell something in public and if you say it can help or cure cancer, 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.509
 you can be prosecuted. 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.219
 Even if it treated cancer. 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.299
 The idea of ​​1939, when that law was passed, still holds true today. 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.820
 Sell ​​medicines to doctors. If you give them an alternative medicine that works, 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.830
 with evidence that persuades them enough to start prescribing it, 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.970
 and the one who discovered it is probably waiting for the Nobel Prize. 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.580
 And if they do not start prescribing: Well, I'm not going to cure cancer, huh? 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.360
 If you sell your medicine directly to the public, 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.000
 it almost certainly does not cure it. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.800
 And it probably hurts people who would otherwise go to the doctor. 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.470
 With this law, nobody needs to show that your medicine is not working: 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.230
 just prove that you are not selling it through someone qualified. 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.600
 Noel Edmonds was in his tongue when he said, "This is curing cancer." 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.830
 I think he's irresponsible, but he can believe it, 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.040
 and he himself does not sell any yoga mats. 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.250
 "Then my tumor was destroyed by the sound waves, 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.620
 "which again proves that energy is at the heart of this problem." 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.340
 But those who sell them, 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.750
 they had to reject this claim immediately, 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.710
 or risking an investigation that they would really like to avoid. 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:00.900
