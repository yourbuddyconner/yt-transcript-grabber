00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.460
 Sometimes I go to a place and tell stories 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.070
 But occasionally I go somewhere and do not just find stories 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.050
 but also a very good storyteller 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:10.790
 On the grounds of the Alnwick castle, in the north of England, 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.840
 is the Alnwick castle garden. 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.660
 It is not as old as the castle, 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:15.889
 that here is about 900 years, 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.760
 but just as impressive. 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.590
 Inside is one of the largest tree houses in the world, 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.300
 beautiful water features and also ... this. 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.650
 The less common Alnwick Gif Garden. 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.940
 Welcome to the Poison garden. 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.099
 All the plants here can kill you, 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:35.160
 so it is not allowed to touch, smell or be close to them. 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.760
 This is Ricinus communis (wonder tree) 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.829
 and you can see that it has entire architectural leaves, 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:43.890
 but the problem with it is 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.390
 that, under laboratory conditions, you can remove ricin. 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.260
 Ricine is the deadliest poison known to man 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.410
 Here we have Atropa belladonna, a deadly nightshade, 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.790
 a native plant in the UK. 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:56.510
 These flowers that you see here 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.920
 can make a black grape-like berry. 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.420
 Four of those berries are enough to kill a child. 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.579
 Really very toxic. 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.290
 In Italy, especially around Venice, 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.910
 the women squeeze out the berries to obtain the juice 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.460
 and then they put the juice in their eyes 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.810
 to widen their pupils so that they looked more attractive to men. 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.680
 Because it is toxic, you slowly begin to lose your sight. 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.870
 What you do not do for vanity. 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:22.670
 Ruta graveolens (Wijnruit), again, a common plant 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.920
 that you can actually buy in garden centers, yet it is phototoxic 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.450
 which means that if you get the juice on your hands, 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.360
 and your skin will start to blister in bright sunlight. 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.450
 The moment that substance is in your system, 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.810
 it stays there for up to 7 years. 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.290
 We had an older gardener who came here in the Gif garden 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.440
 and saw weeds grow from this plant, 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.600
 and pulling the weeds out without putting on her gloves 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.399
 Within an hour, she got blisters on her hand 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.540
 and she ended up with third-degree burns. 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.060
 This plant has Aconitum napellus. 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.409
 He is very common. 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:01:57.710
 He is often also called monkshood. 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.869
 The complete plant is very poisonous. 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.740
 Two years ago, there was a head gardener in Surrey 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.689
 who unfortunately was working with this plant 

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.690
 and he died a few days later 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.340
 and they blamed the plant's poisons. 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.030
 Here we also have a common plant, 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.050
 This is bay leaf, which is often used as a hedge. 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.450
 The problem with laurel is that it produces cyanide 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.070
 and in fact, Victoriaans used the leaves of these plants. 

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.480
 Split in two, done in a jam jar with the butterflies they had caught, 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.790
 lid on it and the butterfly died naturally 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.320
 by the cyanide poisoning. 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.940
 Then, you can buy this plant in garden centers, 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.240
 a common pot plant, he is called Brugmansia 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.170
 and the whole plant is poisonous. 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.950
 He is often called the Angel Trumpet. 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.370
 It is a hallucinogenic plant so you can use it in many different ways. 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:50.590
 In fact, Victorian women grew the Brugmansia on their tea tables 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.510
 and then she invited other women for afternoon tea. 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.100
 What they did then, they shook 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.170
 a little bit of pollen in the teapot that would go into the tea 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.530
 what loosened their tongue 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.950
 and would have them talk about all kinds of nonsense. 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.600
 We have a license from the Ministry of the Interior for growing Cannabis. 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.880
 We're in a cage here. 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.040
 Of course, it is a C class drug. 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.180
 We use this plant to introduce children 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.270
 to the harmful effects of drugs 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:16.500
 This is Henbane. 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.990
 It produces very peculiar flowers 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.560
 that give off a sharp smell. 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.360
 The smell is so strong that we often have people collapsing here, 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.720
 that's why we have a couch at the wall. 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.440
 Alruin, or the better-known name Mandragora, 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.640
 is a very popular plant because of Harry Potter. 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.250
 The complete plant is poisonous, 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.310
 In the past, people thought that there was a small man 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.940
 under the plant, because if you douse the plant, 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:46.750
 the main root often had two small legs and a small arm 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:49.430
 and so people invented that it was the devil. 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.540
 People often said that they could hear the plant screaming when it was excavated, 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.150
 and so there were many myths and legends around the Mandragora 

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.690
 The Duchess of Northumerland was the inspiration for the entire garden. 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.780
 When she became a duchess, she had a vision 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.390
 to create a modern, contemporary garden that would teach visitors something. 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.910
 Then the Duchess realized: especially children do not want to listen 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.260
 to lectures about herb gardens because then they switch off. 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.180
 If you can tell them that the plants are really poisonous 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.080
 and you can kill, 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.650
 then you have to catch the imagination of that child. 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.190
 Many thanks to the whole team at the Alnwick garden, and especially Trevor! 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.840
 If you want to know more about the gardens or the castle, 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.120
 look at the description.
