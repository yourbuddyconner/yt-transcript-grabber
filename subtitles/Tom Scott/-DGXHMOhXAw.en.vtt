00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:02.789
 In 1881 architect William Brown 

00:00:02.789 --> 00:00:05.219
 and Benjamin Haugh, an iron smelter owner 

00:00:05.219 --> 00:00:07.576
 an idea patented for a new type of prison. 

00:00:07.576 --> 00:00:09.360
 The Spinning Prison. 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.491
 In retrospect, it was not such a good idea 

00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:14.029
 Impractical, unsafe and extremely complex. 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:15.849
 But that did not stop them from selling this idea 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.699
 to a number of cities in the US. 

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:21.969
 The first one was built here, in Crawfordsville, Indiana. 

00:00:21.969 --> 00:00:23.840
 Although there have been no prisoners for decades, 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.171
 is this the only thing the mechanism still works. 

00:00:27.171 --> 00:00:29.019
 The rotating prison has two floors, 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:31.499
 and there are eight cells on each floor. 

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:34.379
 The steel monster weighs about thirty tons. 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.190
 The whole is operated by a hand crank which 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.137
 move both floors simultaneously. 

00:00:39.137 --> 00:00:42.486
 It does not touch the walls or the bars anywhere 

00:00:42.486 --> 00:00:46.116
 the whole machine moves around a central cylinder 

00:00:46.116 --> 00:00:49.206
 that runs from the roof to the sewerage. 

00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:52.476
 It works like a pivot where all the weight rests 

00:00:52.476 --> 00:00:54.857
 on the top of the fulcrum. 

00:00:54.857 --> 00:00:57.926
 At that time it was a marvel of technology. 

00:00:57.926 --> 00:01:01.206
 The advantage of the rotating prison 

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:03.348
 was that there was only one doorway, 

00:01:03.348 --> 00:01:05.546
 the prisoners were able to get in and out of their cell 

00:01:05.546 --> 00:01:08.546
 from a pie-shaped cell block. 

00:01:09.467 --> 00:01:12.337
 With only one door, fewer guards were needed 

00:01:12.337 --> 00:01:16.126
 to guard the prisoners. 

00:01:16.126 --> 00:01:17.580
 There is only one exit. 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.980
 The crescent shape is the toilet that is welded shut. 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.380
 After the construction in 1880, the prisoners had 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.700
 a toilet and running water in the cell 

00:01:29.708 --> 00:01:32.186
 while most houses did not even have that. 

00:01:32.186 --> 00:01:36.106
 From 1882 there were some problems 

00:01:36.106 --> 00:01:40.340
 until 1838 that there was only one opening on each floor. 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.920
 And there was only one moving door 

00:01:42.926 --> 00:01:45.436
 that prevented prisoners on the floors 

00:01:45.436 --> 00:01:47.076
 jumped out of the opening when they wanted to. 

00:01:47.076 --> 00:01:50.474
 In case of fire there was a risk that a guard 

00:01:50.474 --> 00:01:53.097
 there had to be all prisoners one by one 

00:01:53.097 --> 00:01:54.777
 to leave them in safety. 

00:01:54.777 --> 00:01:58.156
 Another problem was that 50% of the prisoners 

00:01:58.156 --> 00:02:00.897
 was arrested for drunkenness and in a cell 

00:02:00.897 --> 00:02:03.546
 were made to make room for others later 

00:02:03.546 --> 00:02:06.266
 prisoners who were brought in. 

00:02:06.266 --> 00:02:08.874
 Only they fell asleep on the floor with their arms or 

00:02:08.874 --> 00:02:10.787
 legs through the bars, while the machine started to turn 

00:02:10.787 --> 00:02:13.446
 with their arms and legs they got stuck between the 

00:02:13.446 --> 00:02:16.206
 wall and cell, limbs broke or amputated. 

00:02:16.206 --> 00:02:20.300
 In 1938 they stopped running the prison, 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.900
 They made a door in every cell 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.900
 and installed a tour. 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.276
 So they stopped running for the problems that 

00:02:27.276 --> 00:02:29.584
 there were fire and because of prisoners 

00:02:29.584 --> 00:02:31.513
 limbs were amputated. 

00:02:31.513 --> 00:02:34.676
 What we are told, as long as we maintain it 

00:02:34.676 --> 00:02:36.507
 continue to execute this machine and keep it that way 

00:02:36.507 --> 00:02:38.907
 treat it, it will continue to exist. 

00:02:38.907 --> 00:02:40.800
 We can then continue to run forever. 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.446
 There are a number of options for improvement 

00:02:42.446 --> 00:02:45.020
 The bars could have turned, not the cells. 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.580
 or the complex turning mechanism had been omitted 

00:02:47.586 --> 00:02:50.627
 can stay to open one cell at a time. 

00:02:50.627 --> 00:02:52.876
 Which actually amounts to an ordinary prison. 

00:02:52.876 --> 00:02:54.515
 The moral of the story? 

00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:56.606
 Because an idea has a patent 

00:02:56.606 --> 00:02:59.346
 Does not mean that is a good idea. 

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.953
 It only means that no one thought about it before 

00:03:00.953 --> 00:03:04.286
 and sometimes there is a reason for that.
