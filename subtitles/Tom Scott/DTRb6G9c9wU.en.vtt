00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.360
 It is -38 ° C inside. 

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.120
 I have never been anywhere so cold. 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.189
 I had to isolate my camera so that the batteries continue to work, 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.440
 and keep my microphone close to my body so that the wiring does not freeze and fall apart. 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:14.959
 This is in the United States National Ice Core Laboratory (United States National Ice Cream Laboratory), 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:17.100
 in Denver, Colorado, 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.200
 and I thought it would be best to interview the scientists who work here 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.470
 outside of this gigantic freezer. 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.430
 We have represented about 20,000 meters of ice here 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.980
 and that is probably from one of the 60 to 80 different boreholes from around the world. 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.530
 The deepest we have is about 30,600 meters through the ice cap of Antarctica. 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.500
 In our lab, the oldest ice cream we have is about 420,000 years old 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.630
 and that is from the Vostok Ice Core, drilled in the east of Antarctica in the mid-1990s. 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.230
 When a new core comes in, 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.070
 we distribute it and send it to the main researchers. 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.710
 This is all meteoric ice, 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.950
 This means ice that has fallen from the sky. 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.989
 They do not want tundra or sea ice, 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.050
 because it would contaminate the meteoric ice we have. 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.700
 One of the most important researchers who was carrying out an analysis 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.920
 can check his system from home, 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.549
 and he asked if someone was eating chips in the cafeteria 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.960
 for he began to see a larger amount of sodium in his samples. 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.740
 And they said, well ... indeed (!) 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.119
 That is how sensitive this is. 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.320
 If the main network fails, we have a natural gas-powered generator in the back, 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.469
 it automatically sends electricity to the freezer building. 

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:30.709
 We are 100% backed up. On everything. 

00:01:30.709 --> 00:01:35.240
 Each of these tubes contains a sample of ice from the North Pole or South Pole. 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.499
 And from the deeper under the ground the core was taken, the older he is: 

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:43.749
 all those fallen snow compressed for maybe hundreds of thousands of years, 

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:46.999
 along with all the other things that have been carried away from the atmosphere. 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:48.279
 Just about everything that is in the atmosphere 

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:51.889
 whether atmospheric gases or dust, or something similar, 

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:54.310
 eventually lands on the ice caps of Antarctica and Greenland 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.880
 and will be buried and caught in the snow. 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.460
 And when it is squeezed into ice, it stores that information 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.770
 so that we can actually use these ice cores 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.310
 to recreate how our atmospheric chemistry looked like 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.840
 until about 850,000 years ago. 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.130
 We can also determine the temperature on earth and how it changed with time 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.520
 by studying the stable isotopes of oxygen in the water molecules. 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.170
 In essence, they are looking for the ratio between ¹⁶O and ¹⁸O. 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.000
 And through the use of many contemporary studies, 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.560
 they can find out what the temperature was 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.450
 in the area where the snow fell. 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.110
 There is a wide variety of ways in which we can date these ice cores 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.740
 with cores from Greenland, we can often see actual visible layers 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:32.010
 these change from summer to winter, based on the dust concentration 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.920
 yes, a bit like tree rings, we can count those seasons back 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.460
 and thus get a date. 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.110
 And every now and then we will encounter things like volcanic ash layers 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.070
 and if sufficient material is present within an ash layer 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:44.750
 we can use radiometric dating to stick a very specific age on that volcanic layer. 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.990
 The margin of error with regard to our ages 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:49.720
 are usually inside, you know, ± 10 years or so. 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.660
 So it's pretty accurate, especially when we look at ice 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.670
 that is a few hundred thousand years old. 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.590
 By understanding the natural variations of climate change 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.820
 we can better predict what will happen in the future 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.690
 now that humanity has had a fairly significant impact 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:03.130
 about what's going on with our planet 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.050
 regarding the amount of greenhouse gases that we have discharged into the atmosphere 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.050
 in the past century. 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.390
 We can better understand the past 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.740
 and through the use of that knowledge of the past 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.600
 we can better model what will happen in the future. 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.790
 Thank you to the whole team here 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.020
 in the US National Ice Core Laboratory. 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.570
 Look in the description for more information about them and about their work 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.550
 and I think my eyelids stick together? 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.510
 (You can not see it, but you have frost everywhere on your eyelashes.) 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.460
 Really? (Yes!)
