00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
 Yes, there are a lot of memes on this channel. 

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:03.638
 You laugh you lose, 

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:04.920
 It's about memes. 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.760
 BioNews, 

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.880
 It's about reporting the memes. 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.420
 Review of Mimiz 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.230
 To review memes. 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.880
 But the finest 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.080
 Of them all, 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.120
 Greatest, most luxurious 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.049
 Of them all 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.480
 He is a "biodepay" momat 

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:20.580
 Right. 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:21.720
 I'm talking about course 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.620
 YouTube's favorite show 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.840
 Loawahay 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:35.800

 The flexible tape can not repair his heart 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.580
 When the real damage is inside 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.940
 Obviously, it takes a lot of effort to get the chance to bid at Spedit Biodepay who read it honestly and do not even try 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:55.020
 It's impossible, I love how this Mim fits on the floppy disk that he's wild 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.060
 Everyone was like: uh you're stealing a video that is as common as a jet plane 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.058
 Why ? Why does it bother me a bit if I just steal it? Right 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.510
 You can not steal what others steal from yo ... 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.100
 You can not. 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.960
 He stole it. Mona. Then she says. It's me. theft 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.720
 Disgusting. I'll tell her the Mim police 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:23.380
 If you do not care, Biodepi gives the last propist logo last before ending the channel 20. How can I even say that? 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.280
 Colored 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:33.080
 Like 2019 colors do not worry about it. And yes, I know that I look good as an anime character, 

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:34.360
 Mahahahaaha 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.879
 Look, this is what I tell you guys. I've been trying to tell you guys for a long time 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:45.179
 Yes, my love is my fiancÃ©e? Do you say my fiancee? My future wife is in fact 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.540
 Italiano, that's how she talks to me every time 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.260
 Felix: This is not very good. You need to have more relaxation on this video 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.450
 Ask them to put Lake now and press the bell button 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.959
 You will eventually reach this point in a relationship where all you do is this and I will know exactly what you are talking about 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.980
 Oh, he's one of those. Why do I wear headphones? 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.480
 Dan 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.660
 dancer 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:18.500
 So, why are you posting here? You can not call something "cancer" if you're on your own cancer! 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:26.120
 Can we hit the copyright of the game? Yes, Biodebay Krasena does it. I'm not upset 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.740
 I'm actually more very nice. But you can at the same time 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:39.180
 Whip movement and Na Na "Matt Pat", huh? Answer me on this. You can do this at the same time with the Nay Flute 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.160
 Will wait for your response 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.280
 Matt Pat tries to kill this planet 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.720
 Everyone knows that you can not charge a lot of energy at once. 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.920
 Can anyone please issue a better version of Pewbunga 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:55.240
 Oh my God 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:56.960
 Oh oh 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.160
 * Swedish Waffle * 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.900
 Click away? 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.360
 ..That hurts. 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.920
 Wooof and Wooof 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.620
 It was imminent 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:09.640
 This is why I have a gun that I trust to hide all the time if the Mim is too strong 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.560
 *Shooting * 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.560
 Must be destroyed 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:21.120
 Everyone is involved in this .. We can fool the people who review YouTube that this video is suitable for the family and comment on it by everyone .... 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.260
 Wonderful, I enjoyed watching this video with my son. We spent fun together 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:33.089
 Well, actually we did not have that much quality time together. In fact, I love my son now 

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:36.820
 In fact, I may love it a bit too much 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.700
 (Provist), damn it disgusting 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:44.760
 What do you cook in your pen? You do not clean out what all those white things are, yaar? 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:51.900
 Disappointing, disgusting, disgusting but also (provist) watching pirated movies being like 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:58.940
 Audio, video, audio, video and audio video, what a bad thing 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.540
 Mimz 2018 means can be summarized. It's like .. 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:12.260
 Just text anything on anything just put a text on anything, and it's M if you do not show the Rewind feature for YouTube 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.860
 Text Mimiz Layers. I just realize that this is the way to kill Mim. When the featured video was shown on YouTube Rewind 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.079
 Hahaha, is this .. 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.339
 15,000 people? 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.860
 She was just kidding about being persecuted abroad. It was just a joke 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.360
 Wait for this reply, by the way, I expect it. Clearly, young people. I do not want people to be persecuted abroad 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.480
 I just said that. I had a joke because I loved to be persecuted abroad by the way 15,000 people showed up 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:46.760
 My name is Connor. Hey, my God, I've come back for revenge. Well, I really need to play that game 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:53.020
 But I will, but I am good, I hope there will be some. "But will I?" 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.370
 That would make me happy 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:59.180
 But again, you guys are not creative, what if Peter Pyle played a piece and was unedited? 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.360
 Video Release There was a contest to see who would come with the best editing 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:05.080
 * Clapping clap * 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.580
 Review M 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.540
 * Clapping clap * 

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:07.040
 Bar Re 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.320
 Finally we came up with a way to replace Brad and Brad 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:20.049
 I do not have to put my original content. Great now. I do not even have to pay for the editors anymore 

00:05:20.049 --> 00:05:25.320
 I can only make Lance do it. that is great. I really liked the idea 

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:29.340
 I said first that you know that you said that first 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:35.380
 "Saif" was always his Mims. You need to pay more money to me Aubu Dubo Obo Dubo Obo Dubo Du 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:40.640
 Oh ya? When you start to bully the children and become distressed and to avoid it you ... 

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.400
 * Laughter * 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:48.300
 That was a really clever Mim good. The humor here of course is that I am now immersed. 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.100
 I mean I look better. There is no doubt about that. I sort of understand the paperwork now 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.800
 Jake Bulls has made a toast to something real 

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:00.920
 WAAAAALLLLLMMAAAAAARRRRRRRT 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:02.900
 is this real? that's cool, 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:10.480
 Today we will be absent - hey, it's all over, a full night and see what developers will do over the next few months including yes 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.280
 The Dragon in Fortnight 

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:16.000
 Jim Mood is new to what we will do with him 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.080
 * Song * 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:19.660
 Inter-channel Ali-A 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:20.180
 Yedo, Weiiidu, Yaidu, Yiyyido, Yaidu and Yiyyido 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.180
 Inter-channel Ali-A 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:30.020
 Another one, damn, see if you just invested in this stock of stock stocks, I'll be a millionaire 

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:35.920
 In addition, you know, I use insider information because I somehow do not understand 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.540
 Okay 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:42.900
 But certainly if you review the Mimes there should be some killing so MIM means that I can sell those mimes 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:45.120
 Does this sound logical? 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:47.040
 All women 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:50.080
 They are queens 

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.160
 Yup 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.620
 If she breathes 

00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:53.300
 No 

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.200
 It's a vaunted 

00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:56.980
 Christ the Savior 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:02.580
 Queen 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:03.360
 whore 

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.600
 Queen 

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.540
 whore 

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.160
 Queen 

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:06.900
 whore 

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:09.180
 The queen of a mischievous queen 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.060
 We did not need to struggle in the air, but the editing is very good 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:20.200
 By the way, a lot of people are doing a lot of effort in these stupid things. This is what makes Mim beautiful 

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:20.760
 Well done 

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:25.940
 Joe's average two-to-one whether she was a queen or a liar if she had headphones 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.680
 Are now dead or if they know how to properly install the sentence 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.070
 You did not part with the right of Christ and there are many video memes. I love that 

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:38.340
 Holding on to the next video mimes is a great job for making this Mim 

00:07:45.180 --> 00:07:47.340
 Are these all the things that I reviewed? 

00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:52.800
 Oh, I see that 

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.980
 What will you find? The group is supposed to be married 

00:08:06.060 --> 00:08:08.060
 Yes 

00:08:17.449 --> 00:08:24.119
 I never feel happy that a man needs to live forever. It is very important 

00:08:28.840 --> 00:08:30.840
 Hahaha 

00:08:37.140 --> 00:08:38.740
 Oh come on ... well hah 

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:46.960
 This is me i like i get it, can you make the whole movie full please just change the whole plot? 

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.960
 Well an article says good things about peace. this is good. I saw that 

00:08:51.140 --> 00:08:54.260
 Thank you Frank here "Namaste", I think he is the only one who actually 

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.490
 I have seen him 

00:08:56.490 --> 00:09:02.569
 Focus on it. I mean, it's like every article they've ever mentioned to me and they're attending all my bad past 

00:09:02.699 --> 00:09:09.438
 But they never mentioned any of this because it is not fitting for me to think of a fairly decent person 

00:09:09.860 --> 00:09:11.860
 I bet that the columns will love this tattoos 

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:19.310
 Well, I love Batman so this is fantastic. Oh, it's a good sign did not show thank you very much 

00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:21.310
 I will urinate through him 

00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:26.029
 Thank you very nice Brett bus driver 

00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:32.680
 Dr. Phil, I call it content. I'm sorry. I made three videos 

00:09:32.960 --> 00:09:34.960
 They were all a group of crying children 

00:09:36.180 --> 00:09:40.780
 I do not care 

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:48.500
 I'm not like those other YouTube users who say they love their fans. I say screw on you, admirers 

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:51.620
 "Epic James Sob Pop" 

00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:55.680
 Fortnight will play and he makes his own custom banner just get it if it's in place 

00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.100
 Is it true that I am a Fortnightly game once and I think it was a fun and attractive game 

00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:07.700
 But my pride was that it was very common. Well, they're okay from Donnie 

00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.880
 I think they will be fine. 

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.560
 This is actually a nice type. Do not make me feel bad 

00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:16.180
 Is it time to play Fortnight? 

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:24.160
 It is time to be able to bite the bullet and vilify my honor and believe in producing an hour-long video of high-quality content 

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.560
 Make a 10 minute video about 

00:10:26.699 --> 00:10:32.508
 The important issues are a 10-minute video about Mimat, which offers a 10-minute video about bean mummies 

00:10:32.509 --> 00:10:35.479
 But bored in the middle and just ask 

00:10:37.140 --> 00:10:43.300
 Practically to liberate this and get out of it and add a minute of peace 

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:48.900
 With music and accurate commercials 

00:10:49.449 --> 00:10:50.500
 Mark 10 minutes 

00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:55.409
 Felix really outdone himself in this brand. this is not true 

00:10:55.410 --> 00:11:00.029
 Well, you guys think you know me just because you mentioned me through Mim 

00:11:00.029 --> 00:11:04.559
 I mean, I can only record an hour-long video. And its high quality 

00:11:04.690 --> 00:11:09.299
 But I'll think about the things I upload every day. I'm sorry 

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:15.180
 Sometimes I am really busy with other things when life comes or whatever. I have other projects all that 

00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:19.349
 I work in the background and sometimes I feel sad because I do not have much time to put the video 

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:25.919
 Eight years each day eight years eight years. I'm sorry. I am sorry now you 

00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.180
 apologize to me 

00:11:28.180 --> 00:11:33.700
 Okay. I said sorry, sorry, is this a way out? 

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:40.100
 Listen, it's an innovative way to show how ASS plays the greatest game of all time 

00:11:40.100 --> 00:11:42.860
 Check that links in the description and enjoy 

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.500
 A for anime 

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:49.100
 B you can do this 

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.160
 C for Cuban Strike 

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:55.340
