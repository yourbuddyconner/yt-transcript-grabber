00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.100
 The translation is very complex and to prove it 

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:06.460
 I will read the introduction again after you have translated it through Google Translation 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.680
 - who is the best interpreter in the world - then I will translate it again 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.990
 "The translation is very difficult. 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.449
 - One of the best in the world - to prove it, after sending it to a translator Google .. 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:21.230
 I will read it again in advance " 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.949
 Well, I seem to have chosen a difficult language, but all the languages â€‹â€‹I've tried have made different mistakes. 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.859
 Chinese "translated by - hair - Google" In French, the introduction translated into 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.570
 "It is - for the sane" and not "this - for the non-wise." Although these sentences were very easy 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.420
 People who speak one language - and I'm embarrassed to be one of them .. I apologize for that - 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.079
 People who speak one language, usually think you can 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:46.710
 Open the translation dictionary .. Choose the appropriate words, and re-configure the sentence to fit the grammar 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.890
 This is expressed in a correct sentence in the corresponding language! For simple sentences .. yes, this is possible 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.840
 But the number of these sentences in the world is very few 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.980
 Google published his article on how they managed .. 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:06.679
 Transform the automatic translation into a differential equation in mathematics, and make it look for the content of the text in the large language space 

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:10.829
 Which is something new about trying to connect the destination to the individual, and also can deal with homogeneous words 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:15.560
 Similar words but vary in meaning .. You can understand their meaning through the context 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.320
 In the past, the phrase "water pump" was translated as "watercolor" 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.359
 When that method is used for official documents, it will work well 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.929
 But when using spontaneous conversations ... it will never be easy 

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:36.220
 Even the translation between British and American English is not always easy 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.660
 Not because the "bonnet" has two different names in American and British. 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.100
 But because the sentence "This is a great idea!" Not in English, 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.380
 It means that you are stupid and your mind is impossible! 

00:01:45.389 --> 00:01:50.929
 Sometimes, "destination" does not match the two languages, "Good Night" - French - 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:55.499
 Literally have the same meaning as "good night" - in Spanish - I apologize for speaking to them. 

00:01:55.499 --> 00:02:00.249
 One of them means - to become good - in the evening and the other used to say hello or goodbye 

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:03.259
 At any time after the absence of the sun 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:09.069
 There is also a "destination" that can not be translated between languages â€‹â€‹at all .. "You" in French 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:12.360
 It translates to "fu / y" but in official use 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.900
 And "you" if they are in informal and spontaneous use and even when talking to the Lord ... Yes, they use "to" with the Lord 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.750
 The machine will combine these two words into "you" when translating into a second language 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.120
 But you will not know the destination when you re-translate them into French 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.620
 This is simply a simple 'linguistic honor / respect' system. In Korean there .. 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:38.180
 Different pronunciation methods for all times and places. Remember these? Obba Gangnam Style 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:43.310
 The English translation of "Oba" usually means "Big Brother of Women" 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:48.079
 But in the colloquial language "Oba" is used to denote a person according to a series of complex and unclear laws 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:53.730
 But it has an obvious meaning to the speaker. To make it worse, Sai, 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.820
 Referring to himself in the form of the absentee .. This seems very strange when translating from the Korean language 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.280
 There is no way to translate the meaning of these Korean words into one English sentence. 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.760
 There is also the problem of common possibilities. 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.200
 Some countries in the world tend to be punctual 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.460
 If you book an appointment at 11, you are expected to arrive at approximately 11.00 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:22.290
 - Friends often can delay - "The concert begins at 6 pm" 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.340
 It means that guests will arrive between 6:30 and 9:00, but imagine this indulgence 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.280
 And also accept this indulgence in times spread to all aspects of life 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:38.219
 Welcome to the rest of the world! How much of this world 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:44.189
 He walks on a system called "flexible time". Two appointments at the same time? They will understand the situation 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:45.670
 ... They will understand it! 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.740
 Needless to say that there is a great cultural clash when the parties meet "flexible and precise dates" 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:55.489
 But the machine when you see an English sentence like 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:00.780
 "I'll see you at 7" you'll translate it without a noticeable note. "They really mean the seventh! .. 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:03.389
 They will be angry if you delay your appointment! " 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:08.580
 In conclusion, if you want to translate something accurately, you will not be able to know the connection of the word with the "destination" 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.380
 You must understand the community, the content, the differences, and the hints 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:18.370
 The common idea between the speaker and the future must be taken into account 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.920
 Both have faith in him and want to reach him with the vocabulary they have chosen 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.540
 Translators need to ask questions to the author 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:32.400
 And to ensure that the authors reflect his intention and intention 

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.610
 The problem is not that language is complex - computers can adapt to it. 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.099
 You can even solve "CAPTCHA" characters better than humans. The problem is that language 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:46.760
 Based on the intentions, the common secrets .. The identity of the speakers and also hidden knowledge among them. 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:49.880
 Do not misunderstand me, machine translation is a useful tool. 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.100
 But trying to make a machine better translated from a human is nothing but ... an idiotic idea 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.500
