00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.180
 I am in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.540
 How do I know this? It is in huge letters here on the dike. 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.680
 And this dike is located on the Mississippi River, the most important river in America. 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.540
 Not only because of the amount of water that flows through it, but because of the amount of freight. 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.840
 Look at all these ships here ... 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.320
 who are waiting to transport everything they have with them to the container ports ... 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.480
 and to the factories that are miles along this river. 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.640
 But there is a problem here, and something you may not know. 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.980
 The Mississippi River does not want to be here anymore. 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.760
 It's like this: about a hundred years ago, in the steamers' time ... 

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.480
 there was a bend in the river about 80 miles (129 km) from here, called Turnbull's Bend. 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.180
 And thus you sail 20 miles (32 km) to ... 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.980
 and of course, we are people, that is not possible. 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.520
 So a channel was built that cut off that bend. 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.580
 This, however, caused a problem. 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:56.920
 Hydrological - hydra - hydrol - hyda - that is a hard word to say! 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.780
 ... hydrological - hydrological - hydro ... 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.600
 ... Water modeling was not really a science back then. 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.560
 It was more a matter of just trying and looking at what works. 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.180
 So this new channel ... 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.600
 in combination with the removal of an accumulation of tree trunks on the Atchafalaya River ... 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.180
 meant that the Mississippi wanted to move. 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.080
 The river had found a much faster, steeper and quicker route to the sea ... 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.400
 Under the influence of gravity ... 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.900
 the Mississippi suddenly did not want to go this way anymore. 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.980
 He wanted to descend through the bed of the Atchafalaya River ... 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.900
 a very different route to the ocean ... 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.920
 and that is a big problem, because we have all these plants here, all the container ports, 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:35.420
 built on, and trusting on this river. 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.800
 Moving the Mississippi would cost America billions, perhaps a trillion dollars. 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.280
 That's why now, 80 miles upstream from here, 

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.600
 where Turnbull's Bend used to be, 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.380
 the "Old River Control Structure". 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 This was built by the engineers of the US Army, 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.220
 a truly fantastic group that is responsible for gigantic public works and dams in America. 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.880
 The Old River Control Structure ensures that the Atchafalaya River is dammed, 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:03.520
 stopped, 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.520
 and that 70% of the water that comes in ... 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.520
 still flows through the Mississippi. 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.920
 It is a battlefield, you could say, between people ... 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.520
 who try to make our world function ... 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.080
 and nature, who very much likes to choose her own way. 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.800
 So that was something you might not have known: 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.160
 the Mississippi River really does not want to be here anymore. 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.920
