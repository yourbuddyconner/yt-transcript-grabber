00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.009
 You probably already know that a rainbow does not consist of seven colors. Isaac Newton 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.559
 chose seven colors because it was mystical, it was related to seven musical notes, and 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.269
 the seven days that he thought God needed to make the earth. 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.150
 You probably already know that colors flow into each other. In contrast to this projection 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.870
 there is no pure red, or pure orange. In a real rainbow you see all wavelengths 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.810
 who are in between 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.289
 But what you might not know is that a rainbow does not disappear after red and violet. The 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.920
 electromagnetic wavelength goes a little bit in the invisible parts of it 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.340
 spectrum. Not very far: water absorbs infrared and ultraviolet. But you can see 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.989
 in what is an absorption spectrum that will let liquid water through - and thus 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.470
 Bringing to a rainbow - wavelengths just outside the frequency we can see. 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.780
 If you take a picture with a camera with UV-sensitive film, you can still have a bright beam underneath 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.890
 see violet. And there are people who do not wear lenses. They can 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.489
 still see, with strong glasses on, but the filtering of UV light that the lens does is gone. 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.070
 So they can also see that extra bar. A little further, in the National Gallery, are paintings 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.000
 by Claude Monet, who underwent surgery in his life that removed the lens from his eye 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.270
 therefore there is a fierce discussion that his paintings were brighter and bluer afterwards, 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.970
 the result of the almost UV light he could see at the time. 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.479
 There is one question: why does water only pass through the light 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.650
 that we can see? If it were something else, water would be cloudy for us, maybe we are constantly being hit 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.299
 by bright UV light, and then life would be very different. The answer 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.610
 is of course that it is no coincidence: for hundreds of millions of years, our predecessors 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.500
 these possibilities evolved. Our forces ensure that water is transparent in some 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.549
 wavelengths, so that we can see those waves is a big advantage in life. The species 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.840
 what we descended from would have had a much better chance of surviving if they could see those waves. 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.159
 Imagine that you can not look through the rain. Those who can not see those wavelengths, 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.360
 will die sooner. Repeat that for a whole bunch of generations and here 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.120
 are we: we create our own rainbows.
