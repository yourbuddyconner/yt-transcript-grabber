00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.940
 Today's show is sponsored by Druid's Fluids ... 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.180
 for all your holy water. 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.600
 This is the Technical Difficulties. We play Citation Needed. 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.860
 I have an almost randomly selected article 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.680
 everyone's favorite reliable source of information, Wikipedia, 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.680
 and these gentlemen can not see it. 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.180
 Every fact that they have good yields them a point and a thing [DING] 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:22.520
 and there is a special price for a specific good answer, namely 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.540
 "Rather"! 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.980
 And today we talk about ... the Bossche Bol. 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.160
 The what? 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.520
 Can you use that in a sentence for us? [Laughter] 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.980
 - Football! - No. 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:38.400
 We're talking about a sport, right? 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.740
 Not even in the neighborhood. 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:40.980
 Is it a type of ball? 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.700
 - Well. - Is it more or less ball shaped? 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:43.720
 Yes. It is more or less ball shaped. 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:44.860
 - Okay. - Is it a body part? 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.540
 No. 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.740
 Is it a seed, or fruit, or ... 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.080
 - It's something foody. One point for that. [DING] - Ahh! 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.520
 A Bossche Bol is therefore a form of food. 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.320
 Yes. 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.720
 Is it fried? 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:54.700
 Eh, no. 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:55.560
 What? 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:57.660
 Then it does not come from here. 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.500
 Is it made of parts of other things? 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.120
 It's food, right? 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.940
 Any kind of food, let's be honest, 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:07.700
 unless you talk about pure sodium ... 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:08.660
 Jum jum jum! 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.960
 ... is basically made from parts of other things. 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.660
 Yes. 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.440
 You have, for example, a fish pie, or you get fish. 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.940
 Okay! Eh, no, it's being made. It is made from other ingredients? 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.340
 Is it from Africa? 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.260
 It's Dutch! 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:26.480
 - Dutch? - Dutch. 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.300
 - Booshe-ball? - It's Dutch, and ... Bossche bol. 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.160
 Bossche sphere? 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.040
 Bossche sphere. Dutch acquaintances of mine are going to kill me for this ... 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.840
 Is it brine? 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.680
 No, not even in the neighborhood. Complete the other side of the spectrum. To be honest... 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:35.820
 So it's raw! 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.320
 If you had a spectrum - no, regarding taste - from pickle ... 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.280
 - Oh. - ... and then you go all the way to the other side ... 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:42.760
 - Okay, so it's something sweet. - Yes. 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.640
 Correct. It is a sweet treat - cake or something in that direction? 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:46.700
 Yes. 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.020
 [Laughter] And it is more or less ball shaped. 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.960
 Truffles. 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:51.920
 And I do not know why I do that. 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.280
 Is it sweet, pie-like Edam? 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.700
 - You know what ... - What, gostost? 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.580
 That is close enough to give you a point. 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.000
 [DING] It is actually too big a profiterole. 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.760
 - Ha! ...How big? - Jum jum jum! 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.900
 Too big. 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.060
 How big? 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.280
 As big as your head! 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.140
 You can put your head in and lick the cream on the inside 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.500
 you eat your leftovers. 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.660
 Like a helmet. 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.580
 Was that the beginning of the Dutch space program? 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.060
 With a gigantic profiterole on someone's head 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.460
 in the lower atmosphere? 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.260
 "Okay, the cream is feeding me." 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.060
 "I ate everything. I'm too fat for the parachute. " 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.020
 I am glad we finally joined 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.320
 the nationality that we are going to insult this show have come true. 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.360
 No, but, think about it. You can make the stripe of chocolate 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.360
 use it as a visor, right? 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.240
 Because the higher you go into the atmosphere 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.580
 the colder it gets, and the firmer it becomes. 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.600
 Okay, it does not survive the return to the atmosphere very well when it's chocolate, but you get it. 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.160
 You have the cream for insulation. 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.920
 Yes! 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.220
 ... I have not said that before. 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.380
 Again, once it is - yeah! 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.700
 They did have a point, this Dutch 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.480
 with their profiterole space program. 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.280
 You can put them in a giant Twinkie, 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.720
 or in a Barny Bear or something like a space suit. 

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.560
 So Bossche Bol was the name of their first space capsule? 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.120
 ... yes. Yes. [Laughter] 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.060
 Bossche Bol One! 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.640
 Yes. Absolutely. Like 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.420
 the first French spaceship was called 'Profiterole'. 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.440
 - Really? - No. 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.340
 - I did not know that. - It would not be called a Profiterole, you know that, stupid? 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.220
 - It was called 'Baguette'. - It was called 'Baguette'. 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.900
 Profiterols are small, duh! 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.160
 We are talking about one that is as big as a space helmet here! 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.680
 It is actually about one that is about five inches (13 cm). 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.140
 Slightly bigger than my button here. 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.480
 There is some culinary advice in this article ... 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.100
 What is the best way to eat a Bossche sphere without messing about? 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.220
 Sit on it. 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.580
 Eat it in its entirety. 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:33.400
 Drive it. 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.440
 Punctuation, sucking out his delicious inside 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.560
 and then eat the outside. 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.360
 Yes. 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:38.640
 Just like squeezing a pimple. 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.000
 [Pinch sounds] 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:51.040
 No? 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.540
 No, not surprisingly. 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:53.840
 With a spoon. 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
 The best way to prevent tampering with a Bossche sphere, 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.940
 That is the question you ask us. 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.780
 Yes that's right. 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.640
 Is there a special place for this? 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.900
 The Bossche sphere bulb, for example. 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.620
 I do not like messing with a Bossche sphere. 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.360
 - No, who does? - I'm not a fan. 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:07.240
 Vanish will not do anything with it, will he? 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:08.700
 You turn him on the head. 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.600
 Well, it actually says "The best way to prevent tampering 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.380
 is by eating the ball upside down ', 

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.200
 and I do not know if that means the bulb ... 

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.120
 - Or the person? - ... or the person. 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.840
 That's my kind of dessert. 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:20.100
 The kind you have to be bound for. 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.100
 That is the taste sensation that I am looking for. 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.360
 Okay, we have a three-person catapult 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:27.560
 and a Bossche sphere. Here we go! 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.940
 Yes! 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.340
 How would it feel to be touched? 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:33.560
 by a 13 centimeter wide profiterole on speed? 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.160
 Well, based on a juggling ball that I was hit by 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.520
 it is very painful. 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.320
 I was hit in my face by a water balloon. That was painful. 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.460
 Oh yeah! You kept a hefty member mark on it, did not you? 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.520
 I still have a GIF from somewhere. 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.520
 I'll see if I can stick it with this. 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.420
 I was thinking for a moment, what would the cream do? 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.540
 Would it ... Could it be .. 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.700
 Do not evaporate, but the action when it melts and ... 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.540
 I like to think that it becomes non-Newtonian. 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:56.960
 That it will get stuck and you will be simply unconsciously beaten. 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.680
 I want to believe that. That water balloon hurt. 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.680
 Oh, Jesus! If you would do that with one filled with custard, it would! 

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.140
 - Ohhh! - That will, or not? 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:04.620
 Because custard IS non-Newtonian! 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.180
 Only if it is not sugary. 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.940
 If you put sugar in it is just normal ... 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.240
 - Okay. - But it would still be enough to ... 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.340
 Wait a minute, we found a new weapon, people! 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:17.340
 If you were to put that in a loop marine frigate ... 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:20.580
 Because I saw that episode of Dad's Army 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:21.860
 where they fire onions on people 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.160
 and that looked painful, so I ... 

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:25.760
 Actually beating ballistics! 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.300
 Steel and depleted uranium - 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.900
 chocolate filled with custard. 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.080
 I'm not saying that is being used for destruction, 

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.980
 I say that it is used for shock and bewilderment. 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.900
 Splat and awe, right, or not? 

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:41.120
 There is a larger version of the Bossche sphere, to return to the topic ... 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:43.840
 The Super Bossche Bol! 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:45.340
 Well, look, you're not far wrong. 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.980
 I do not want the actual Dutch word for it, 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.400
 but you can tell me what it's called when you translate it into English. 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.840
 The Mega-Ball. 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.420
 The Whole Great Profiterole. 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.700
 You know, I'm just going to give you both points. It is 'giant globe'. 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.180
 [DING DING] 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.860
 What I like is that in the "See also" section of this page 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:02.360
 a 'List of cakes' 

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:05.160
 Let's see how much we can guess. 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:06.800
 Fast round! Name some pastries. Matt. 

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.580
 Ehm ... Coffee cake (Danish pastry). 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.360
 Point! [DING] Gary. 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:12.700
 Cream horn (Cream horn). 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:14.620
 - Oh my God. - Point! [THING] 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:15.980
 Cooking dough! (Choux bun) 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.040
 I tried to spell it here as a shoe and it did not work. 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.780
 That then! 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.340
 I will give you a point. It is under 'Éclair', but yes, point. [THING] 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.460
 Éclair. 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.140
 Point. [DING] [Laughter] 

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:29.160
 Viennese whirl. 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:30.440
 My God. 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:32.460
 No, is not on the list. 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:35.360
 NONSENSE! 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:38.540
 That is not a pastry. That's a biscuit. 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:41.200
 Ooh. Could you be right on the basis of a technical detail here. 

00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.900
 What I also like - on the list: 

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:44.580
 'Cronut' has already made it to Wikipedia. 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.160
 [Supports] Who eats that? I do not understand 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.100
 Me neither. What? 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.880
 Is it a croissant and a donut? 

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:52.160
 It is a donut made from croissant dough. 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:53.320
 But is not that normal 

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:55.000
 a croissant with a hole in the middle? 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.520
 No, it is fried instead of fried. 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.640
 Do you know those Yum Yums they have with Greggs? 

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.180
 - Oh, it's a Yum Yum, is not it? - It's one of them, yes. 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.960
 Only then with croissant dough. 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.040
 So more buttery and with multiple layers and stuff. 

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.760
 And it creates more crumbs on your shirt in the morning. 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:08.640
 The horror. 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:09.920
 I never thought, 'Ooh, I do not know 

00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:11.360
 whether I want a croissant or a donut. " 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.340
 - Somebody is. - I want one or the other. 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.320
 I do not understand the whole American breakfast, 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.580
 with donuts - 

00:07:16.580 --> 00:07:18.340
 something sweet and so sugary - as the first thing. 

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.260
 You ate Ricicles. 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.800
 Okay. 

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:25.240
 Oh man, Ricicles! With the little astronaut. 

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.240
 - Astronaut! - Captain Rik, yes! 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.740
 Jemig, are they still making it? 

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.080
 - Yes. - I honestly do not think so ... 

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:31.880
 - No. - I have not seen Ricicles for a long time. 

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.200
 On the other hand, if we find them ... 

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.520
 - Then we eat them. - I'll eat them tomorrow. 

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.420
 According to everyone, his favorite unreliable source of information, 

00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:38.940
 they still sell. 

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:40.000
 - Yes! - Ahhh! 

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:40.960
 In the United Kingdom? 

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.160
 However, they do not stop them in the variety packs. 

00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:45.000
 That's okay, I can handle a whole box. 

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:47.120
 - In one go! - What, just with your hands? 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.240
 From the box! 

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:51.240
 Well, you remember the box of Coco Pops that I took with me 

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:53.020
 when we did this last time. I ate them in two days. 

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.500
 I find a box of Ricicles at once a challenge. 

00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.420
 Fists full of Ricicles. 

00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.540
 - That's just a western movie! - For A Few Ricicles More. 

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:03.360
 The Good, The Bad and Captain Rik. 

00:08:05.100 --> 00:08:07.100
 Yes! All of them! 

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.140
 Just Coco the monkey, with a hat over his eyes, 

00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:14.380
 on the side, while he throws a knife. 

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.880
 And Tony the Tiger is the sheriff? 

00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:21.780
 There is a complete section on 'Controversy' in the Cronut article. 

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:24.660
 Can someone tell me how much they cost? 

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:28.040
 Because the original Cronut is a trademark of one bakery. 

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.300
 They sold them for five dollars. 

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:32.600
 For how many black traders did they sell later? 

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:34.840
 You can not - well, they do not last that long, do you? 

00:08:35.180 --> 00:08:36.840
 Because it is a French bread-based product 

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:38.600
 they would not be good within an hour. 

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.520
 Like we said before. 

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.480
 Yes. So I say twenty dollars. 

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.060
 Twenty dollars? Do you know... 

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:45.700
 Even though that is a terrible way to do it, 

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:47.200
 I'm going to apply the Price Is Right rules here. 

00:08:47.340 --> 00:08:49.780
 - Ohh! - So as close as possible without going over it? 

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:51.960
 Can we have that little yodelling man climbing a mountain here? 

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.420
 No. Twenty dollars? 

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.420
 - Yes. - Chris. 

00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:56.720
 Twenty dollars and 1 cent. 

00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:58.460
 - Ohhh! [Laughter] 

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.540
 Nine. 

00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:00.840
 Nine dollars. 

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:03.120
 Hundred dollars! [DING] You get a point. 

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.120
 Yes! 

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.980
 Go away! For a pastry ?! 

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:09.240
 It was such a thing, 

00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:13.300
 when the audience gets fixated on it, and it starts ... 

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:15.220
 Then it is in principle Bitcoin in pastry form. 

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:16.940
 You could fly to Paris for that! 

00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:18.000
 Only that takes longer. 

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.420
 ALL: Wahey! 

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:21.700
 Can someone give me some alternative names 

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:23.540
 for the Cronut, just to just ... 

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.540
 Donant! 

00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:25.360
 Fatty Wheel! 

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.320
 Flaky Death! 

00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.160
 Fat Whirl! 

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:28.320
 Fat Whirl. No. 

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.020
 Dosant? 

00:09:29.180 --> 00:09:30.560
 Dosant! Point. [THING] 

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.960
 Is not that selling close to nothing? (English wordgrap) 

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:35.380
 Also on the list of pastries, 

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:37.620
 are 'Nun's Puffs'. 

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.600
 Brannan! I feel that this is your ... 

00:09:41.880 --> 00:09:43.420
 - Hallooo? - Please make a nun sequitur of it. 

00:09:43.620 --> 00:09:45.220
 - [Steunt] - Heyyy! 

00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:47.880
 'Nun sequitur' - that really took me about three seconds. 

00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.180
 That was good. 

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.880
 Oh, do not walk around like that! 

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.200
 I have been on that list for years 

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:56.940
 and that's the first time I could use it! 

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:59.260
 You are lucky, because you were very nonchalant when you made it. 

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:00.740
 [Kreunt] 

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.700
 That's not a habit you want. 

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:04.380
 [Laughter] Now ... 

00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.020
 I leave you in a corner if you keep doing that! 

00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:07.860
 [Kreunt] 

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.780
 It stands as 'nun's puffs'. 

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:11.540
 That is a euphemism. Can you tell me what they are actually called? 

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:13.880
 I have read about this! It is.. 

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.660
 Are those little round sandwiches 

00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.020
 with glaze and a cherry on top? 

00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:18.180
 Eh ... Not the cherry, 

00:10:18.180 --> 00:10:20.180
 but they are basically light pastry dough. 

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.000
 Are they those who have the name 'Nun's Farts'? 

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.940
 Point! [Stuff... 

00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:29.040
 They are called 'nun's farts' ... [Laughter] 

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.600
 ... and are simply a ball of dough 

00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:33.700
 which is very, very light and which is filled with cream. 

00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:35.200
 So, profiteroles? 

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:37.200
 - ... but smaller. - Under another name, yes. 

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.440
 Sorry... 

00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:40.660
 "Can you be a fool, please?" 

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.580
 'Of course. Sister!' 

00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:46.640
 "That's five pounds, please." 

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:49.060
 And then you sell it later for a hundred. 

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.220
 In a jar. 

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.120
 Speaking of that, I believe, Matt, that you have the most points - 

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:55.780
 I mean, I'll be honest, I'm not counting. 

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.840
 I do not have one anyway, so it was not me this time. 

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160
 Matt, congratulations - you win a game 

00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:03.200
 where you have the employees of a disgraced bank 

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.420
 have to jump through pipes and let Bowser beat. 

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.240
 Super Lehman Brothers. 

00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:13.120
 That's right! Enough time has passed before that. We're okay. 

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.720
 Until the next time ... that was Matt Gray! 

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.440
 Bye-bye! 

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.520
 That was Gary. 

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.420
 ... Brannan! I did not say your name there. 

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:20.040
 What a stupid, everyone (!) 

00:11:20.520 --> 00:11:22.520
 We now work together for, well, how long? 

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.960
 Go away, stupid. 

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.500
 CHRIS: That was Gary Brannan ... 

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:27.320
 And that was Chris Joel. 

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.620
 Bye! 

00:11:28.620 --> 00:11:30.400
 I have ... Ah, leave it! 

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.340
 Look at his face! 

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.260
 That was a good cake delivery, I liked it. 

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:44.620
 [Laughter] 

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.240
 Thanks for looking! 

00:11:46.360 --> 00:11:48.360
 If you have come here then you will hopefully enjoy the show. 

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:49.640
