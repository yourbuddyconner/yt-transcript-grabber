00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.240
 Some people may be testing the Flex ™ shutter in a bucket! 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:04.700
 Ooh 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:07.080
 Do not try this 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:10.320
 Tell her, Phil. 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:11.580
 Say it. 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.740
 This is a lot of damage 

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:13.380
 Ooooh 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:14.280
 What's more? 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:15.460
 Okay. 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.880
 * Phil Swift has become crazy. * 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.000
 * Drilling noise * 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.480
 Oh my God, do not try this !!!!! 111! 1111 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:25.820
 Wow, Phil looks like - 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.880
 Too much damage, thank you, everyone. 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.320
 This is true I - Jesus Christ .. 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.520
 Well, I'm doing a video on Flex Tape ™, that's right. 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.340
 I first did it 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.820
 Thank you for understanding the fact that I have brought out new ideas. What is the - 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.480
 * * Stuttering 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.580
 Then, who knows? 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.980
 Now for Real, check out JonTron's video. Make a video on Flex Tape ™. I got the views of a couple 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.360
 I do not know. I do not count views anyway ... 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.269
 Also, John did not upload them in five months! 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.820
 However, there are more Flex ™ videos to review for everyone 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.380
 Hooray! 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.229
 So, let's go through them. Yes, this 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:04.660
 What will you do? I want... 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.840
 Whatever the day comes out 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.760
 Now, if you are not familiar with the fancy word for Flex ™ Tape ™ 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.580
 Let me do a quick offense. There is this really above the top 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:25.019
 Commercials do with the same tape god elephant and give you an example. "I'm Phil Swift here to get a flexible tape 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.659
 Super waterproof tape 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.769
 It can immediately break, document, close and handle. " 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.600
 The incredible right? I want him to slap my ass just like that 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.875
 Then I want to seal my heart with a flex tape. (I ship PhiLix Phil x Felix) 

00:01:45.875 --> 00:01:47.859
 The flex tape is not a normal bar 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.460
 It's a thick adhesive triangular practically seams itself on the surface 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.340
 Instantly stop the most difficult leaks 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.149
 Now, they always do something very great in the end to explain how, how powerful the elastic band is. 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.625
 In this one. He saw a physical hat 

00:02:04.625 --> 00:02:07.449
 To show you the strength of the flex tape 

00:02:07.449 --> 00:02:13.240
 (WOAHH THATSALOTTADAMAGE) 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:19.400
 I saw this boat in its half and repaired it with a flex tape only 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.960
 It is impossible to work 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.449
 Right, not only this strong adhesive tape flex, hold the boat together 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.740
 But it creates a strong waterproof seal. Oh ya 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.399
 Well, I bet it does not dry completely from the inside. The interior is completely dry 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.160
 Well, they now offer a new product called click bar. Let's check it out for everyone 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.649
 Hi, Phil Swift here for a clear flexible bar. Super waterproof tape 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.980
 This is the best way to correct bonds 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:58.419
 Repair the seal! Flex Tape Clear. Yes. Yes. Well, but will you see a boat in half or what is Phil? 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.910
 I only care if you see something in half 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.689
 To show you the strength of the clear flex tape 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.410
 (THATSALOTTADAMAGE) 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:15.200
 I cut a giant hole in another boat (in another boat!) With only a clear elastic strip 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.710
 pods: Wow! My God. 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.749
 pods "Keep all the water out of the boat": Yes? Well, I bet you 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.740
 This boat will not run over water full of sharks 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.760
 But even the infested shark 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.889
 Water is a wide waterproof barrier that seals the elements and you can see right through 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:39.740
 And you can see right through 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.060
 When the shark attacks, O Phil, you are a crazy man. You are a totally crazy boy Christ Jesus 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.240
 (Crusade Crusade 2k18) 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.260
 How I wish I could ride the sunset would prove the elephant only the strength of the flex tape 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:02.569
 We seal the ocean. We seal everyone Pacific. What will he do next? 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:08.690
 There is nothing that this guy will not do to show the strength of the flex tape. "To show you amazing 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:16.160
 Seal the flex seal power, put the bottom of this boat with the screen door and cover it in the flex seal. why? 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.219
 To show the strength of the flex tape 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.859
 Put the door on the boat just to show the strength of the flex tape 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:31.279
 But inside the elephant completely dry? On the water 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.829
 Not only do they remain floating, but the inside is completely dried out 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:38.930
 Wonderful, wonderful. at all 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.799
 Wonderful. "To show you the incredible power of a flexible fire 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.830
 I will blow huge gaps at the bottom of this boat with this giant cannon. Ready? 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:56.880
 (Woah Phil, please calm down) (Hi, I'm Renwa Elisse, im back''all) 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.020
 Why does this man hate boats so much? Phil, please 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.860
 Holy * dEMoNiTIzED * 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.370
 THAT'SALOTTADAMAGE 

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.269
 A black shot (?) Sealed each hole 

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.819
 But the hole in my heart is not an elephant 

00:05:18.069 --> 00:05:21.569
 Not the opening in my heart. "To show you the strength of flexible glue, 

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.939
 None of these parts are flexible and stick together 

00:05:29.699 --> 00:05:31.699
 He built Felix 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.600
 Monster 4x4! pods: Jesus Christ, Phil! 

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.420
 Will someone stop this man 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.539
 why are you doing that? Hi Phil Swift here for flex seal colors 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.070
 Colored way to coat, seal and stop leaks quickly 

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:49.850
 The flexible sealing colors are the same as the original sealing strength 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:56.059
 Now the vibrant colors can transform and protect almost anything literally 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.560
 Your marriage is broken 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:01.759
 Your arm is broken and your arm is depressed 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:08.329
 Flexible seal colors will fix any problem you have. The thick colors dry the thick flex to water 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:14.509
 Flexible rubber coating. Phil, I just have a dish. You just made a pot without a reason 

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:18.799
 How will you get your pasta now? This quick shot fills the cracks and holes 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:22.399
 Stop the most difficult leaks while maintaining full flexibility 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:28.849
 I use a brown sealed flex to close the rear and no one can tell the difference now 

00:06:28.889 --> 00:06:34.698
 Thanks to the sealed stamped brown. thank you. It's actually liquid rubber. wait. This is liquid rubber 

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:39.560
 This is. That's all you sell me? Seal outdoor decorative elements 

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:43.760
 Oh my God, Phil, you've just literally killed a point to prove 

00:06:44.789 --> 00:06:51.769
 You've taken a very far away elephant. Forget the thin machine gun. All right, definitely seal the flex seal, whatever it is 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:54.330
 I've seen your elephant stunt boat 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.190
 What can you do please? 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:03.229
 Please oh wow because there is nothing going to me wow at this point. To show you the incredible power of flex seal 

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:05.479
 We took this old truck 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.270
 What will you do - certainly. 

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:19.980
 Phil What are you doing by car? It's the coolest thing I have ever seen! My love 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.520
 Everyone made the submarine a flex seal! Red, blue and green 

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:31.300
 It is the coolest sub-you've ever seen. Massive, well done 

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:35.340
 We want to know how flexible you are sealing and how to use a flexible shot 

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:43.060
 Send your photos and you have the chance to win the prize pack in the end. Wonderful. I can win the final prize 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:50.560
 What is that? Do not they say is it an appointment with Phil himself? So they did this contest where you can deliver during the praise 

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:56.260
 Apparently someone had made their boat. Someone will give his dead body dead my grandmother 

00:07:56.260 --> 00:08:03.789
 I just sprayed it with a flexible seal as if I always remember it. My favorite flex seal is to be 

00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:08.739
 Christmas business because they are trying to sell a flexible seal as a 

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:16.539
 Christmas gift for someone. Phil Swift is here in this festive season giving the family a flexible product 

00:08:17.510 --> 00:08:19.510
 Everyone loves flex seal 

00:08:22.580 --> 00:08:24.580
 Now I can sprinkle shit off you 

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:33.700
 The stunning sealing fluid starts with a super thickening and turns into a strong flexible rubber 

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:40.420
 Wow thanks Dad! You got me some elastic elastic dad! I love you dad! Thank you so much! 

00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:44.760
 Everyone loves flex seal. Oh, I kind of want to dip the human into the flex seal 

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.690
 I just want to know what's going on, you know 

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:54.249
 Hi, Phil Swift is here to blow the strong spray that melts the ice quickly! To prove the strength of it 

00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:01.780
 Explosion we launched global warming with bangs! (Lol) Just a quick blast melt snow and ice quickly 

00:09:02.030 --> 00:09:04.030
 Even this weak fabric 

00:09:06.020 --> 00:09:13.840
 Keep dry with power outage. I made an elephant cloth. Now what do I suppose to use the handkerchief? 

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.900
 If you can not erase anything 

00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:24.310
 Innovation everyone. Phil does it better. Some people may have experienced flex testing on a bucket 

00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:26.349
 But you did not see anything like me 

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:36.079
 First of all, no, no. I have not seen anyone stab a bucket to prove the flexible sealing point 

00:09:36.079 --> 00:09:38.659
 I do not think this is what people do 

00:09:40.379 --> 00:09:45.979
 Out of curiosity. Come here look at this, this is wonderful 

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.880
 This is not great, this is a lot of damage 

00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:03.820
