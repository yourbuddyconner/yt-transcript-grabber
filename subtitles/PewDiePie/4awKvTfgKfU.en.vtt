 Meatballs (in Swedish)

 That's right, I'm doing cooking videos now. Can you do my job? 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.320
 We will make meatballs 

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:11.220
 To celebrate these new goods designed by myself 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.340
 That's true 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.000
 Do you like Marzia? 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.780
 Look at the shirt not for my ass 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.040
 Well you look at my ass, but no one else can! 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:23.700

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.640
 I will tell you as confidential 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.520
 We have meat

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.340
 We have butter 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.780
 We have bread crumbs 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.020
 We have Stoke Putinek 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.800
 We have onions, potatoes, and Swedish jam 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:43.760
 Let's go, okay 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.800
 To see if you remember how to cook this .. 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.660
 You need this you need soy 

00:00:53.665 --> 00:00:56.385
 number one 

00:00:56.385 --> 00:00:59.515
 Wash your hands This is true for anyone who wants your germs intimate 

00:00:59.515 --> 00:01:01.145
 In your cheese 

00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:07.905
 Do you wash your hands all the time Marzia 

00:01:08.885 --> 00:01:11.825
 Marzia oh let me think this is true 

00:01:12.575 --> 00:01:15.135
 Why do I feel now that they are Marzia? 

00:01:15.135 --> 00:01:18.145
 I will do this if I have not 

00:01:18.145 --> 00:01:21.145
 Perfect for you to learn to control 

00:01:21.145 --> 00:01:22.355
 Secret question 

00:01:23.545 --> 00:01:26.545
 It will be perfect. 1. Cutter. Do not hide all your things for a woman 

00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:31.545
 Do you have a real sharp knife? 

00:01:31.545 --> 00:01:32.485
 Marzia: Yes 

00:01:34.015 --> 00:01:36.935
 This is not a sharp Marzia knife 

00:01:36.935 --> 00:01:39.665
 Marzia I think I used it so badly if it is not a dishwasher 

00:01:40.085 --> 00:01:41.085
 Lala where all these cups come from 

00:01:42.845 --> 00:01:44.725
 But this is not for cutting 

00:01:45.085 --> 00:01:48.115
 a woman 

00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:52.895
 Edgar = (his dog) is an assistant 

00:01:57.955 --> 00:02:00.915
 I do not know how to cut onions 

00:02:00.915 --> 00:02:02.465
 If he calls me, I will tell you how to cut him off, but the first is true 

00:02:03.195 --> 00:02:06.085
 There are many ways. You were worried: no 

00:02:06.735 --> 00:02:08.985
 This knife is terrible 

00:02:11.635 --> 00:02:13.535
 Oh Wow I was right Marzia 

00:02:14.245 --> 00:02:15.985
 Congratulations 

00:02:16.475 --> 00:02:17.855
 Oh yeah that's very good 

00:02:20.135 --> 00:02:22.635
 Yes, cut these things, then cut the onion on half of it, then peel it 

00:02:27.165 --> 00:02:30.305
 Yes, but I want to see how you do it 

00:02:30.305 --> 00:02:32.935
 You know the cubes from outside are actually cut off by all the cubes 

00:02:32.935 --> 00:02:36.095
 This is not a secret trick 

00:02:36.095 --> 00:02:39.275
 Yes you know a secret trick 

00:02:39.275 --> 00:02:42.265
 There's a secret trick Edgar knows 

00:02:42.265 --> 00:02:45.625
 Edgar knows it and he signs it 

00:02:46.135 --> 00:02:47.885
 These two tricks I would have been buzzing with onions 

00:02:48.645 --> 00:02:51.595
 Add this flavor but you do not want to have a good onion smell 

00:02:51.595 --> 00:02:54.625
 You want to cut it very small literally just add onion flavor 

00:02:57.665 --> 00:02:59.935
 Do you know what to say? Let us cut the bulb on half 

00:03:00.325 --> 00:03:02.065
 I do not like onions much 

00:03:05.895 --> 00:03:07.065
 what are you laughing at 

00:03:07.945 --> 00:03:09.785
 You really are crying 

00:03:10.385 --> 00:03:12.945
 Yes onions make me shed tears This does not mean it makes me cry 

00:03:12.945 --> 00:03:15.885
 This is a great knife 

00:03:15.885 --> 00:03:18.735
 I will just destroy this onion 

00:03:18.735 --> 00:03:20.675
 Yes that's right 

00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:24.755
 So you can always make a good cooking presentation 

00:03:24.755 --> 00:03:27.255
 Reimsi Go From Here The Other 

00:03:27.485 --> 00:03:30.595
 You too 

00:03:30.595 --> 00:03:33.845
 Is this food cooked by Felix? 

00:03:33.845 --> 00:03:36.875
 This has not happened before. The real man to cry when he cuts onions 

00:03:36.875 --> 00:03:39.525
 No big tears to my face Marzia 

00:03:39.525 --> 00:03:40.995
 Not a single tear 

00:03:44.785 --> 00:03:47.815
 Why am I doing this? 

00:03:47.815 --> 00:03:50.685
 Take a little time but learn that it's worth it Well it's worth it when we grab 

00:03:50.685 --> 00:03:53.745
 Cooker and we will put this oh that's wrong 

00:03:53.745 --> 00:03:56.015
 Uh 

00:03:56.705 --> 00:03:59.335
 Put this in. Take a little bit of butter to learn our Italian girl 

00:03:59.335 --> 00:04:02.055
 Oh put it with olive oil Felix 

00:04:02.305 --> 00:04:05.725
 Provocative words 

00:04:05.885 --> 00:04:07.845
 Yeah 

00:04:09.455 --> 00:04:11.415
 Let's clean this onion 

00:04:12.295 --> 00:04:15.475
 German words 

00:04:15.475 --> 00:04:18.405
 Let's do something 

00:04:18.405 --> 00:04:21.365
 This is you. Look at the onions to see this 

00:04:24.425 --> 00:04:27.705
 My girlfriend 

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:31.835
 At the same time we cook too 

00:04:32.265 --> 00:04:35.365
 I do not work any other need 

00:04:38.285 --> 00:04:41.155
 Wash the dishes after the dishwasher 

00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:43.675
 I prefer the knife 

00:04:43.675 --> 00:04:46.285
 Thank you 

00:04:48.235 --> 00:04:50.975
 So .. I am trying to solve it Mdnnach dissolved .. In the dish I use it 

00:04:54.675 --> 00:04:56.765
 I add my bucket 

00:04:57.545 --> 00:05:00.585
 Better vegetables is definitely the best thing 

00:05:00.585 --> 00:05:03.605
 Horick is the best thing 

00:05:03.605 --> 00:05:06.675
 The creamy cream of a brick is simple 

00:05:14.425 --> 00:05:16.855
 Bring the cream 

00:05:17.645 --> 00:05:19.945
 Bring the toast 

00:05:20.455 --> 00:05:23.825
 This is all that is written by Sawa 

00:05:23.825 --> 00:05:26.745
 If you prefer a guest bread if you light the guest cream as you like 

00:05:26.745 --> 00:05:29.725
 I wore a uniform 

00:05:29.725 --> 00:05:32.885
 If you prefer a guest bread if you light the guest cream as you like 

00:05:36.325 --> 00:05:39.825
 Deloitte Hnosch our hands 

00:05:39.955 --> 00:05:40.955
 Ahaherhaha 

00:05:41.065 --> 00:05:42.925
 A wonderful sense of awe, Owei 

00:05:48.045 --> 00:05:49.325
 Ajbaki 

00:05:51.505 --> 00:05:54.355
 This is why I wanted to solve it 

00:05:57.595 --> 00:05:59.315
 I have made a great one 

00:05:59.315 --> 00:06:01.965
 That is why 

00:06:01.965 --> 00:06:03.145
 That is why 

00:06:04.285 --> 00:06:06.755
 It is possible to make the ball full of shape minus something to taste 

00:06:06.755 --> 00:06:09.785
 Its taste is not enough 

00:06:09.785 --> 00:06:12.820
 Salt and pepper 

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.920
 Its taste remains the same, but it remains two years later 

00:06:14.925 --> 00:06:17.435
 I forgot to tell you you need to get potatoes if Matarvish I know you Haha 

00:06:20.715 --> 00:06:21.665
 I am old, I am a thief, and I am cooking 

00:06:21.665 --> 00:06:24.195
 Haha Well it's the happiness of what every step is done by doing it 

00:06:24.195 --> 00:06:27.305
 My love you are tired 

00:06:32.675 --> 00:06:35.295
 Deloitte is a small chore 

00:06:35.295 --> 00:06:38.175
 Hankour Ahh 

00:06:38.175 --> 00:06:39.645
 See this 

00:06:40.085 --> 00:06:41.255
 Nice 

00:06:41.635 --> 00:06:43.785
 Meatballs Sandwiches 

00:06:44.125 --> 00:06:47.045
 I do not know how to cook 

00:06:52.535 --> 00:06:54.375
 Maybe if you have an old meat 

00:07:05.335 --> 00:07:08.835
 Hankour meat and wait for the potatoes to climb 

00:07:09.075 --> 00:07:11.935
 He wants to raise the fire to a degree, so that the potato will level and end after what is leveled 

00:07:11.935 --> 00:07:14.955
 Delighted meat with freshly cut butter 

00:07:19.645 --> 00:07:22.775
 Delighted meat with freshly cut butter 

00:07:23.195 --> 00:07:26.255
 He used two pastimes when he was done 

00:07:26.255 --> 00:07:27.255
 But you work a little bit 

00:07:32.665 --> 00:07:35.245
 You bettkhely every day like a hard woman 

00:07:40.625 --> 00:07:42.015
 We will put them on fire 

00:07:43.245 --> 00:07:45.885
 As the letters of the letters are ringing, we turn them along 

00:07:47.545 --> 00:07:49.545
 Beautiful Oi ... Shoufi Keda 

00:07:50.215 --> 00:07:52.465
 Jamieleh to ferment Ahi 

00:07:55.995 --> 00:07:58.685
 I am happy with them 

00:07:59.415 --> 00:08:00.885
 Its shape is reddened 

00:08:01.435 --> 00:08:04.385
 As soon as we got to know them, the potatoes remained 

00:08:04.385 --> 00:08:07.365
 So we use the latest cream cream 

00:08:08.825 --> 00:08:10.145
 On the fire of Hadia, they were thrown in the bass on the butter 

00:08:10.695 --> 00:08:12.675
 Let it fall like this 

00:08:14.205 --> 00:08:17.205
 We are giving soy sauce ... because its shape is darker 

00:09:05.045 --> 00:09:07.285
 They are mummified on them 

00:09:07.725 --> 00:09:10.925
 Beautiful and delicious 

00:09:14.195 --> 00:09:16.165
 here we are 

00:09:19.235 --> 00:09:22.465
 With such a wonderful look 

00:09:25.385 --> 00:09:27.315
 It's a delicious sweetie and it's awesome 

00:09:30.815 --> 00:09:32.065
 I can eat your tea 

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:34.845
 Yeah 

00:09:35.795 --> 00:09:37.385
