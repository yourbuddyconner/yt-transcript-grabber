00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:05.250
 In Britain, the words "spare bus services" are not what you would like to hear. 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.940
 It means that the train you want to go to is not going anywhere 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.099
 and instead everyone has to drive a slow and noisy bus, 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.969
 which way will last at least twice as much and will be much less comfortable. 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.090
 If you have already left the first station, 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.350
 then the railway company is obliged to bring you to your destination ... 

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.890
 but about how quickly, there is no rule anymore. 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.850
 Spare buses are the nightmare of every traveler. 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.780
 And that's why I was surprised to find out that for a few days 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.750
 things turned: 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:34.149
 Here, between two remote villages in the Scottish Lowlands, 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:39.089
 a very rare spectacle appeared: a spare train for the bus. 

00:00:39.089 --> 00:00:45.030
 - According to the normal schedule, it runs every weekend, usually from Easter to the end of September. 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.019
 The idea of ​​a substitute train service came from discussions 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:52.829
 among some villagers and volunteers on the track, 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.719
 and when we realized that there would be enough volunteers to run throughout the week, 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:02.120
 we have developed a schedule and now we have a full day service. 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.860
 - B797, the tiny road between Leadhills in South Lanarkshire 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.720
 and Wanlockhead in Dumfries and Galloway, 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.500
 is closed for repairs. The detour takes about 45 minutes on the road ... 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.180
 but by chance there is a volunteer narrow-gauge railway that connects them. 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.060
 - Everyone here is a volunteer, there are no paid employees in Leadhill. 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.240
 We are all here in our spare time. 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.700
 Tomorrow I will be a conductor, but today I am a driver. 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.200
 We have all possible other duties. 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.430
 - They're using those people going to the doctor, 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.350
 people commuting to work at the lead mining museum, 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.790
 and a few more places. 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.820
 And yes, it looks a bit mad, 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.610
 but you know what? It works. 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.610
 And it's not often when you come across a violation of your route, 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.250
 which will improve your day. 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.780
 - The remarks were great this week. 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.450
 We like it for villagers and we have several extra tourists, 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.600
 who normally would not travel during the week. 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.159
 So it's a good promotion of the route, 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:01.650
 and it helps the villagers! 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:04.750
 - Thank you all to the railways in Leadhills and Wanlockhead! 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.650
 If you watch this video on the day of uploading to YouTube or the next one, 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.090
 you still have a chance to go through this service! 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.780
 Details and link are in the video label, 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.590
 along with the dates when steam trains travel this summer on this route.
