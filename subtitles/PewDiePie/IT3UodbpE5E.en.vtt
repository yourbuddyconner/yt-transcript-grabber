00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:01.920
 Grilled tomatoes here 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.160
 how are you all? 

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.360
 Yes, take only 5 minutes 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.340
 Badinga. (Supposed to say Bazinka ..) 

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.640
 I went back inside 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.780
 Where I belong. 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.280
 You know, wherever you talk to people online 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.860
 Who probably do not know who I am. 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.639
 I always hit with: 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.820
 Pfft (high grade sound) happened. Yes, this has happened completely. 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.620
 Sure you met that person. 

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:20.860
 Yes, I did, young people, 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.980
 It's me, 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.080
 It's you, you guys, I'm in Bidebay. (Soft voice) 

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.100
 Why do not you believe me? ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.980
 When I find out why people treat me with this insult, 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.820
 This disrespect, 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.900
 The reason for this is the existence of a Redit page based on the publication of these allegations. 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.620
 Okay? 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.660
 I am in Bidebay. 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.500
 I promise you 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.620
 Stop. 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.880
 So let's review the top posts on the page (definitely this happened) 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.340
 You and I, together. 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.060
 (Explosion) Smash the admiration button. 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.300
 I went to the mart 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.860
 To buy a tray of cake dough and a pack of stopper as 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.340
 A 17-year-old boy was staring at my body 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.780
 Just looked at me and said everything would be fine. -Another response- 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.719
 Well said by the way, I am 17 years old 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.829
 I want you to know that so you can descriptive in your fake text post on Tombler 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:15.720
 Basinga, that's right. How can she know that his age was 17? Hmm. I feel that Templer surfers are doing this 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.979
 Especially I'm a little understand it now I took one leaf and I mean it's easy 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:22.109
 We are supposed to take everything in nominal terms 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:27.839
 No, no, not me. I am educated. I visit Reddit from time to time 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.780
 I was in the bank with my five-year-old sister when we heard: "All of us!" 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.199
 We all stayed except for my sister who says 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.009
 The theft is wrong 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.359
 From now on I know that the story will be fantastic 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.279
 The thieves withdrew and everyone stood and clapped. The bank manager gave us 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:54.989
 1000 pounds to save the day. - emoji laugh imogi laugh emoji laugh- 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.449
 It is possible to be whoosh you know, it is clear that the story falsely intended correctly? - You were deceived by my friend - 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.479
 I like these tweets from the documented accounts 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.580
 Everyone dies one day, everyone, even bulls. But not books 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:16.899
 No words. Words do not die. - I wrote before: My 3 year old son is much smarter than me 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.240
 It should be nice to have a three-year-old imaginative person. You do not need to change diapers. 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.859
 Wonderful. It's like, oh I have this pretty decent gimmick. What if I gave it to my three-year-old, it would be amazing. 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.650
 In fact this page quit your bullsh * t. 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.000
 But as you know, 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.300
 You know that this is true if you start it "literally". I have been denied Camouflage Pants from my old school because, 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.649
 People continued to make invisible jokes and one teacher suffered a mental breakdown and decided to resign because of them. 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.580
 Yes, teacher 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.690
 He decided to leave school because people continued making camouflage jokes. 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.579
 I understand him, this is what the teacher knows 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:02.150
 My English teacher wrote part of a poem I wrote on the painting today, 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:08.980
 Which really surprised me. She asked the students to guess from her books, and most of the answers were: "President." 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.049
 Or "Shakespeare". When the teacher announced that I am from his books 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.280
 I got applause and then the president came himself to bless me. 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:27.429
 Shakespeare of death said: "Well done, this." I have not been lying all my life 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.179
 This will not happen to me. You will never see PewDiePie on this page. 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:38.140
 Teacher: I want everyone to write people who inspire you. * The teacher walks and looks at the paper. 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:44.290
 Teacher: Who are these people with colored hair? Anna: They're YouTubeers. Teacher: They're not really inspiring people 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:50.709
 They sit at home and talk to the camera all day long. 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:55.419
 Me: You stand all the time talking to children who do not care about you all day long 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000
 * I continue to write the names of UTOPERS " 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.709
 This is another one for PewDiePie. I pulled my pants down and pushed them on the screen 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:10.750
 Then my mother entered and I said: 

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:16.179
 Mom do not look at me PewDiePie told me to do. What you really have to say is Mom looks at me 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:23.119
 This happened entirely while shopping at Target. I heard a girl say that the boys are very stupid 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:31.188
 I answered: "I say it louder to the girls in the back." 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.639
 Customers responded with a slow clap better 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:37.370
 Best Marit experience in Target 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:41.899
 Yet the boys are very stupid. Can this video arrive? 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:48.559
 5,000 Likes? The boys are very stupid but if she said: women are stupid 

00:04:48.629 --> 00:04:54.408
 Do not call me to comment on the hypocrites. You will not bother right? you are pathetic 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.960
 Oh my God, I asked this girl in my class about a piece of gum 

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:02.688
 Every day for the entire semester 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:08.959
 Today was my last day and I asked about gums and gave me a full package as a 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:13.219
 Parting a gift if it is not something soft I have seen it 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:17.119
 So I wrote her number on each piece of gum number one 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:21.889
 How do you know the number two order that did not happen? Are you a virgin? 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:24.739
 Something similar happened to me the other night 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:32.718
 My taxi driver had my life by $ 0.50, Eminem asked me and asked me if I wanted to change it to 

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:40.849
 The country to which you responded by wrapping the rest of the song lyrics. Then a taxi dressed 

00:05:42.149 --> 00:05:47.869
 Even if it happens, it's just crisp. I do not care if that happens. What about that? How about 

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:49.759
 Side subreddit you 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:57.679
 If I lose this bet I will eat my physics professor who started losing the bet by taking his hat 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.759
 Dissolves in acid 

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:07.549
 Neutralizing them with a base, making them pour water in their coffee and in their cup more 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:11.628
 It certainly happened as one teacher of course. Oh 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:18.259
 No problem for me to eat his hat. I will just dissolve the acid and neutralize it using the face 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:26.700
 Why bother people Why bother people okay, just as I feel sleepy like hell 

00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:34.019
 Lmao I thought I put on work shoes came out of the house like a curse 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.129
 My feet are as cool as hell of course, of course 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:45.569
 Whoever does not put his shoes outside and does not notice him on both feet, of course, of course it happens 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:52.499
 My high school had such a large number of ames when I had 

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.539
 Break the MCR. They announced this through the Palestinian Authority 

00:06:58.210 --> 00:07:00.210
 Extra display 

00:07:00.460 --> 00:07:07.799
 Counseling that day, what about whether this is true, you are all a bunch of boys. What about that? 

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.970
 Is this a good subreddit? 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:15.330
 I was in Dunkin Donuts and asked for three donuts and a full water cup of staff 

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:20.609
 Thought I said three donuts in a glass of water. Here's a result you can not make this 

00:07:21.850 --> 00:07:27.090
 Yes, you can stop lying. I'm sick of your lies. This did not happen 

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:33.659
 Do you say she says you threw those cakes? Put these cakes in water? No one else stops her 

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:40.559
 Get some help and a professor of gender studies told me to go to the subway and take a picture of 

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:46.440
 A male worker makes me sandwich as an extra label 

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.030
 patriarchy 

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:54.900
 It's funny that the gender studies certificate only qualifies you to work on the subway 

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.360
 There is no shame in making this evening at the gym man 

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:10.379
 It looks like something goes bull asking me when I told him that I was a lesbian going 

00:08:10.380 --> 00:08:14.820
 Oh, baby, you know my sister and I work together a lot 

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.400
 She will be here tomorrow at the same time 

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:24.479
 Like the door only the wings of me the God of Lesbos. We have found a bull image 

00:08:24.480 --> 00:08:29.700
 This is what actually seemed to have happened. What a wonderful story 

00:08:29.770 --> 00:08:33.270
 That's why I hate stories, and I hate telling them about it 

00:08:33.419 --> 00:08:38.069
 I can not believe myself until I tell a story and I do not believe others suddenly. 

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.589
 Yes really. 

00:08:41.589 --> 00:08:43.940
 I hope you will have a great Thanksgiving 

00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:50.940
 In fact, I do not find it fun to celebrate genocide and colonialism. So I spent this 

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.340
 Thanksgiving Blogging 

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:57.960
 Protest, but thank you. how was yours? The row applauds only ... 

00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.160
 They just clap ... 

00:09:00.340 --> 00:09:00.840
 finally. * Applause * 

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:02.840
 Someone said that. 

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.640
 Someone said that. Thanks. 

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:10.140
 In fact, I was a professor. It was amazing, and then it did a bounce. 

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.460
 I left a six-figure job at NASA 

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.700
 There are no responsibilities working cook 

00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:24.480
 McDonald's. Do not kidding the happiest I've ever been. Is your name Kevin Spacey? 

00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:28.260
 Do you live in the American beauty world? Is this what happened? 

00:09:28.260 --> 00:09:31.709
 Have you made steaks from the movies and applied them to something special? 

00:09:31.709 --> 00:09:37.439
 Is this it? Pathetic. Not even McDonald's wants you, okay? Despite that at McDonald's, we employ players. 

00:09:37.510 --> 00:09:39.899
 Check out the new Mersch. Link in description. 

00:09:39.899 --> 00:09:47.489
 I bought a plane ticket online and went to the flooded airport and got an inbound plane and now I'm in Sweden 

00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:52.859
 My drunken state of mind is affected, help. This is true indeed. That was me. 

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:56.519
 I used to go home to see my father and get confused. 

00:09:57.490 --> 00:10:03.539
 This actually happened completely. I feel that the reason why these jobs appear frequently over the Internet is the reason 

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:07.589
 Face to face, you know I can tell when people are lying. I'm very good at it. 

00:10:07.589 --> 00:10:12.179
 I think most people can tell when someone is lying. Do not really want to face people face to face. 

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.709
 It does not necessarily have to be easier for you to move on to "Wow, what a wonderful story" instead of going ... 

00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:18.699
 I do not think this has happened. 

00:10:18.699 --> 00:10:24.329
 Unless someone I know very closely, if my little neighbor is talking to me, tell me a story 

00:10:24.329 --> 00:10:26.549
 I'm not just going to call them like "yes, no". 

00:10:27.279 --> 00:10:28.870
 "You are full of sh * t." 

00:10:28.870 --> 00:10:35.669
 I think that's why people on Facebook often publish anything, because they're used to keeping away from these lies. 

00:10:35.670 --> 00:10:40.199
 So, it's an interesting phenomenon. What do you think, group? Let me know in the comments. 

00:10:40.199 --> 00:10:45.449
 Tell me a story that definitely happened to you. I'll be very interested to hear that. Thanks for watching this video. 

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:52.050
 Leave like if you enjoyed check out March Men. I really appreciate the support so far it was amazing 

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:54.050
 This was a pity pie. Good-bye.
