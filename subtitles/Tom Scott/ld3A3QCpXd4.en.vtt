00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.650
 If you watch this video, say this sentence: 

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:10.259
 No, really, speak it out. Because the way you say it 

00:00:10.259 --> 00:00:12.419
 says a lot about how you talk. 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:16.340
 Jonathan Ross is a talk show host and TV presenter in England. 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.310
 He is among other things known for his speech defect. He can not handle the / r / 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.970
 pronounce. According to most people, he uses the / w / instead. This running gag 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.400
 goes so far that even his Twitternaam is @wossy. 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.340
 That speech defect has a long history. Elmer Fudd has him too - he goes "wabbit hunting". 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.590
 If you want to portray a character weakly or lethargically, then such a defect comes in handy. 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.970
 "Wove, twue wove," as the pwester of Pwincess Bwide said. 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.480
 Here is a test. Speak the sentence again. I will 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.750
 this time covering my mouth so you do not get hints. Pay attention to the movement 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.230
 of your mouth during the R-sounds. Okay, now together: 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.220
 Make that / r / sound. Wait. 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.910
 There are two ways to do this. Way one: as a / l /, with your tongue 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.940
 against your palate. If you do a-la, a-ra, a-la, a-ra and it feels almost the same 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.260
 then you pronounce it this way. 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.430
 The other way is like a V, / w /, with your upper teeth at 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.049
 your lower lip. If a-va, a-ra, a-va, a-ra feel almost the same, you pronounce it like this. 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.700
 If you do it the second way: congratulations. You have the same "speech impediment" 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.680
 as Jonathan Ross. And the same as me and quite a lot 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.010
 young people. There are areas in Britain where people with the "lack" now 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.400
 the majority are, especially among people under 30. As with Invasion of the Body Snatchers 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.590
 the change happens quickly, without most people being aware of it. 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.850
 This is because a normal person, and even a connoisseur, does not hear the difference. 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.310
 I asked myself when I was little wonder why I could never roll my R - this is because the / r: / is very different 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:53.680
 than the R I use. If you wonder why speakers of some languages ​​the / r / 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.100
 and the / l / mix up - like Japanese and Polynesians - it is because they make the difference 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.670
 between the two do not hear. It is only logical if you / r / if you / l / sounds. 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.319
 The only way you can hear the difference, at least in my statement, is that I am too much 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:14.260
 breath at the PR and BR. Bright, bring brother. A puff of air escapes at "brother" when 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:21.260
 my mouth makes a bilabial stop, / b /, followed by my R: a labiodental approximant. 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.170
 Laboratory language because the lips and teeth are used, and approximant because they are close together 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.770
 but do not touch each other. It is not W - that is a labial-velar approximant, where the lips 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.700
 close to each other and the tongue against the back of the mouth. 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.180
 This is the phonetic symbol of the labiodental approximant. Phoneticists are using it 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.810
 him more and more during the vew languages. 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.690
 If you ask me, it is not even a speech impediment anymore. It's just 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.690
 a different way of speaking. Jonathan Woss was the forerunner of his time. Which do you use? 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.820
