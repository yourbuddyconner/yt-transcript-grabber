00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.140
 This is "Technical Difficulties" we play Quote is missing. 

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.940
 Together with me today - he reads books you already know - is Chris Joel! 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.380
 Benefit to the home team! 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.600
 All Favorite Gery Brannan: Gary Brannan! 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.880
 Does this dining chair have a catapult seat, and if so, how? 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.220
 and the softest man on the internet, Matt Gray! 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:12.860
 Hi Youtube! 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.000
 In front of me I have an article from Wikipedia and the others can't see it 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.660
 Every fact they get right is a point and a clock sound is heard 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.320
 and there is a special price for a really good answer that is ... 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.460
 Today we are talking about Graham Island. 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.280
 Due to the national shortage of oats in the 1980s when everyone emigrated. 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.580
 Is that what we in this country would call Digestive Cookie Island? 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.760
 Oat cookies! 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.580
 Thank you, one for you boys on the other side of the water. 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.120
 Ahh, is that what an oat cake is? 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.120
 Yes, it is digestive. 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:42.880
 I did not know. 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.360
 It is so much digestive. 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.940
 Are they not just called "English cookies" in Europe because they refuse to accept that they have-- 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.940
 They have nothing to do with your digestion at all. 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.720
 It is only here in England that we hold onto this false statement. 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:58.580
 It's a bit the same as they call it "la cor anglais" and not an English horn. 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.080
 [French accent] oh, they insane Englishmen 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.560
 They think everything is about them! 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.480
 all they say is l * rt over there 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.240
 Your cookie? L * rt. Your horn? L * rt. 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.280
 Less than two minutes into the show, in the series 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.320
 and the nation today, we humiliate France 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.320
 Hi France! 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.300
 We need a loop wheel with an arrow that says [click sound] bing! 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.200
 France! 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.060
 Just at all, except the one who says 'Germany'. 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.740
 We will probably reach you 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.500
 At some point. 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.280
 Wildly enough, the Germans said to France in '39! 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.200
 F * ck Morocco 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:38.300
 We haven't made it yet 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.900
 I spread a little love (!) 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.100
 Listen to this. eritrea 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.400
 We have you 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.520
 Graham Island 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.600
 OK 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.120
 Is it a man or an island? 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.980
 It is a real island 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.500
 There are a few Graham islands by the way, it's not, uhh - 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.400
 There is a Graham Island of British Columbia, Canada - So the New World - named after someone. 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.180
 It's somewhere in Europe 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.600
 It is not made of ... what are islands usually made of: 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:04.580
 Do you know what - So land? 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.560
 So that's, no no no, it's not made of land or stone or brick or anything. 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.720
 - Is it like one of those things that is an oil platform? - Wait a minute, "or brick?" 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.120
 No, an island is not made of bricks, Gary! 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.460
 You did it or so good, 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.520
 .. until you .. 'I give him a point' arhh it's made of brick ... No! 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.100
 Is it a volcano that is about to happen? 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.840
 I'll give you a point and I'll give you a cookie for it. 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.520
 because it's right on. 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.400
 It is a sunken volcanic island 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.660
 So it's not? - But it's not an island if it's not over the sea, it is 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.000
 As in 1831, came across the water for a while 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.560
 - Long enough to be seen - And then it was slammed. 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.240
 Yes. 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.560
 So this volcano had a temporary erection 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.060
 As someone jumped up, a flag stuck in and it sank under the sea. 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.440
 I think that's what would happen if it were Poseidon's penis 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.180
 As it sounds like it is 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.860
 You get the flag and it says pfft and the whole collapses. 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:01.740
 Cold water. 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:03.660
 Yes it gets much bigger when - 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.660
 When El Niño comes because if you understand! 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.300
 It breaks out once in a while - 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.620
 I'm sure it does ... 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:16.700
 In 1831, the Royal Navy flagship declared it to the British Crown 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.480
 Where is the island though? 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.400
 The island is out of Sicily 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.100
 But that's one of ours? 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.540
 It's ... Well .. 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.540
 It was ours in 1841! 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.920
 Pardon.. 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:27.480
 31st 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.520
 Nevertheless... 

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.940
 Come on in July / August 1931, disappeared in ..? 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.940
 - October, 1831 - 1850s, after Krakatau came up. 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.400
 Changing the sea level and all that. 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.060
 It is a wonderful theory, but I was going to the cheap joke: 1832 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.300
 So. The new island pops up, the English put a flag in it, 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.880
 Automatically a Starbucks on it. 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.980
 Automatic. Of course. 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:51.340
 Sorry: But Starbucks, from the time, of course 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:52.660
 Starbucks (!) 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.860
 How big was that island? 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:56.640
 About the size of a Starbucks. 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.220
 No, a lot bigger actually 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.820
 To Starbucks. 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.080
 Two Starbucks, a McDonalds and a parking lot for nudists. 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.280
 Points you can get one for it. 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.200
 It also had two small lakes. 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.860
 Two lakes? It's not a lake! It's just water that was caught when the island came out of the sea! 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.040
 Yes, do you know another defination of a lake? 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.180
 I'd rather ... It's just a damn puddle! 

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.100
 Again... 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.540
 Why did Graham Island disappear so fast? 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.560
 It sank? 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:30.000
 The oceans rose because of global warming, and the ice caps and all that. 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.980
 Not so early ... 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:43.780
 That's because it was magmatic or continental plate lava, instead of oceanic plate lava, which is very basaltic and hard? 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:50.520
 Continental plate lava tends to dry out as much softer stones, so it was eroded much faster. 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.600
 You are absolutely right, it was composed of very loose volcanic eruptions and - 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:00.640
 Simply disappeared into the sea due to rapid erosion through wave activity. 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.080
 -- Pardon; It is wild work. - Sorry boys ... 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.260
 Take the points. Take all the points 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:08.240
 This one is mine 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:10.960
 Put a fork in it here it is finished. 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.860
 And it eroded before anyone could figure out who actually owned it. 

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:17.740
 But we had a flag! 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:20.060
 Excuse Eddie. 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.640
 But Her Majesty's flag had been firmly planted and someone had opened a lovely bistro and a restaurant! 

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:30.080
 I like the idea of ​​Her Majesty's flag, not the flag of the Union. just 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:32.880
 "This is my ... F ****** f *** off" 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.620
 I'm glad you've read the official rules to take and declare a new country that is 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.720
 one of you dress up as Queen Victoria and say, "F ****** f *** off" 

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.600
 Even if it is not England, still dress up as Queen Victoria. 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:48.740
 "I don't enjoy this ..." 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:50.800
 France! 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.280
 Here's another one for you! 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.640
 Let's talk about that conflict then. Who else thought they had sovereignty over it? 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.020
 Italy! 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.640
 But ... did Italy exist at this time? 

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:03.420
 There it was ... 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.860
 Sicilians, potentially 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.140
 It's a point. Yes. 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.460
 Kingdom of both Sicilies 

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:11.720
 Where is the other one? 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.460
 In the quiet Mediterranean, they thought there was another Sicily below. 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.520
 They spent years making tunnels! 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.320
 The two Sicilies were the island of Sicily and ... what else? 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.040
 The bottom of Italy 

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:25.560
 Yes, you get one point. Completely right. 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.120
 The bottom half of what we now call Italy 

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.740
 The part they have succeeded in invading, indeed. Let's be honest. 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:30.380
 Yes. 

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.220
 So was Italy before, just the upper part? 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.500
 The whole of Europe was just temporary states for-- 

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.500
 That is why they are only loose federal states. As you know, Switzerland is still a loose federation of states. 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:39.080
 Yes. 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.120
 Of course, the best part is the Hellenic Republic. 

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.380
 It was all taken over beautifully. 

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:50.180
 That's what I thought! I went to Bern for something and on top of the big state building ... 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.180
 Is that the name of a place instead of the flaming, burning ..? 

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:52.900
 Bern is a place 

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.260
 It will be called Bern, because in Swiss, Bern means Bjørn. 

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.500
 And they still have bears 

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:00.160
 in a bear cage 

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.160
 Fantastic tourist attraction 

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.560
 We've caught them all, now they're here 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.260
 Been to Vauxhall? Just asking. 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:06.780
 In a cage! 

00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:11.580
 But, of course, the state building just says, and I didn't know at the time when it was: Helvetica. 

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.660
 And my first thought was, I looked at it and said, No, it's not. 

00:07:17.820 --> 00:07:19.420
 It's New Roman! 

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:23.680
 So you have the states and other states have a statement on it? 

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:25.400
 If it is in the middle of the Mediterranean 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.900
 You probably have one of the Mediterranean states close by 

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:31.100
 England and Sicily ... Spain also said-- 

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.940
 I can do that. Anyone who was close to the Mediterranean: 

00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.820
 England. 

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:35.340
 We are on the map. 

00:07:35.340 --> 00:07:36.400
 That's mine, it's mine 

00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:37.960
 Wait: Gibraltar 

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.540
 CF, claiming in Gibraltar. We are totally close that (!) 

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.380
 "I think you find that means we own this now." 

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:44.600
 "We own the port therefore we own--" 

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:47.660
 "What is it? What is it? You can get there? Try it!" 

00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:49.860
 You now have massive battles 

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:56.220
 with, really amazing petty, but oh my God still quite *** scary fight between Spain and the uk than gibraltar 

00:07:56.220 --> 00:08:01.340
 Basically: not only just moving towards a shipping vessel, trained weapons on it. 

00:08:01.940 --> 00:08:04.500
 Like in that kind of "no, we don't have fun 

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.300
 "If you don't turn around this one goes out 

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:12.280
 "and Bob here has got an itchy finger. He hasn't had a chance to use one of these for real ..." 

00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:15.640
 "He hasn't shot this since 1982 and he's tired." 

00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:19.400
 "And we all want to see fireworks!" 

00:08:19.740 --> 00:08:21.100
 "Turn around, fister." 

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.940
 What I have learned today is that I know nothing about Europe's history. 

00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.920
 Do you know anything about the Bourbon House? 

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:30.060
 Is that the one in Milan? I'm probably wrong. 

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:30.880
 France. 

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:31.820
 Point. [Bond] 

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:32.540
 Well said. 

00:08:32.640 --> 00:08:34.560
 How wrong can I be all? 

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:39.120
 European royal family of French origin. What did they want to put on this lump of volcanic rock? 

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:40.440
 Distillery, if it's bourbon. 

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:40.940
 Fort! 

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:41.660
 Hospital! 

00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:42.580
 A palace. 

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:43.540
 Leper colony. 

00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.520
 You are all thinking way ... 

00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.560
 BUTLINS! 

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.520
 Point! [Bond] 

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:53.360
 I really didn't want to say it was a Butlin's. Billy Butlin wasn't really coming and making this concept yet. 

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.040
 [French accent] Biilly Butliin. 

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:58.160
 But it is a resort. 

00:08:58.160 --> 00:08:59.100
 Is what we have here. 

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:02.680
 Of course Sicily had another name for the island. 

00:09:02.680 --> 00:09:03.520
 Barry. 

00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.720
 Barry Island. 

00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:06.480
 It is actually an island. Aww! 

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.400
 Oh yeah! 

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.020
 Was it like "Giovanni"? 

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.740
 Yes, it was Giovanni's. 

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:12.460
 Too early. 

00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:13.100
 Guiseppi. 

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:16.580
 They named it after their king, so it would be called, Ferdinandea. 

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.200
 Still marked on charts, for many, many years. Kind of stayed about eight feet below sea level. 

00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:22.720
 For a long, long time. 

00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:25.120
 What happened in 1987? 

00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.440
 It was blown into the air on purpose, so it was less of a danger to shipping? 

00:09:28.780 --> 00:09:30.780
 Yes. I'm going to give you a point to be ... 

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:31.440
 Yeah! 

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.120
 To be blown up in the air! [Bond] 

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.360
 blown up by accident? 

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.700
 Are, for "s *** s and giggles"? 

00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.120
 blown up by mother nature? 

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:40.340
 I'm going to give Gary [ding] that point by accident. What were they actually trying ... 

00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:42.140
 I can't believe I actually still say the word exploded. 

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.740
 What did - what were they actually trying to blow up in the air? 

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:52.120
 This was done, from the air, with a depth bomb, in 1987. 

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:53.400
 Did they fish? 

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.000
 Not with a deep bomb! 

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.900
 They can't be the depth bomb of a bloody submarine. It's an act of war. 

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.780
 Point! [Bond] 

00:09:58.780 --> 00:10:01.820
 Not in the Libyan conflict or something was it? 

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.400
 Libya had submarines? 

00:10:06.400 --> 00:10:12.880
 In 1987, a US Air Force pilot, on a mission to bomb Libya, confused the island for an enemy submarine. 

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:15.040
 And threw depth bombs on it. 

00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:20.520
 In how many seconds would it have taken him to go, "They got submarines? No Pft, we will leave it at that time." 

00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:26.440
 But also ... no, no, no. If he was going to bomb Libya and he had deep bombs ... 

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.160
 They must have had submarines, or why should he have been carrying deep bombs? 

00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:32.340
 Otherwise he would have hit it with a conventional bomb. 

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.860
 It's a reasonable point. I can't dispute the logic there. 

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.380
 So there is ... 

00:10:35.380 --> 00:10:36.700
 Isn't it a very wet country? 

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:37.200
 No. 

00:10:37.380 --> 00:10:41.880
 I have had a look while you guys talked about that on the referrals and the references on it. 

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.680
 Was it necessary? 

00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:48.180
 There is a bit of a dispute about this. It has been removed from the article a few times to go ... 

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.340
 "It's definitely a youth story." 

00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:54.060
 But there is a reference in "the Independent" to it. There is a reference in various other news sources. 

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.700
 All of them just say "it happened". 

00:10:56.700 --> 00:11:02.340
 And I wonder if it is actually true or whether there are some local legends that are made by the newspapers 

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:04.500
 Everyone has been referred to each other. 

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:05.000
 Yes. 

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.560
 That's why it doesn't make sense. 

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.340
 Yes. There is a small chance he dropped a conventional bomb. 

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.920
 Or a massive chance, I think as you say ... 

00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:13.860
 Yes, it wasn't actually happening. 

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.980
 The Independent says the Sun reported today ... The Sun says Daily Mirror reported today ... 

00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:20.420
 The Daily Mirror went. Yes okay, is ... 

00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:23.340
 What happened today. Someone blew a rock in the air. Fantastic. 

00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.200
 Fernando he said he is no more. 

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.800
 And from what we know. The depth of this particular thing would be eight meters. 

00:11:28.800 --> 00:11:29.840
 Yes 

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.920
 You do not need to spend a depth of eight meters. 

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.340
 No! Otherwise I would pull a gun and start shooting. 

00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.940
 You throw bottles on it. 

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:38.780
 Where did you go? 

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.740
 If you could depth blow up eight feet, you wouldn't have a boat anymore. 

00:11:41.740 --> 00:11:44.320
 You can send people your finger at eight meters. 

00:11:44.780 --> 00:11:49.060
 Top Gun. Just go fly upside down, over the top of it. Flip the bird on the way down. 

00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.920
 You can make reference now! 

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:54.740
 I saw Top Gun last night for the first time in my life. 

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:59.640
 I saw a movie today! 

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:00.320
 God. 

00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:03.760
 What happened in 2000? 

00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.020
 Someone put all those pieces back together. 

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:07.900
 I say it was un-bombed. Went out again. 

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:11.980
 Oh! I'll give you that point for that. It was close to outbreaks. 

00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:13.900
 There was seismic activity. 

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:14.540
 (Groans) 

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:15.620
 # I'm on the verge ... 

00:12:15.620 --> 00:12:17.060
 It wasn't quite there. 

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.000
 So what did Italy do? 

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:22.720
 Because of course it's not Sicily anymore, it's the nation of Italy. What did they do ... 

00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:23.680
 Surrendered! 

00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.460
 Italy. 

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.220
 Italy. 

00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:32.320
 Went and parked next to it, with a flag hanging over the side of the boat, ready to go ... 

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.280
 Ooh. A little bit longer than that. 

00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.280
 What? In fact stood on what it was ... 

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:37.960
 Yes, basically. Have one point. [Bond] 

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:40.840
 In fact, yeah, since it's going to be, erm ... 

00:12:40.840 --> 00:12:42.520
 Yes, it will be an exclusion, isn't it? 

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:46.200
 So the actual bubbling material is at the bottom. Just push up the dried column. 

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.200
 Dried! Cooled column. 

00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:50.760
 Did they cap it so it was over the ground and then demanding it? 

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:55.640
 Chris, out of all, was closest. They sent a diver down and put a flag under the water on it. 

00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.120
 So then as when it turned out ... 

00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.200
 Italy. I respect it. It's pretty cool 

00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:06.120
 As a Scrapheap challenge both come around the corner of the Mediterranean 

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.120
 Just an Italian, just waving. 

00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:09.400
 [frustrated cry] 

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:10.200
 Right. erm, 

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:11.480
 Ah, at what point. 

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:14.880
 can we get funds for this? Because it is just such a glorious disclosure. 

00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:18.240
 As the flag goes out. Just as it gets above. 

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:23.120
 Just as they are about to start playing, there really is Uppy down the Italian hymn that they've got. 

00:13:23.480 --> 00:13:24.960
 Out there comes Union Jack. 

00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:27.480
 [Cheering] 

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:29.800
 The Italian man just flakes off. 

00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.080
 Sean Connery nods and runs away in his DB5 shaped boat. 

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:41.360
 No, if Connery did, just like Union Jack came out, another ... a Scottish flag. 

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.240
 St. Andrew's Cross. 

00:13:44.240 --> 00:13:46.600
 See what they should have done is just laser cut it to the rock. 

00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:47.520
 Hmmmm. 

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:48.120
 Argue with it! 

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:51.200
 But! Erosion was a problem already. 

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.280
 As we have previously established. 

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:55.400
 He's right you know it. 

00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.280
 There have been foreign things because they have all the bases in the Pacific, they do not, it is man-made islands. 

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.640
 They could just sail in there, put some signs around it. 

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:06.000
 Pump the water out and start throwing concrete on this bastard until it is actually large enough. 

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:10.280
 Compared to regenerated items in Japan ... 

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:11.200
 Make a Dubai on it. 

00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.040
 Yeah! 

00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.880
 Do it in the shape of my face. 

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.680
 Has like a nose shaped volcano in the middle of it. 

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:21.120
 Well there is that in Dubai, there is no where there is that guy cutting his name into channels. 

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.760
 Doesn't he? That you can see from the room. 

00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:23.840
 And then turned it over. 

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:25.680
 They are no longer there. 

00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:30.320
 They are cut in and somehow they got ... not paved but regenerated. 

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:33.320
 Because there is not much water out there, let's face it 

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:36.360
 If the island rises again, it's almost certainly going to be within ... 

00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.000
 "The island will rise again!" 

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:39.720
 Thanks. 

00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:45.880
 If the island ... appears over the waves again, because of modern treaties ... 

00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:47.720
 Who wants rights to it now? 

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.060
 Is it in international waters? 

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.100
 No, not anymore. 

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:51.460
 - It's in territorial waters? -- Yes. 

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.740
 - Is it Italian territorial waters? -- Like that. 

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:54.600
 - It's Italy's. - Point. [Ding]. Simple as that. 

00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:58.220
 "It's just a small island. We're not going to have a big fight over it." 

00:14:58.220 --> 00:15:01.060
 These are words that will be spotted on a piece of paper within the next five years. 

00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.820
 So they said "That's yours"? 

00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.880
 I think you could choose to interpret it as so. 

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:07.200
 Ooh, so it's like when it first? 

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:08.400
 For scrapheap! 

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:11.520
 At the end of the show, congratulations Chris. 

00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:13.940
 You win this week. I think pretty clear 

00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:16.080
 Well I think Brannan offered a fight in the end. 

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:16.880
 It was close, it was close. 

00:15:16.880 --> 00:15:17.740
 (It is my.) 

00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:19.800
 Congratulations, you win a patch on the Somerset marsh, 

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:21.240
 that has been filled with fatty fish, 

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:24.900
 previously owned by a documentary maker and a white rapper. 

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:25.620
 Oh God. 

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:26.300
 Jesus. 

00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:27.600
 Continue. Come on. 

00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:30.060
 It is Michael Moore and Macklemore's mackerel moss. 

00:15:31.760 --> 00:15:33.600
 You enjoy your time on it. 

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.780
 Thanks to Chris Joel. 

00:15:35.780 --> 00:15:36.560
 Woohoo! 

00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:37.520
 Gary Brannan. 

00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:38.480
 Matt Gray. 

00:15:38.480 --> 00:15:38.980
 Goodbye! 

00:15:38.980 --> 00:15:40.840
 I've been Tom Scott, we'll see you next time. 

00:15:42.340 --> 00:15:44.800
