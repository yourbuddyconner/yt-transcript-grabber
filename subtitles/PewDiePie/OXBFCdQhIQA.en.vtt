 Drake (singer) broke a record when he broadcast for Fort Knight 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.520
 Fort Knight broke a historic record for the most watched game in a month

 200 thousand views against 20,000 views 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.520

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.540
 They are paid to play Fort Knight 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.520
 They are paid to do it 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.040
 YouTube Gaming whole Fort Knight 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.240

 The whole Fort Knight 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:31.040

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.540
 Hello, how are you guys? 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.700
 I'm here, Biomedic 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:36.800
 It's Biodebay 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.340
 I am here to talk about my favorite game my whole life 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:41.240
 Fortnite clearly Fortnite 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.340
 I love this game 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.920
 Very enjoyable 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.420
 Do you know what I'm looking for in a game? 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.660
 No no do not go away 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.960
 That's right I prefer theft games. 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.300
 Oh sorry! 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:58.980
 I meant theft game 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.980
 Now this is what the original content called! 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:02.980
 Fortnite has become everywhere recently 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.000
 I think I am the only person. I am the only person who has not played this game 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.000
 So today I think we're going to play this game please do not 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.740
 Wow, it looks like we will win the game 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.480
 I just have to make my son Dahir this maddor around this game 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.620
 * Many explosions * 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.320
 * Burping * 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.300
 Where is the other player? 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.300
 Oh there it is! 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.440
 I do not know if I can do this 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.340
 * Sound of heroic fire * 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.820
 Oh, I've done it (no) 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.800
 Yes I did (you did not) 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.700
 Oh, how much is exhilarating, (this is certainly not a mockery) 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.400
 * Cut YouTube clip * 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.400
 Oh, I'm sorry I did not sleep on me 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.800
 Play the game 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.700
 Wait, I have to play this game and not 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.580
 Is the interaction of the footage pre-recorded for someone? 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.900
 Instead we will interact to group 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.780
 Lokia fortune game Fortnite 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.760
 I prefer everyone so oh 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.920
 I have to do this 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.460
 I'll just joking 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.760
 I will not play Fortnite 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.120
 What. Do you think I'm a pathetic man? 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.260
 Is that true? 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.920
 Instead we will laugh at people who play Fortnite game 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:06.860
 We start with my favorite person. 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:07.820
 Fortinite Channel 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:08.640
 * Ali-Ay * 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:09.800
 This is a capital. 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.540
 At their best 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.040
 Get down to this 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:12.720
 My God 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
 All sections about Fortnite game 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.500
 *Laugh* 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.700
 is not it? 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:18.200
 There are lots of stocks and there is plenty of Fortnite game 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.180
 You should appreciate it 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.700
 My friend 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.380
 I specifically love this passage 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:24.900
 You are learning a regular clip here 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.700
 With interesting content 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.060
 200,000 views 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.740
 Next to him on the right side "the worst tour of Fortnite (funny). 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.560
 5 million views 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.780
 I think the main thing you learned about this is color. 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.080
 There are a lot of radiant colors here 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.280
 Because I feel if I take one of the 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:43.640
 My usual thumbnails are scrap 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.580
 You need a lot of gradient 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.860
 Oh to see this 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.960
 Here you look now much better 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.760
 I think this is how I will do my thumbnails from now on. 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.920
 We have to bring children to watch it. This is the way to do it 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.880
 You just increase the color gradient / color saturation 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.480
 You get kids' views 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.320
 What is the second thing? 

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.980
 That's true 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.640
 Provided that you have to bite the kids in the right place 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.240
 They will not watch a clip length of 10 minutes, 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.200
 If there are no bites in the section 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.340
 So you should get something 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.620
 T / to say the least 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.820
 Happens, and just fill in the foreground 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.820
 * Yooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo * 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:17.780
 Three, two, one, shot 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:21.440
 * Interesting optional song * 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.540
 I love you 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.960
 Get down to this 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.480
 If you want to know what is there 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.480
 Watch the full 10-minute clip 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.420
 It's very epic 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.820
 These rules apply to all YouTube 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.380
 But I think, I think that Ali - I do it as wonderful as I can 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.840
 These people are trying to steal my secret place 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:43.600
 I do not think this is a youth 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.240
 * Lots of interesting songs * 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.380
 What will he do? 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.300
 * Lots of dancing * 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.800
 Hey 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.800
 I had to watch 45 minutes to find out 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.520
 This not only includes ali-i 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.720
 This formula literally applies to every UTube that broadcasts or plays this game 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:07.100
 My God 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.760
 What was he doing? 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.240
 Well we are on the top 10 list 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.500
 *Shooting* 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.240
 My God 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.780
 How did you kill him? 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.260
 Wu and seven players are still alive 

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.100
 * Play music * Baghdad? 

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.780
 Brad and Saif 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.340
 Why do not I have such a dull and wonderful introduction as the rest of the great Fortnite Uyutubers 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.900
 Make one now please 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.600
 Or I will be very angry 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.800
 Where is the other person? Oh ha ha 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.660
 Or I do not know I could do this 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.780
 * Introduction to the legendary epic Genha Baghdad * 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:42.520
 He was melancholy 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.060
 Wow how wonderful they were 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.060
 Ali has the best introductions 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.060
 These are the places where I have lost my life 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.060
 This is really something crazy 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:56.580
 Oh God, the third one 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.360
 I have not tried this all my life 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.980
 No one ever did that 

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:35.320
 Reeyeye 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.520
 no no no 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.540
 I want more 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:06:59.220
 Come on 

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.520
