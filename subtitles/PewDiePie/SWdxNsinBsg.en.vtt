 Biodebee enters his secret tank 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.620
 Welcome back to Louis 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.100
 I love it 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.660
 Display 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.700
 Where I gave my Republican a wonderful opportunity .. 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.920
 From giving me free content. welcome! 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.746
 That's right! They all applauded 

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:30.560
 Boy boy 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.120
 Do we get some Mim from last week. Have you made your mimes? 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.920
 they 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.780
 Do not worry I will wait 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.320
 In the meantime, did I tell you about this chair? 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.960
 This chair is for only $ 399 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.960
 It has head support, back support, you do not see it but there 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.800
 He's really strong. Okay? If you are too fat 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.400
 Such as Kim Starr 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.480
 You will still be able to sit on it 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.900
 If we sold a hundred more of these, I would start to earn a lot of property 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.360
 Therefore, I would be grateful if we could at least sell a hundred more of them. 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.980
 You know, we launched this and we were like "hey" that's so cool, you know? 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.980
 The chair looks stunning, but 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.640
 $ 399 This is a high price, do people actually buy this? 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.760
 And no. They did not 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.760
 Even the mimes 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.000

 Best Friend Goals. Okay 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.780
 This would actually be true if you answer my calls, Jack. Call you late at night to tell you my feelings 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.520
 All I hear is the loud sigh and the healing 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.860
 what happened ? 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.580
 I have seen this bloody mem about five 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.600

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.840

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.771
 The mimes are very strange these days, man 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.320
 I do not even know how deep you can go 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.250

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.380

 Does he bite? Not but it can hurt you in other ways 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.700

 Got it ... I got it well thank you 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.720
 Why do not they make bulletproof vests ... "I've seen this one." if it was 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:44.119
 The hardest metal? "The reason it's so heavy ... One gram of diamond weight is something like 15 grams 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.488
 One gram weighs something like 15 grams 

00:02:47.488 --> 00:02:48.800
 I mean that's true 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.020
 Diamonds are heavier 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:56.000
 So weigh more .. Think about how much will be the weight of the suit 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.740
 More * Jumping out of fear * All the time 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.080

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.540
 A bunch of homeopaths is what you are 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.860
 A man who does not leave his closet, you are not afraid 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.960
 Disgusting 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.780
 I thought we were better than that on this channel. I thought we were ahead 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.160
 Your mouth 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.160

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:58.460
 (Cough and laughter) I can not show it 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:07.200
 The best of the misfortune curse of God on that hiding from a serial killer ... I: Oh God I will die if the killer found me: 👏👏 I: View Mim Haha 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:14.980
 A good man in Biodebay went to Japan and was not filmed dead .. But this is a false article 

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:17.440
 Why do not I get the credit you deserve 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.900
 A good guy in Biodebe Nobody talks about chemistry can be fun in Sweden 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.860

 Where is the Italian skin? What is back support? What do not you care about your back now ?? 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.880
 You can not put a price on your back what you can do 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.070
 Hey, how about this 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.759

 I'm not okay with stealing art I'm against you strongly 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:51.659
 Haha 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:59.329
 Mimat is not an art .. Take your head out of your ass, O boy, plus you steal mimes. I know. I know you do 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:04.068
 I forgot to carry the milk of the FBI agent: look outside 

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:12.439
 Very beautiful . He protects his marriage, but most importantly he brings milk 

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:23.840
 Son: My father why my sister is named Unicorn Father: Your mother wants to call her after something that does not exist 

00:06:24.509 --> 00:06:28.098
 Son: It seems logically thanks Father Father: No problem 

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:35.899
 Video about biodepay die ok If you're new to the channel you will not understand this prank that it's based mainly on real life 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:43.009
 The fact that I have never played video games because I am a professional player in fact I never made mistakes in ... 

00:06:43.009 --> 00:06:45.378
 My whole life has never been wrong in any way 

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:49.579
 Movements of governance or anything comes naturally easy 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:55.400
 If you see a body in a wooden chair, think about it. You know what it might take 

00:06:55.469 --> 00:06:57.469
 Sylvie and it will be but 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:59.930
 Anything more would just be disgusting 

00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.229
 So I come forward and will not end up signaling any breakdowns 

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:08.389
 And when I get very angry at the g bar on the bridge I think about myself. Hey 

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:11.658
 Do not let your depths dark 

00:07:15.419 --> 00:07:17.419
 I'm sorry 

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:20.000
 I worked forever to make a order for biodepay 

00:07:20.669 --> 00:07:25.489
 Absolutely awesome I'm sorry .. Is this stool under my nose 

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:27.629

00:07:35.279 --> 00:07:36.349

00:07:36.349 --> 00:07:40.249
 How sad is the length of this video ... Brad 9 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:46.729
 Biodebay: Hey, you're very rude. I do not have more mimes to show on Biodebay 

00:07:47.279 --> 00:07:49.369
 Brad visits the tomb of Biodebay 

00:07:50.219 --> 00:07:52.219
 Seconds after 10 minutes 

00:07:52.469 --> 00:07:58.129
 Leave an impression if you cry Leave the admiration now If I cried I know you are crying or at least press F 

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:03.469
 Although it seems that there is one hour of Luoy because it has a lot of new stuff 

00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:06.380
 Oh 

00:08:07.450 --> 00:08:13.830
 Please Ok I can barely get ten minutes what do you think ten minutes in the video ten minutes long because I 

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:14.410
 lazy 

00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:17.010
 Because I do not want to put more effort than required 

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:25.890
 No, not at all because there is not enough content for an hour worth listening to ... oh my god now 

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.499
 It is an attractive burger, king, lettuce foot 

00:08:29.170 --> 00:08:34.830
 It's not funny that does not make fun of his voice I've got an autistic burger king 

00:08:35.229 --> 00:08:37.829
 Lettuce foot, do not make fun of his voice please 

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:43.319
 Burger King lettuce foot I do not mock I'm scared 

00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:45.990
 Are you supposed to be scary? 

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.640
 Well what the hell this is 

00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:22.469
 Review all names and categorizations of all the amazing 

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:27.030

00:10:21.430 --> 00:10:22.270
 Bass 

00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:27.449
 I thought you'd fool me to say something out there. I love seeing people smiling in their phones in public places 

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:31.439
 Have they received happy news is the text of a loved one perhaps 

00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:38.159
 What can instill this joy at that moment is that Biodepi's return is true 

00:10:38.770 --> 00:10:41.639
 Come here, let me clear your tears. Sorry 

00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:45.570
 Let me clear 

00:10:47.050 --> 00:10:52.890
 Let me wipe them away. You're right. Do not cry. Do not cry 

00:10:54.520 --> 00:11:00.539
 You see if the floor is not flat Why can a biodebe chair do this but not this 

00:11:04.100 --> 00:11:06.100
 Because that would be anomaly 

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:12.249
 Vote if you want Brad to collect odd jump biddype attempts 

00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:16.419
 Strange attempts to enter the treasury and jump from them 

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:19.180
