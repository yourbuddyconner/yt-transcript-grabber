00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.690
- I'm taking January off, and while I'm gone,
some amazing creators

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.210
are going to be taking over this channel.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.300
We start with Rohin Francis,
a cardiologist who runs Medlife Crisis.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.536
His video includes footage
from his diving trip to Borneo

00:00:11.536 --> 00:00:15.430
and a couple of jokes that I
am deeply uncomfortable with.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.777
Rohin, over to you.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.460
- How long can you hold your breath?

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.450
One, two minutes?

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:28.120
I'm sorry, homo sapiens
are just pretty pathetic

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.060
next to the diving world champions

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.030
who can stay underwater
for one or two hours.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.470
So how do they do it?

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.880
Well, there are a few different ways,

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.700
some you can actually take advantage of
by channelling your inner dolphin.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:40.510
[dolphin squeak]

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.120
Others involve a little bit of gentle evolution,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.880
so maybe a bit of a tall order
for most of us

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.623
unless you're a member of an Asian community
who have evolved into real life Aquamen.

00:00:52.561 --> 00:00:55.311
[tranquil music]

00:01:01.453 --> 00:01:03.990
There are five ways we can
spend longer underwater.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:06.830
Number one is to increase your
tolerance to carbon dioxide.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.680
The first thing that makes
you want to take a breath

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.190
is the rising level of carbon
dioxide or hypercapnia.

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.450
"Hyper from the Greek,
meaning too much or above,

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.550
"and kapnos, meaning smoke."

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.660
This acidic waste gas builds up,

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.940
and the body is so acutely sensitive to any changes in
pH,

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.180
even though it's tiny,
that it starts screaming at you to...

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.040
Breathe, god damn you!

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.280
Incidentally, this is why any diet claiming
to alkalinize your blood is basically

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.220
[cow moo]

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.700
Now you can improve your carbon dioxide
tolerance quite quickly.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.510
I was able to go from about
90 seconds breath-hold

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.200
to five minutes with just a
few days' worth of snorkelling

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.223
and some tips from an
experienced free diver.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:49.770
The next obstacle though is
a lot harder to get around

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.090
and that's hypoxia or low oxygen.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.290
Hypoxia kills cells.

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:55.710
No matter how you die,
ultimately it's hypoxia

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.120
at the cellular level, i.e.
your cells being starved of oxygen,

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.600
that is the cause
of your inevitable death.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.660
Unlike training your body to
become more tolerant to hypercapnia,

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.020
increasing your tolerance
to hypoxia takes years of training.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.820
And of course, there is a level past
which no human can actually go.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:15.170
So what is the solution for a longer dive?

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.510
Well, to maximise oxygen delivery
and minimise oxygen use.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.010
Which brings me to number two.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.980
The reason that this steak
is red is a protein called myoglobin,

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:30.600
which is found in the muscles
of pretty much every mammal

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.420
and it's responsible
for storing oxygen.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.910
However if we were tucking
into a steak that came from

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.790
a seal it would be almost
black in appearance because

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.410
they've got ten times more
myoglobin than humans or cows.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.470
This is not a human steak.

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:47.690
So why can't we just
pack in more myoglobin

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.450
and store more oxygen like the seals do?

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.600
The problem with proteins is that

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.460
[child burbles]

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.780
The problem with proteins is that
when they g--

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:54.600
[child burbles]

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.500
The problem with proteins is th--

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.500
[child drums]

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.560
The problem with proteins
is when they get too tightly

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:03.200
packed they start to clump
together and lose their function

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.463
but marine mammals have evolved
a very clever way to deal with this.

00:03:06.463 --> 00:03:11.000
Their variant of the myoglobin molecule
has a positive electric charge.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.320
As I'm sure you know,
positive repels positive

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:16.020
and as a result the proteins
can get very close together

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.023
without forming those clumps.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.690
Number three is to adjust your
blood flow to preferentially supply

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.720
the heart and the brain at the expense
of things like the extremities

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.620
which are much more tolerant
to having a reduced blood flow.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:33.230
And number four is to
slow your heart down.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.680
Your heart is very oxygen-hungry organ

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.840
so by reducing your heart
rate you're immediately

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.770
buying yourself more time under water.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:44.040
I've mentioned these two together
because they form part of the dive reflex.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.620
Erroneously sometimes called
the mammalian dive reflex.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.720
It's actually been found in pretty much
every air-breathing vertebrate

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:50.910
that's been studied.

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.180
It's stimulated by submersion in water,

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.370
particularly cold water.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:57.680
And remember, below 200m depth,
water is cold

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.260
no matter where you are
in the world

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.630
and of course that's where most
mammals do their hunting.

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:04.060
So what is the dive reflex?

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.341
Well let's take a look.

00:04:05.341 --> 00:04:07.341
[bells]

00:04:07.341 --> 00:04:09.341
[blows conch shell]

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.980
That's the wrong video.

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.070
I've not tried this before
but I filled up a basin with ice water.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:24.080
I'm going to hold my
breath and submerge my face

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.880
in the water probably just
for about thirty seconds or so

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.410
and I'll see if anything
happens to my heart rate.

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.620
I've got a pulse oximeter
that you can see.

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.860
Okay. Here goes.

00:04:49.663 --> 00:04:51.460
Agh. That was cold.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:54.143
So my heart rate has dropped
right down to 45.

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.280
It's still staying at 45.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.220
I don't know how long I was under

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.600
maybe 30, 40 seconds.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.010
Now you can see it's slowly
starting to climb again.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.250
This is just a cheap Â£10
oximeter that I bought online

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.790
so I don't know how low
the heart rate goes.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:13.030
I don't know when it starts
becoming inaccurate but a lot of

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:16.320
these commercial devices will
have a cut off in the forties

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:18.907
because most people's heart
rate doesn't go that low.

00:05:18.907 --> 00:05:22.060
But I think it was a
pretty clear demonstration.

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.050
In diving mammals this
is far more pronounced

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.920
with Weddell's seals, for example,
dropping the heart rate

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.620
as low as four beats a minute.

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.215
This effect is mediated by
my favourite nerve, the vagus.

00:05:32.215 --> 00:05:34.515
Don't tell me you don't
have a favourite nerve.

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.490
Number five is also part
of the dive reflex because

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.470
it has another feature and
that's to squeeze your spleen.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.210
The spleen is normally a small organ

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.580
which is involved with the immune system
and filtering the blood

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.460
as such stores
a little reservoir of blood.

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:55.500
Now, in a healthy human
with a normal sized spleen,

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.440
that volume will be around 160ml of blood
or 5% extra oxygen carrying ability,

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.420
which can be squeezed out
as part of the dive reflex when needed.

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.540
However, diving mammals can
have significantly enlarged spleens

00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:12.540
representing a much
bigger reservoir of blood

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.780
to be provided when necessary.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.280
I'm sorry, it looks like this one's out of
reach for most of us.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.920
But that doesn't mean that
there aren't any members

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:23.800
of our species that
haven't taken advantage.

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:27.200
However, to meet them, we're
going to need to take a short trip

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.363
to Southeast Asia.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.140
Years ago I saw a BBC documentary
that stuck in my mind permanently,

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.880
which was about a fisherman who was so
negatively buoyant

00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:44.780
he essentially sank twenty metres and
walked along the bottom of the seabed,

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:49.170
and what's more, he almost effortlessly
held his breath for several minutes.

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.610
He was member of the Bajau community,
who are an ethnic group

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:58.475
indigenous to oceanic Southeast Asia,
the Philippines, Indonesia and here.

00:06:58.475 --> 00:07:01.090
I'm in north Borneo at the moment,

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:04.700
in Sabah where they're one
of the biggest ethnic groups

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.390
and my diving instructors
here tell legendary stories of Bajau

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.240
who can hold their breath for fifteen
minutes at a time under water.

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.740
So what makes them so special?

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.500
The Bajau have led a nomadic
subsistence lifestyle

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:20.740
for at least a thousand years,
literally living out at sea,

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.090
eating what they catch and
rarely setting foot on land.

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:26.570
Earlier this year, a research
team led out of Copenhagen

00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:29.880
published an incredible
study which demonstrated that

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.050
the Bajau have evolved
larger than average spleens

00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:36.650
when compared to nearby
non-diving communities.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.460
Free divers develop big
spleens through training.

00:07:39.460 --> 00:07:42.300
But the enlarged spleens in
the Bajau are seen in members

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:44.820
of the community who don't
do any fishing or diving

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.420
so we know that this is
a genetic adaptation.

00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:49.560
You might wonder how a
genetic pressure has been exerted

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.880
until you consider the fact
that the Bajau who dive

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:55.728
spend five hours under water per day.

00:07:55.728 --> 00:07:58.900
So you can easily imagine
how any mutation to confer an

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.630
increased diving ability would
have been positively selected.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:05.420
They identified many genetic
variations seen in the Bajau

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.350
but two snappily titled genes stood out.

00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:11.870
PDE10A is a gene noted to have
differences amongst the Bajau,

00:08:11.870 --> 00:08:14.540
specifically the part of
the gene that is responsible

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:17.340
for thyroid function and spleen size.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.280
And the BDKRB2 gene is involved
in the blood redistribution part

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:24.360
of the dive reflex that
we talked about earlier.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:27.290
Rather like the Sherpa in the
high altitude Himalaya, this is

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.620
evidence of human evolution
from our fairly recent past.

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:34.000
And now we're in the era of
genetic analysis becoming commonplace,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.480
we're able to trace specific mutations

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.120
and how they've travelled
through time and geographically

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:41.640
to make us the people we are today.

00:08:41.640 --> 00:08:45.940
But does research like this actually
benefit patients here in hospital?

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.480
Well I see the effects of
hypoxia secondary to disease

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:52.420
on a daily basis, where it
causes death and disability.

00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.470
The hope is that by understanding
how the Bajau or the Sherpa

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:59.120
have adapted to life in a low
oxygen environment, might guide

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:02.543
development of new treatments
to help the critically ill.

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.240
Honey I've, uh, thought of a name.

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.370
Just hear me out here.

00:09:08.370 --> 00:09:11.000
What do you think of Tom Scott Francis?

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:12.180
Ow!

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.860
- [clears throat] Thanks, Rohin.
Go subscribe to Medlife Crisis!

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.440
I would recommend starting
with his Minute Medicine video

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:20.730
on why you shouldn't run
every medical test even if you can.

00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:22.853
Next week, a maths puzzle for you.
