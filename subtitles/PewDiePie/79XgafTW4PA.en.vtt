 Pope means Putin Putin means Trump Trump means meatza Kim Jong Kim Jo means 

00:07:26.729 --> 00:07:34.519
 South, South Korea President of Korea means Obama means Obama means Conan meets Felix, my God

00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:24.470
 This was the hype since Ali-A used to introduce pewdiepies and decided to create a new one that could not steal ha ha got you a 

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:37.549
 This is very good * amazing * you need to start working on your own idea 

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.599
 Can we copy DreamWorks multiplication program after that 

00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:47.479
 This is very crazy to be honest 

00:08:48.450 --> 00:08:50.660
 I need to grow my beer a bit more boy 

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:56.599
 upvote If you want Brad to make the video and pewdiepie to edit it well I think I will edit the video that takes the effort 

00:08:56.910 --> 00:09:01.099
 Well, it will not happen, for example, your dear and your nine-year-old business 

00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:06.139
 The army realized that our leader was less 

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:13.880
 We are passionate and energetic and know and understand that marriage must be difficult and stressful and you must be 

00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:17.749
 Exhaustion When you are sad and drop hints about the stressful life we ​​care about 

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:24.530
 We see and we take days after two days of the week if that means you will feel that we love you better 

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:27.080
 This is very sweet * We really love you * 

00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:33.290
 Keep dropping these jokes at the end of the video where I would say I'm here tomorrow guys you do this every day 

00:09:33.470 --> 00:09:37.160
 I really appreciate their concern and I am really happy that I have an audience that 

00:09:38.490 --> 00:09:43.970
 I do not like the madness of me if they only notice something show empathy and appreciate it 

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.119
 It was the same thing when I made the jokes about 

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.830
 Running out of ideas I do not know if men remember that it was like a year ago everyone is still joking 

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:57.830
 I cry that I was running out of ideas and became a mem once I posted the video that looked like 

00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:06.799
 Barely inspired a little uninspiring Everyone kept going "I got out of my thoughts, my God!" He continued to get it 

00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:10.460
 Reinforced the fact that I ran out of ideas when it was reality 

00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.070
 Lots of ideas for Matrix videos as it was not a problem * We know it pewds * 

00:10:14.890 --> 00:10:21.239
 I kept this joke at the end of the video now where I say I'm here every day every day 

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:25.740
 Let me just make a joke because I do not pre-register the videos that I download 

00:10:25.810 --> 00:10:31.020
 As you see these videos, they are recorded either on the same day or the day before 

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:38.009
 Because it keeps them more fresh and entertaining this way I used to pre-register a day for example and a lot of YouTube users 

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:43.169
 I do it but the fact that I record every day I think is a kind of fun in a way that you know they keep 

00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:48.390
 Go and go on for a long time without stopping and I kind of just wanted to remind people 

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:49.959
 I'm here tomorrow 

00:10:49.959 --> 00:10:55.559
 check out tomorrow's video but then a lot of people i've seen a lot of people coming about this saying oh he looks really tired 

00:10:55.560 --> 00:11:03.539
 Or it seems like there is no active waiting is not right at all, if anything I do not really want to force him all 

00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.120
 Hey hey everyone 

00:11:06.430 --> 00:11:08.430
 If I do not feel it 

00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:14.370
 Sometimes I do not understand sometimes I really enjoy delaying the entire camera 

00:11:15.130 --> 00:11:21.089
 100% but often I just want to work more naturally and it is interesting how if you work more 

00:11:21.279 --> 00:11:28.588
 "Normal" is like there is something wrong with me or something like that but this answer is really long thank you guys 

00:11:30.130 --> 00:11:34.529
