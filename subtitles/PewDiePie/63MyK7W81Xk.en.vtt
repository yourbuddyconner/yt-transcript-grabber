00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
 One of the common questions you ask me is .. Felix 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.640
 How can you stay modest? 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.860
 I must say 

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.080
 To be the most successful alotiobers ever 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.800
 Get the most views 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.440
 Be that attractive, be this charismatic 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.340
 Being such a magnificence, being loved by all, 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:26.440
 It is not easy to stay humble (but) what I do is look at the humble people 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.880
 I appreciate their humility 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.160
 This inspires me and makes me more modest. 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.740
 I'm not just modest. But more modest than you think. 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.920
 Let us explore together examples of humble people we can follow in their humility 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.680
 Suffering to be very beautiful and stay true. 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.059
 This story is closer to the desired. I ... I'm very attractive. 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.060
 This causes pain. Not only pain, it is 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.440
 suffering. 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.460
 One woman admits courageously !! 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.880
 Amazing 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.640
 Sure, I feel .. I feel this. Okay, to click on the next video 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.479
 How? What is he doing here? 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.379
 It's The Times, Felix Schiller is one of the world's 100 most influential people, by Tracy Parker 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.380
 I do not believe this 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.979
 The news has appeared there. I do not want to boast but I do today despite my bad temper 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.200
 In good condition 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.640
 This is something typical of lots of Utopians 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:42.300
 That their ego reaches a point where they do not realize that they are not humble 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:49.320
 Certainly, the disgusting behavior of JacksFilms. To be honest, I do not expect less of him. I understand 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.160
 I'm not famous 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.980
 I've got over 2 billion views on the net and draw people's attention 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.120
 Every time I go out in public. Yup. That's true. They stopped calling me famous 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.140
 I can barely cross the doorstep without seeing the Piperazzi and meeting admirers 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.460
 Please set aside 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.950
 I'm a human 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.480
 Normal tries to walk beside you 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.300
 They stopped calling me famous because I am not. It will not change easily. The new pope is a humble man 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:26.140
 Just like me, which explains why I like it so much. 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.580
 I understand that the humble is attracted to another modest figure 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.400
 This is a scientific fact, if you are not humble, you can not understand this 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.190
 I'm not known as a humble person, but I wonder .. In fact I think I'm modest 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.640
 I think I am more modest than you understand 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.640
 Well, it's great in this section 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:59.420
 This is an example of a humble man. No one likes someone who prides himself constantly 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:20.520
 You see no one loves you boy, nobody cares about the number of subscribers you have 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:27.160
 Stop bragging to 450 subscribers. By the way, I mentioned that I have 62 million subscribers, what is this? 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.520
 The face of 2017. I forgot this page is open. Sorry guys, I've been 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.529
 I am looking for humble people and back 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.940
 This. 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.949
 It was not my intention. I'm on a picnic and the sexists continue to watch me. 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.940
 These boys stare at me 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.140
 Hate / Yen This is when you get especially from sex matchmakers? 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.020
 Worst of all. Is this my nature or after purchase 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.500
 Range Rover 2016 Make My New Hair Story 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:13.880
 very wonderful. A nice mixture of being modest about your hairstyle and your new car at the same time, very inspiring for the self 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.689
 It is still going on. I have been doing this recently since I was given a tip to people 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:24.540
 And gave money to displaced people. I literally see a saint here, guys 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.600
 What a humble character. Love is when your seven-year-old child falls 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:34.900
 The Woman of the Year award is on the shelf. Did you mention that I was a woman of the year? 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.120
 Award, by the way 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:42.580
 It is broken by the Fathmilh and telling him is okay because the work I did to get the prize 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:50.020
 It still exists in the world and I do not need a big bronze eagle with my name on it. People know who I am 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.020
 Thanks for such tweets, like this, when I have a drawer full of 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.680
 Messages from readers have changed their lives, 

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.240
 While it is more turbulent than me. What a poor man 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.520
 I am very happy that they gave the Woman of the Year award to such a modest character 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.940
 Do not like to boast or boast at least modestly. A homeless woman asked me to buy her water 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.560
 I did, buy two of the best brands 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:24.080
 Literally, saint, the best water brands for the homeless 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:31.380
 Do not you think this is a bit exaggerated? Do not you think that spending money with carelessness? When I left the mall 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:37.520
 Did you mention that I bought food from the mall? I asked her to choose the flask that she wanted 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:40.300
 Which water bottles do you want? 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.260
 I did this to remind myself 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:48.840
 No matter what situation we are in, we always have the option 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.120
 Modesty 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:51.760
 beautiful thing 

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.140
 just awesome 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.040
 That's what it's all about 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:01.140
 The second thing I wanted to address was the comments about being a rich boy 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:07.180
 I will talk to you directly, you guys are not the purpose .. Forget .. This is not the purpose of the channel 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.000
 You guys are watching the wrong channel if you think I'm a rich boy 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.140
 I try to tell you, I worked hard for what I got from my channel and I take this 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:19.540
 Pride and pleasure, the last thing is 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:31.240
 Very modest figures. I love how to produce YouTube for modest characters 

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.940
 It's a society full of people who do not want to show off too much 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:42.560
 It is not as if he is profiting from the channel and mentioning money through the title. Which creates 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.159
 System 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.909
 A beautiful ecological of modest personalities like me 

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:53.840
 I am very happy that I gave up my university degree to become Utopar 

00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:57.400
 is this me? 

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:04.760
 I do not know if you know this but I was studying management in Australia, it was required 

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:11.040
 It would give me a job with a high salary, and I was not happy and decided to do what I liked. 

00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.320
 I have never felt more alive 

00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:17.500
 I am very humble 

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.580
 Can not be lucky every day 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:29.000
 You should know that I donate a lot of money to these environmental groups 

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:31.080
 By the way did I tell you ... 

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.320
 A classic example of how humility is, things that are not interconnected 

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:44.920
 I get a chance to be modest. Very great, I see a repetitive pattern 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:47.400
 Sure, they can not communicate 

00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:53.120
 Sure, they told me that I was pretty. Sure, my clothes are wonderful 

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:57.340
 Sure, they told me that a technician could save the world 

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.980
 But does that mean anything? 

00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:08.240
 Do they see the struggles and victories of an artist and thinker behind closed doors? 

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.040
 Is anyone serious 

00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:17.540
 No more. I think the same thing all the time. Yes I have a strong attraction 

00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:25.620
 But is anyone serious? I also have high intelligence 

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:28.740
 Set here. Can anyone even see this? 

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:42.300
 The first rule of humility is to give the homeless while filming them, except that 

00:08:43.740 --> 00:08:45.100
 Who will know? 

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.560
 even with 

00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:52.480
 140 IQ, have you mentioned that my level in IQ 140? 

00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.940
 I can not install a printer even with 

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.240
 105 .. 

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.100
 a thousand 

00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:02.580
 IQ, I'm still stupid like you guys 

00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:10.780
 Although I am incredibly intelligent. I'm still stupid. AVG protects you from several dangers in recent times 

00:09:11.140 --> 00:09:13.380
 AVG software most 

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:16.880
 Modest at all 

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:43.980
 This is the national anthem of humble characters like me 

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:46.920
 And JP, my favorite part of the event 

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:50.320
 You have an interview after 10 minutes, I: 

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:55.680
 Sorry, I will sign and take pictures so I meet everyone 

00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.040
 We always have the option
