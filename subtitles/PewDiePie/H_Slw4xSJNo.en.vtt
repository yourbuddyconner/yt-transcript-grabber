00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.260
 Before you start this video you must tell you guys 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.500
 Something like that was going on behind the scenes for a while 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.199
 I did not really want to treat him just in the hope that it would go away 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.349
 But sometimes you just 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.859
 It's better to talk about it and hope things get better, but I've seen 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.710
 Jaxfields 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.860
 YIAY is better than LWIAY 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.800
 JaxFilmS copied my content for literally weeks 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.959
 I know it's a joke like ya ha ha ha I've stolen my content but I've increased it 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.209
 I'm tired of it 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.520
 So I wanted to show you, comrades, because you know that I am frank with you 

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:57.809
 what happened 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:00.989
 Well I made that offer 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:08.580
 It gave me time to review your requests. I asked you to edit these pictures now on Alfotoshob 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.189
 I'm going to review like a really real fun idea 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.180
 All I do is original ideas and I have many of those ideas 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:24.360
 I have really wonderful ideas and then quite a day after this guy 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.520
 Utopir hate becoming one of the best 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:35.280
 I have already sent some pictures to me and I carry a blank paper 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.309
 And I will leave you guys do what you like in the pictures, it is OK that they have only once 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.070
 I will not comment on this but then you do 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.070
 How to spot a squad fam 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.140
 This is true squad fam 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.360
 I'm starting to invite you guys 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.689
 It's like a fun new idea that I've created myself 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:57.260
 Then of course 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.600
 What happens to a squad fam fam squad? 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:01:59.400
 What's new? 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.700
 He has just made her move this is not funny 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.190
 Well it's only twice but do it right? 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.839
 I asked you to create a thumbnail of this video of course 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.060
 Later I asked you to make me a thumbnail of this video. 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.980
 How do you get those avacars, Jack? 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.120
 How did you get that idea? 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.490
 It really started bothering me for a long time and then it was so boring 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:34.029
 YIAY is better than LWIAY It's just that you've exceeded your limits 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:36.030
 And it is even 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:39.400
 Has the same presenter 

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:48.669
 And then dare to call me on his channel 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:54.490
 I had the integrity so far to keep this between us, and then it could cost me the video 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.020
 I'm trying to be a good guy here guys really 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.400
 I want you to stop copying Biodebe and his own LWIAY 

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:05.060
 By the way is my opinion presented by the new audiope? Let me see her in order 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.480
 Thank you Jack for the introduction 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.940
 Now let 's start the episode LWIAY - best show and do not add 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.540
 I'll add you with 6,000 lawyers I'm sending this season 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.880
 its war 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.880
 Last week I asked you to publish some good old jokes on Beydeepe Supredit today I will review these rules 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.020
 It's a games room in my house 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.180
 I have nothing to do with this 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.420
 It's just a joke but can you do it? Yes you can because it des 

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.480
 It closes 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:48.820
 next one 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.000
 I have $ 399 What can I do with it? BioDay wants to know your site 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.785
 Very nice joke 

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.540
 I'm surprised I've lived longer than I thought 

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.420
 Making a very good song 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.069
 Very cool I am happy 

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:48.549
 I'm glad it's very interesting to see that those old jokes will live all this long 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.780
 Some of the follower and some come back again and some come crawling from the excavation to them 

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.080
 O God, one another 

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:01.020
 It's another remix f 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.600
 This good is very good 

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:33.300
 He has defended but defended the most important is helping John to restore his own YouTube channel 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.790
 I would have forgotten 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:39.279
 Johnny This is the most sad and the most cruel thing and cruel 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.010
 I saw him right now 

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.489
 Johnny got a letter from someone who told him 

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:50.680
 I want to help you record a video 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.230
 It was so good that you got it right, you guys went to Johnny's Channel and cleared it 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.149
 No one really knows what happened then this new channel appeared and everybody was like 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:06.310
 Oh, is that it really is then explained here in the video, and that this is more sad 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.790
 I'm trying to do a real Johnny job 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.290
 And 

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:13.580
 everybody 

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:14.894
 It 's me real or not 

00:06:14.894 --> 00:06:16.899
 Basically Johnny is 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:22.449
 Karaoke on YouTube I made a video for him because I thought what he was doing was great 

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:23.870
 I wanted it 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.380
 I wanted to give him attention and you guys were so wonderful I saw you leave wonderful comments 

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:35.499
 He was very happy with that but it was a very nice thing but someone stole his channel 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.470
 I've cut it to let you know it has been scammed on me 

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:42.129
 Because I did not think there would be anyone with this evil 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.880
 I've been talking to YouTube and I'm trying to help him retrieve his channel again. I do not know why it takes so long 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:53.200
 I do not know what they're going to do to help him, but he did a 9-year video compilation 

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.429
 It has 9 years content which has just been wiped out and this is very difficult 

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:04.960
 But I feel a bit responsible because it would not have happened unless I made a video about Johnny 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.129
 Johnny has a sponsor and I will put him at the bottom of the description 

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:13.660
 He also has a new channel that I will put down below 

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.830
 Go and help the man abroad 

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:22.929
 He attacked but most importantly he helps John to get his YouTube channel back. I'll regret it though 

00:07:28.195 --> 00:07:29.979
 Mubarak 60 million Bio-Bay 

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:33.999
 You mostly did not see it, but I made it a week before I got to 60 million 

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.649
 Thank you for your new products 

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.280
 Come with a poster to make sure that I'm talking about the 50 million product 

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:49.280
 Check them in the link at the bottom of the description 

00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.300
 do you know 

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:54.580
 I'll only rate 1 of 10 because I'm in it 

00:08:00.620 --> 00:08:01.420
 I really hate ads 

00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:09.160
 I have many of them I do not get ads definitively What! How is this possible? I'm just watching Bio-Pi 

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:11.700
 Damn you do not understand â˜º 

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:26.140
 He is naked Edgar 

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:31.090
 Yes it is again 

00:08:31.729 --> 00:08:38.439
 It's a misunderstanding that they think I'm stealing ideas, but that's the opposite 

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.040
 Just check the history of the video you've done first 

00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:45.489
 It's not really fair 

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:51.700
 I try with every effort I come up with a new idea and all that I want is stealing it 

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.980
 I do not understand 

00:08:55.220 --> 00:08:59.980
 Do you know the way 

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:10.090
 Nice little joke you have done a good job you have more subscribers than Italy 

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.190
 Pathetic 

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.540
 Italy 

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.700
 Cheers on you 

00:09:15.900 --> 00:09:18.180
 Additional joke 

00:09:18.880 --> 00:09:24.400
 I almost do not know how long the video I am trying to help editors 

00:09:24.400 --> 00:09:27.669
 A little bit, but they did not make the video long enough for Felix 

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:36.969
 You can not afford $ 300 for the chair, and I have completely lost touch with the fact that this is not the case 

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.840
 Tsui estimated that ðŸ˜‰ 

00:10:11.760 --> 00:10:13.580
 Buy the dreaded chair ðŸ˜¶ 

00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:23.260
 Damn you right 

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.240
 Congratulations 60 million 

00:10:25.420 --> 00:10:31.200
 Thank you, but we could not do this without each other. Thank you guys so much for 60 million subscribers 

00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:33.809
 This really means a lot. I did not think we could do it 

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.859
 I know it looks like a joke or I try to be modest but 

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:41.969
 Frankly I thought the 50 million biggest ones would get it 

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.629
 So I really am really proud and I am really glad that you guys have been involved and 

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.300
 You know the 60 million club 

00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:54.150
 We get 70 million subscribers. Thank you guys for watching and leaving I'm really grateful to you
