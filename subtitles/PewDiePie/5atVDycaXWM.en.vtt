00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.820
 Remember when Vine was turned off 

00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.460
 Everyone is like... 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:08.100
 How could it affect me? 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.360
 So... look at these weeping viner 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.460
 so funny 

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.560
 Why do they have to rely on it? Do you know - 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.700
 If Youtube is dead, I will be the first to celebrate 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.020
 I have Moet champagne, Charles Diana Champagne in 1961 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.880
 Ready to celebrate 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.800
 Regardless of whether google pulls at any time...plug...press... 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.020
 It’s obvious how to express it casually. I can’t speak English. 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.060
 Twitter decided to turn off vine... 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.500
 But we really didn't think about the long-term impact, do you know? 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.100
 What is the long-term impact of Vine being turned off? 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.640
 let me tell you 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:48.980
 Hey! Everybody! 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:50.420
 Vine refugees... 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.940
 They... they are omnipresent 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.020
 They are scattered all over the net 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.500
 Some people ran to youtube, some people ran to Instagram 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.480
 Where they can continue to spread their 6-second film in new ways. 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:01.100
 Look! 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.440
 These funny and repetitive films I took 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.660
 There are sexual hints, and it’s really hard to laugh. 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.960
 Please accept me. 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.520
 Exhibit 1 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.760
 Paul Brothers 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.320
 We don’t need to say anything about them. 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.800
 I...we have... already 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.300
 Disaster has caused 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.080
 It’s Christmas 欸~ 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.960
 "God has abandoned us" 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.740
 My favorite vine refugee is definitely... 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.900
 Piques 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.280
 Piques...Piques... 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.540
 Piques is my buddy 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.100
 I love Piques 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.360
 Piques used to be an excellent vener and fled to Instagram 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.840
 If you ask me, this looks like the wrong decision 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.900
 I know that you can easily make a lot of money on Instagram. 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.500
 But at the same time it is not so good 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.360
 I didn't... I didn't see a lot of tag ads here. 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.020
 Piques him... 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.380
 What do you do on Instagram? 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:55.520
 Like... 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.580
 You are sitting in a car... 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.140
 With funny text, like... 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:03.540
 When she said "sit on my face" 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:11.620
 Or... 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.240
 I am blue, if I used to be green, I will die. 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.880
 Or... 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.700
 When you have a good car, but you are ugly 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.880
 Mark a ugly friend 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.620
 The best element of Pique's po is... 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.480
 Erotic elements 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.360
 Let you want to point in from the thumbnail 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.400
 baby? 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.700
 I want a new bag to give me some money? 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:42.380
 Like... many people just clicked on the positive girl on the thumbnail of the film. 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.180
 "正妹们" plus quotes... quotes... 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.940
 I have lost... I am going to have a stroke soon. 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:50.980
 I lost the language function of Jesus Christ... 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.880
 I will watch this video for... 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.700
 Is for...Piquet... 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.660
 Mane 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.820
 That is where the babies were born... 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.020
 Never!! 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.320
 I let you put it in my ass~ 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.800
 I will take the money quickly. 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.720
 he can not...? 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.120
 He can't go... 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.540
 Isn't it cheaper to find a prostitute? 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:20.920
 I know what you are thinking about. 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.580
 I want to know if there is a second bomb in this film. 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.720
 Don't worry, here are 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:26.900
 There is also a second bomb 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:29.760
 Baby? Give me some money, I want to buy new shoes. 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.320
 Don't be too!! 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.120
 I let you play this 喔~ 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.220
 I will take the money quickly. 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:47.060
 I do not... 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:50.940
 Just need... 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:53.500
 sit down... 

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.280
 (It’s a tumor...) 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.440
 Don't be too!! 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.140
 But I know what you are thinking about. 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.820
 I need to know what happens next. 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:06.340
 Is there a third bomb in this series? 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.380
 Of course 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:08.980
 Will you buy it for me? 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:12.540
 No... Don’t ask me anything more. 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:14.780
 I will let you put it in my ass again~ 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.540
 Take the money quickly!!!! Take the money!!!! 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:22.180
 Dry, I really want to die. 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.600
 I will take the money quickly. 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.780
 There are too many such movies, my days are almost just beginning. 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.880
 "When you step on the plug" 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.600
 Where is the smile?? 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.720
 Where is the smile?? 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:58.700
 Laugh at... 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.280
 Laugh at... 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.940
 Super will use...film thumbnail... 

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:06.820
 ...by the way 

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.380
 This can't be broadcast on Youtube so I have to do mosaic processing 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.260
 but... 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.480
 10/10 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.740
 Let’s see where the smile is. 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:25.340
 "Nude will kill people and not become a case" 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.140
 "I laugh too hard" 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:28.180
 me too 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.040
 Look at it, it’s the same smile. 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.520
 You know that I have a hand before... 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.420
 I used to have a gun... as a prop... 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.000
 It’s there... I’ll put the muzzle in my mouth. 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:53.620
 Then shoot myself 

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:59.120
 I can't do it anymore because as long as I do, the film will be cancelled. 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.920
 Now I hope I have a real gun. 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.040
 As I said a lot before... 

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.460
 ...Vine refugees ran to shoot vlog (vlog: image blog) 

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.400
 Just like you already know 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:13.440
 Take a look at one of the videos. 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.200
 Nothing, except... 

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.100
 Billing... Billing... and... 

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.160
 More bills 

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.560
 this is life 

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.460
 What is this? Twitch's Life Class (IRL) Live?? 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:43.420
 Let me put the lens here 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:46.380
 I just want to... 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:47.660
 I just want to... 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.840
 Don't look at it, you naughty ghosts~ 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:53.560
 Even if I fully accept the refugees 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:56.020
 I believe this is a very important point. 

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.540
 But this is really too much 

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.760
 Now many people are attacking my girl... 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:03.520
 Lele Pons 

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.700
 She was recently heavily criticized by the Youtube community. 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:09.980
 I don't understand... I don't understand why 

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.240
 why?? 

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.240
 why?? 

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.440
 Maybe you heard her 

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.440
 She is a viner. Her work is basically... 

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.940
 Just "banging on anything" 

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.420
 That is very interesting 

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.160
 Right? 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.160
 Will you return me? "When someone doesn't pay for a pencil or a ballpoint pen" 

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:22.940
 So my...? "When someone doesn't pay for a pencil or a ballpoint pen" 

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.440
 My pencil!!! 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.900
 She is an expert... 

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:30.220
 An expert who uses the body as a smile 

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.920
 "I expect the relationship with the boy vs reality" 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.020
 I like to watch people fall, it’s really funny. 

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:48.740
 "Which is your favorite Christmas movie?" 

00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.280
 But I am here to help Lele Pons 

00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:54.960
 The criticism she got was unjust 

00:07:55.140 --> 00:07:55.660
 Ok? 

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.040
 You don't know Lele Pons just like Lele Pons like me. 

00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:08.440
 People just taboo Lele Pons have appeared in YouTube rewind 

00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.320
 And you are not invited by YouTube rewind, so you are jealous. 

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:15.260
 "We invited two special guests" 

00:08:15.700 --> 00:08:17.980
 Then people say her face looks... 

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:20.560
 What happened to her face?! My God... 

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:21.840
 Then I said... 

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:29.080
 You don't know how good she is. 

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:33.000
 She really donated her hair to charity 

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:41.740
 Sorry... she donated her "send" to the charity. "Lele Pons was caught and donated" to the charity, causing anger." 

00:08:42.880 --> 00:08:45.320
 That... those hair extensions are expensive...so... 

00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:49.660
 It’s great that she can do this. 

00:08:50.040 --> 00:08:52.200
 Do you like being bullied? 

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.200
 Don't worry, Lele Pons is here to help. 

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.800
 This is the first film to appear if you search for "How not to be bullied" 

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:07.520
 People strongly criticize this film, but... 

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:09.880
 You don't understand... 

00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:13.160
 ...not knowing Lele Pons like Lele Pons like me? 

00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.740
 She not only does this vlog, she also directs... 

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:19.320
 She... she also edits the film 

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:21.160
 She also wrote the script... 

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:22.900
 She also starred in 

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.100
 That needs talent, ok? 

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:28.060
 In her... she is basically the next Tommy Wiseau (note: the director who issued the "Best Piece in History") 

00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.680
 Do you know what they said? 

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:31.000
 Hey!! Everyone! 

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.040
 ...all wrong, social studies are terrible!! (Note: American citizenship class) 

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:36.040
 Wait, let's not quarrel where the teacher is? 

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:40.440
 - My God... - She is beautiful. 

00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:43.160
 She wrote this line... 

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:46.060
 About herself, she wrote these... 

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.480
 She reminds me of the "room" (note: the worst piece in the history of Tommy just mentioned) 

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.620
 You know everyone in the "room"... (Note: it is the worst movie in the history of Tommy just mentioned) 

00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:51.740
 It is said that Lisa is very positive (note: the heroine of "room") 

00:09:54.340 --> 00:09:56.080
 Wow, it looks so sexy. 

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:56.840
 Lele Pons 

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:58.740
 I am not coming here to tell you that you will not be bullied tomorrow. 

00:09:58.740 --> 00:10:01.840
 You are all likely to be bullied, especially you, you are a fool of love. 

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.260
 I don't know if I will be bullied when I go to college because if I am bullied, everyone will... 

00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.440
 I can't understand any word he said. 

00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:11.000
 This short play is really good. 

00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.800
 Miss Pons, I just want to say that you are really positive. 

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.180
 do not talk 

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.500
 Again 

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:19.780
 Come again... she is... 

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:26.080
 Ok, let's see what I should write. 

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:28.400
 12-year-old child said that I am very beautiful 

00:10:29.440 --> 00:10:31.760
 Ok, great, then I will write again... 

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:34.200
 12-year-old child, once again, I am very beautiful. 

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:36.660
 That's right, everyone must know that I am very positive. 

00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:37.740
 I am Lele Pons. 

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.960
 However, the audience loves this taste. 

00:10:39.080 --> 00:10:41.620
 Hahaha, really cool...hahaha 

00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:43.740
 Jesus Governor, I guess... 

00:10:43.740 --> 00:10:45.960
 I guess I should start to shoot a short play. 

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.840
 Kidding 

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.440
 My views are more 

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:51.040
 Oh... there is a little turbulence 

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.020
 There is turbulent flow!!! 

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.840
 We are suffering from turbulence outside of expectations, please sit back in the seat. 

00:10:59.300 --> 00:11:01.380
 Have you seen a 5 minute movie and want to know... 

00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:02.900
 Where is this focus? 

00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:06.560
 Hey, are you talking about my movie? It’s funny. 

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:08.060
 They are all 10 minutes so shut up 

00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.840
 I have been looking for where the stem is. 

00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.440
 I do not... 

00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:11.520
 why...? 

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:14.560
 It doesn’t make me laugh at all. 

00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:17.120
 I was traumatized after I won the hunger game in Latin America. 

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:19.480
 And I know that you are the only one who can stop it. 

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:21.680
 Just like when you play in the US 

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.320
 So, do you want to join, Miss? 

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:27.620
 They call me Kenneth Evertine, not a white name. 

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:37.540
 Where is the smile? 

00:11:37.540 --> 00:11:40.380
 I have never come in so fast, I love you~ 

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:44.560
 To be fair, you know people... people obviously like these things. 

00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:46.820
 There are also good reasons, just like I just explained 

00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:50.540
 I am also very happy that people are entertained by these films. 

00:11:50.540 --> 00:11:52.780
 Because it should be so because these videos are great 

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:58.720
 To be honest, at least... even if it’s bad, it’s a cancer, but at least... 

00:11:59.460 --> 00:12:00.920
 It is original content... 

00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:03.620
 Except they all use the same stalk 

00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.080
 again and again 

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:10.080
 If you like this video, please remember to fund my Patreon. 

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.620
 It is in the information bar below 

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:13.880
 The smile is that I don't have Patreon. 

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.340
 But I am happy to create one 

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.760
 Translation, timeline: In order to understand what the fart child is saying, I am going to find someone who looks at the original lele cancer video...
