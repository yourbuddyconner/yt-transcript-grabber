00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 Every week, three ninjas are slain inadvertently on our roads. 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.060
 This can be avoided. 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.460
 I am Frederick Fahrvergnügen, President of the Royal Association 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:16.040
 For the Prevention of Accidents involving Nerves 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.940
 Or RSPAIN shortened. (tn: RSPAIN sounds like ass pain) 

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.400
 Did you know that in a recent study, 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.840
 has less than 1% of drivers claimed to have ever seen a ninja? 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.580
 It fits. (Have seen a ninja) (Never seen a ninja) (Said we should fuck off from their passenger seat) 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.840
 So, in the coming days, we will send these free luminescent headbands 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.780
 to dojoer throughout the country. 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.960
 If you combine one with a reflective vest, you can be sure to be overlooked. 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.740
 What else can you do to be a safe ninja in traffic? 

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.100
 Well, you should consider not wearing so much dark clothing. 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.020
 Barry here is a road safety ninja 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:48.220
 Haiijah! 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.920
 He has white and blue on, so you can see him at night. 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.560
 Why not buy one of our special flashing Ninja Lamps 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.520
 which can be attached to the belt? 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.980
 Along with our patent-pending Ninja AdSense alarm. 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.440
 [Beep] 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.380
 "Adversely, this ninja sneaks!" 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:06.100
 [Beep] 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.840
 And our new traffic safety signs. 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.400
 We hope to reduce the number of ninja disasters, 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.680
 or "disasters", to zero. 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.500
 I, Frederick Fahrvergnügen from RSPAIN 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.860
 say to you: Be a traffic jam this winter 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.040
 [bang] 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.040
 Ahhh! Ow ow ow. 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.040
 Off my leg! 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.400
 Ouch. Of it hurt! Aaaaaah! 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.700
 Oh, I think it's broken, off, hell in hell 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.580
 Call for an ambulance! Aaaav !! Aaaah! 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.580
