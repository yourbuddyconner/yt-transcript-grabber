00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:02.400
 Start - Hey, I am Matt. This is Tom. 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:04.569
 We are playing Jenga with a chess clock. 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:06.640
 Jenga with a chess clock is huge for Jenga. . . 

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.580
 How do you do it so fast? ! 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:11.750
 Compared to ordinary Jenga, Jenga with a chess clock is a huge improvement. 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.280
 If your timer runs out of time 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.180
 Or you dumped the tower 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.180
 You will lose. 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.060
 Now, I explain how it works for those who don't understand. 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.120
 It has two separate clocks 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.220
 You can only use your time in your turn. 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.890
 So at the moment... our remaining time is almost exactly the same. 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.380
 Because I have some difficult moves, 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.449
 Matt also has some difficult moves. 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:34.220
 But now his time is less than me..........40 seconds left 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:38.140
 But mine is not. So I have a little breathing time, 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.280
 Only a little time! 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.510
 But... this doesn't mean I will lose because I have to do difficult moves. 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:53.080
 The trouble is that Matt is very good at martyrdom. 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.840
 Having said that, Matt, you still lag behind me for 10 seconds. 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.250
 Oh...oh, sure enough, you got that. can. 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.370
 Can I get it? Can it.... Yes! Ok, I got it! 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.580
 So the rules are the same as ordinary Jenga, you can't take the squares from the top two floors. 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.300
 But let's get started......... 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.680
 But except that you can take it all. 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.280
 Matt, you still have ten seconds....... Oh, not good..... 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.860
 God, I almost lost. Oh, Tom, you still have 25 seconds... 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.340
 17 seconds. This is absolutely no problem for you. 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.520
 There are still 13 seconds, Matt. 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.250
 So what Tom needs to do is not to let the tower fall over. 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.320
 But my timer will run out quickly. 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.560
 Oh, but I need to find a square to move... 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.090
 Ah! AAAAH! 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.380
 You have 15 seconds left, Tom. 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.800
 Ok. I am fine. I am fine, I am fine, 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.090
 12 seconds, Matt. 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:46.610
 10 seconds left, Tom. 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.490
 Ah! This is very good, very good, very good, I am very good... 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.011
 Five...four... 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.080
 Fives! four! three! two! 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.140
 Ah, don't! 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.770
 This is Jenga with a chess clock. 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.649
 This is much better than the original. 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.940
