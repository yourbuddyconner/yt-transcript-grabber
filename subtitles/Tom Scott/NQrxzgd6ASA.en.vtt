00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
 This is Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgo-gerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch. 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.500
 The longest name in the UK. 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.320
 And I needed two weeks to teach it 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.740
 And that's what nursing words are doing; we learn long words 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.740
 because it's interesting 

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.760
 let's learn that, ok the longest word, technically, in English is about 100,000 characters long 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.680
 but that's the product name so it does not actually count 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.800
 We found that the longest word in the river pneumonoultramicroscopicsilicovolcanoconiosis. 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.120
 but this is not taken into account because it is a professional word. 

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.660
 So we learned that the longest was not the expert word in the river 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.660
 floccinaucinihilipilification. 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.460
 but it does not matter because that word is deliberately sketched 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.460
 with the intent to be a long word 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.340
 and it means "to be meaningless" 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.760
 what is really ironic. 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:43.480
 Deliberately. 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.680
 Then we learned that the longest non-technical, not deliberately worded in English 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.680
 "Antidisestablishmentarianism" 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.800
 but this is not used in everyday speech 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.800
 Language does not generally support, 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.800
 or English language is not supported 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.320
 dugi rijeci. 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.420
 Because they are uncomfortable, 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.500
 because they are unexplored, 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.500
 because they slow everyone down. 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.900
 We have cut the "internet" into the "net" of my people, 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.900
 because the three slogans are over. 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:07.980
 This is not the real name of the place 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:09.360
 No one calls this place like this 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.840
 it was a publicist Victorian era. 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.740
 Even years later, 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.360
 I recite this name to you 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.240
 because it is now a tourist attraction. 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.060
 The dense river is here because they are interesting, 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.060
 not because someone actually uses them. 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.600
 The longest word I use: "internationalization" 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.240
 what is the term in technology. 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.560
 Which is 20 letters too long, 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.240
 which is long enough to hack into the i18n 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.780
 when it is written. 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.140
 Actually, unattractive, 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.820
 it's not hard to say, it's not something to remember. 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.900
 But so does the language work 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.900
 if it is not practical, shrink it. 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.700
 It could not have come from any other 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.700
 but for publicity. 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.700
 Something you probably did not know. 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.920
