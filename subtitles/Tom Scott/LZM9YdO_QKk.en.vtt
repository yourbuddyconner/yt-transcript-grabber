00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.650
A few years ago, I got a message from an ex.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.350
And it said,
“roses are red, violets are blue,

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:07.310
“I've got chlamydia, and you might have too”.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.880
Which, first of all, is genius,

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.730
but it meant I was taking a trip down
to the clinic the next morning to get tested.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.380
I have a point to this story, and I swear
it's about computers.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.360
If you ever want to see a complete cross-section
of London life,

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.439
do join the queue for the STI testing clinic
first thing in the morning.

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.550
Actually, get yourself tested anyway, it's
the right thing to do.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.710
Anyway, I go to the clinic, I pee
in a sample tube, seal it up, hand it over,

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.080
and they give me a little business card with
a phone number and a passcode on it.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.260
And I can call that number the next day,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.570
and if my tests are all clear,
then the system will tell me.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.340
And if they’re not, it'll pass me over
to someone at the clinic,

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.090
because you do not deliver bad news
with an automated system.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.320
So the next day, I call the number,
type in the code, and the system says:

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.700
"Thanks. Here are your test results."

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.760
And then there is a pause.
A proper, ten second long pause.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.300
And as I stood there on my mobile
in the middle of the street,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.580
it felt a bit like that artificial pause that
they add in reality shows

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.980
before announcing the winner.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.100
It felt like there was a spotlight on me,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.900
all dramatic tension music playing in the
background.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.800
And then it says "We're putting you through to
one of our team.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.740
"Please stand by."

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.119
That's bad news, right?

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.420
Bad news comes from a human.
Why are they passing me through?

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.570
Someone picks up,
I give my passcode again and they say,

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.180
no, it's all clear, you don’t need to worry,
everything’s negative, you're fine.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.509
And I ask why the system put me through,
and they say,

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.800
"oh, no idea, it just does that sometimes".

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.860
It just does that sometimes.

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.890
Did the database lookup fail in the background,

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.390
and it dealt with the timeout by
just passing me to a human?

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:50.590
Was there a small note on my file somewhere
that confused it?

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.619
I've no idea, they had no idea,

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.330
because whoever wrote that code,
whoever designed that system,

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.009
the moment there was any error,

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.670
they just told it to go to
"we're putting you through"

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.609
without explaining why and without thinking
what that might cause.

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:09.130
That phone system is used by people asking
about things way more serious than chlamydia,

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.480
the sort of things you can't cure
with a course of antibiotics.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:16.160
And sure, on the scale of complaints
it is minor,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.510
but mistakes like that are a symptom of something
much bigger.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.040
I've talked about bodging things in the past.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.030
I encourage it for hobby projects.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.000
Just slapping something together as a proof of
concept, just so it works for you

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.819
is a great principle
when you're making a thing for yourself.

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.790
But if you're making something for the public,
for mass consumption,

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.780
particularly something that's going to be
used by people in very vulnerable moments,

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.580
then you've got to take a lot more care.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.290
Every time we build something for the public,
we have to start making the trade-off:

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.130
how much time and money is it worth to deal
with every edge case?

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.159
Maybe the designer thought that lookups would
only fail one in a million times,

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:58.180
and if that's the case, then yeah,

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.120
it's probably not reasonable to bother recording a whole extra message

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.880
and programming in a whole extra edge case.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.780
But if the lookup fails often enough that
the clinic receptionist just

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.840
dismisses it as normal... well,

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.460
by that point it's too late to make a change,
isn't it? The system's in place,

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.200
it'd be far too expensive to fix it now.
It'll do.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.690
The trouble is that we're often dealing with
unknown harms and unintended consequences.

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.480
Far too often a bodged-together system that
was just meant to be a test

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.220
gets rolled out into production, and
everyone just has to deal with the bugs

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.860
because that's all anyone can
afford to do.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.770
I will always bet on incompetence
rather than malice,

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.580
I will always bet on someone not thinking
about consequences

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:43.330
rather than thinking of them
and going “who cares”.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.370
We see this with big tech companies.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.410
Facebook allows the world to communicate in
unprecedented ways,

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.439
it does huge amounts of
emotional labour for us,

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.800
it allows people to keep in touch with
old friends that they'd just fall away from otherwise.

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.840
But it's also enabled stalkers and abusers
to reach people they shouldn't,

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:06.680
it’s allowed a huge amount of private data
to be misused without real consent,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:11.060
and it’s arguably helped cause terrifying
election meddling.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.340
Now, I don't believe anyone in Facebook's
management was

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.980
rubbing their hands in delight
at the chaos it was causing:

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.830
it was just a series of seemingly-reasonable
decisions that added up to huge consequences.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:26.420
And then there's YouTube: it allows anyone
to publish their experiences to the world,

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.080
it provides income for creative people that
bypasses traditional media,

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:34.890
and it’s helped people connect
with other people's lives.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.790
It's also helped to radicalise folks,

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.840
to promote conspiracy theories,
and to traumatise children.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.700
Are those tradeoffs worth it?

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.300
It depends on your moral framework,
and it depends -- let's be honest --

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.410
on how it's affected you personally.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:52.000
It's not like there's a crystal ball
that'll tell you, yes,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.160
your brand-new dating app you’re developing,

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.510
that will cause 1,000 couples
to marry and live happily ever after,

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.160
but it will also get three people murdered.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:04.410
The real world is not a trolley problem.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:08.310
The STI result system that I called
presumably reduced the workload on staff,

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.708
and it allowed people to check their results
out-of-hours

00:05:10.708 --> 00:05:13.390
when it was convenient and discreet
for them.

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:16.290
You'd hope something like that wouldn't have
a downside,

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.750
but then the designers screwed it up because
they thought it was good enough,

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.300
and it wasn't.

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.240
One extra check,
one extra voice message that said

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.400
"Sorry, I can't find your result,
just a moment" would have solved that.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.580
Every time we design a system, we have to
minimise the potential harm.

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.560
Look at the code that you write,
look at the systems you design, and think:

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.440
How could this be abused?
How could this fall apart?

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.340
What are the failure states here?

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.640
If you were a bad actor,
if you wanted to use this maliciously,

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:47.190
how would you go about it?

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.950
Think about how you’d attack your own systems,
explore those failure states,

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.420
deliberately screw things up
and see how your code copes.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:58.280
Because if you don't, someone else will.

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:00.580
Thank you very much to the
Centre for Computing History at Cambridge

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:02.700
who've let me film with all their old equipment,

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:05.100
and to all my proofreading team
who checked through my script.
