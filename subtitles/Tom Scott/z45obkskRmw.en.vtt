00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
 I am a Briton in Florida, which means I use a huge amount of sunscreen 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 to make sure that I do not become as red as a lobster. 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.360
 But here's something you might not know: the SPF factor on sunscreen, 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.000
 that 50 here, in this case - because I am very pale - was originally intended as a factor. 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.100
 The idea was ... if you burned without sunscreen in 10 minutes, 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.180
 then it would multiply that time by a factor of 50; you can endure it for 500 minutes in the burning sun 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.320
 before you would actually be burned. 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.380
 Well, the point is: that is not really true, because sunscreen is a lot more complicated than that; 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.140
 it requires differences depending on skin color, on all kinds of things, 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.340
 of your personal response. 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.980
 Unless the sunscreen is broad-spectrum, like this one, it does not defend you against the more damaging effects, 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.460
 the long-term effects, in addition to the occurrence of becoming red. 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.280
 So, how do they test it? 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.060
 Well, the way they do that is quite interesting. The FDA in the US 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:54.880
 in this case - the Food and Drug Administration - required 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.820
 an "in vivo" test. That means that the test must be done on a living volunteer, 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.260
 which probably means that someone has rubbed one arm with sunscreen 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:10.460
 and the other not, after which they are placed under a solar simulator until they burn to see what happens. 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.000
 And even though it can, technically, reach a factor of 100-200 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:20.560
 the FDA does not require more than 50. In Australia this is not even more than 30, 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.660
 because everything up there is considered confusing to people 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.820
 who think they can apply sunscreen and stay outside all day without risk of skin cancer. 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.880
 So, to summarize: Sun Protection Factor, especially a lot of nonsense, 

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.520
 but you still have to rub yourself because otherwise, 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.580
 Well, then you look like I'll probably see in a few hours. 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:41.500
 And that... 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.940
 ARGH! 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.820
 Oh yes, and do not let it come to your eyes! 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.180
 OH! Which... 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.460
