 I wonder how many Kobe Strike are getting on hmmMMm .. Continue the maze and you'll see it 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.120
 Sometimes take the syllables from Channel 4chan. But I guess I've seen every trailer from .You laugh.you lose 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.560
 Congratulations to me and everyone .. We are trying something different today

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.510
 Let's Begin

 While Pedala. He has a famous voice that can easily be identified as "AAA", he issues a "Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.760
 I'm laughing internally because of it 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:55.120
 It was close by. Wow it's a high standard level here. To see more clips. It seems that we have next "Harry Potter" 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.020
 What is that ? 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.240
 (We have updated our Privacy Policy) 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.680
 When was this video uploaded? What is that. The old beast is the ass 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.999
 = Old mim has been uploaded yesterday. Lord Cake, more fit ...... Lord and Oahik Ya Ahi. - Now concentrate 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.240
 On how to make you feel and allow your hand to drift into the cloth 

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:34.779
 I can not believe I did not play this game. Literally I've played every game of oh .. What is this David Craig? 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:41.520
 Werdlow? . Well, what will this be? "Minions"? " partner " ? 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.680
 (Mark Zuckerberg) 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.320
 HAH 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.320
 Oh my God ... 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.460
 Haha Well okay, maybe you made me laugh but this was not the "Skratta" I've been to 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:02.040
 next one ! Have you made "Skratta" after or not Leave an admiration if you did not do it Press the bell button for more interesting clips just like this section 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.750
 ... installed a new 18-foot neon sign along Route-66. You can not miss it 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:15.160
 Next to the Tower Theater, once it is turned on, the Deli-Cat-Essen label will be visible. 

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.420
 What? 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.560
 Delicatessen (food additives make it appetizing) 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.840
 This is - I think it was a Swedish word. You can not miss it 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:28.869
 It is next to the Tower Theater as soon as it runs on the sign you will clarify the Dale Cat Essen. 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:37.269
 (Wrap) I do not understand. Oxidation. I need to scroll down and see if anyone can explain this joke to me. I did not get it 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:45.638
 With a sense of glass breaking, all oppressed groups, especially the most oppressed, must flourish. Players (OH MA GAH) 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:53.619
 What is supposed to me to say? Are you supposed to say no? Players are not suppressed? Because that would be a lie 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.609
 There were no group, behind the players who were abused, 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.959
 For abuse. Just take a look at Battlefield 5, just look at Assassin's Creed 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.829
 How dare he put a woman in the game Assassin Creed, Assassin Creed, I know that women can not 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.960
 .. to run. Where will I go with this joke. This is a great question. Hey Grandi 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.440
 The best pirate I have ever seen. So it seems .... 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.920
 Not only the clear flex tape is strong adhesive 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.000
 Keep all the water out of the boat, 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:30.680
 It creates a strong and powerful barrier that seals the elements and can be seen through them 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:43.100
 Even in the most harsh conditions, the tape can wipe the floppy clean, and hold tightly! I think I'll need a bigger boat (Wahoo!) (Phil Swift tries to storm the stairs) 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.800
 Well done Grandayy you did it! (skratta) 

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.800
 did not expect that. You are a good bar, good bar. Gary needs massage 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.880
 You need to massage the testicle, with the baby oil and put it outside 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.880
 See him, see this man, is as follows: Oh yes (° ° ͜ʖ ° °) 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:06.200
 Put the penis warm position in the evening in warm, cold winter. This sounds like one of those interviews that are fake 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.980
 As you know, they edited it to make it inappropriate, but vice versa 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.980
 Make sure all the flow is black 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:12.980
 (Sounds strange necrosis ... or is it?) 

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:17.880
 Or perhaps it is. Category - Pets and Animals (Wait for what) Moving 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.960
 All I want is a black lotus. here we are 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.060
 Lotus Black? 

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.040
 Lotus black live on the current 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.300

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:34.420
 It's a LOTUS 2014 

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:47.940
 (Pewdiepie laughs while the guy dies inside) 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.680
 This is a stunning live on camera and I think it did not have much of the original magic of the pools. It always amazes me 

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.999
 How adults can remain interested in Pokemon cards. Pathetic. Played heavily, until completely destroyed 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.700
 Wait, Snake Sneak in the crush? Was it always? 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.840
 (Laughter) A library cop from Seinfeld. 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:29.680
 Wait, was racist in it? 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.960
 Oh hell yes. 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.220
 (E) My God, damn you 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.080
 The other video will pause temporarily. (Laugh) 

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:49.420
 108/5000 Great, what character of the alphabet will become the next man Mimi Put your bets in the description 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.960
 I'm thinking of Q Coz it's a bit weird is not it? 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.960
 Girl look how orange you (BLEEP) look 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:03.080
 (A faint laugh) God's curse! They're very fast you can not just go to Maui or whatever whatever matters 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:07.740
 You see what I mean? 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.140
 I need to address what I have just seen and now FIFA does not do so in front of Lord Cake 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.560
 Very disappointed in this compilation. So let's check it out live now 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:22.060
 All stars on flute h * ckin ') 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:28.720
 Sorry Dolan I already made this Mimi. Good-bye. How does life look during the menstrual cycle? 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.520
 What's up, darling? 

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.460
 (Laugh) 

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:39.840
 My beautiful lady I'll give you (laughs). Pass 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:45.700
 Yes, turn on the US. She had some girlfriends and it is best to launch a machine called the muffler with the sound of the carpet 

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.000
 Awwwww, everyone press F on your keyboard now 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:04.280

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.520
 They did it ... they did it because they did it 

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.140
 Is this new? 

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:37.570

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:41.800

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.949
 Well everyone. that was good 

00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:49.660
 Some skratta had a good moving though 

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:56.499
 Smoke Mimat every day. You know when you have those side straps, you know, it will not be that wonderful 

00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:00.939
 But I'm willing to take a give it a try. I'm willing to give it a good old try 

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:03.840
 I'm surprised and wow 

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:13.860

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:17.000

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:37.900
 Flexible sealing membranes they keep alive 

00:08:39.420 --> 00:08:44.000
 Fine some of them just fine. I am 28 years old 

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.590
 What is the joke there? Some are so bad that you destroy all credibility 

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.680
 Maybe I planted there to throw me from the next 

00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:00.020

00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:03.720

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:18.000
 Well, well, this is epic 

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:32.060

 This is the biggest insult ever 

00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:27.880

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.980
 Well, I hope you have enjoyed today

 Of course you did not thank! Many guys watch the video for another Skratta du 

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:43.400
 It leaves you like that if you lost and went out like if you were here 

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:49.820
 That would be great and maybe a comment. Jah! Good-bye. This is something new if you have not realized very well
