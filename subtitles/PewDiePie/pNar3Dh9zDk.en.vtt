00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.400
 I read book 72. Sorry, I am lying. 

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.350
 title. That's right. 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.460
 The book I read in 2018 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:14.120
 In my garage, this is all of mine. 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.870
 Know how 

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.140
 The death of the other party means a 28-year-old male 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.550
 Discovering a book is one thing. 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:25.010
 This is the end of the year, I want to make a sort 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:28.010
 Some of my favorite books to summarize and talk about that 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.890
 I have read this year. And I also want to make this book 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.860
 I hope to encourage you to read above. 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.740
 As well. Teen, with a percentage of fun 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.480
 In the lowest valley of history. 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.120
 Let us change this situation. Oh yeah. 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.610
 The reason why I started reading is 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.640
 Because I have done it before 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.520
 New Year's resolution, so I want to make sure that maybe because 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.670
 This may. You can take the same resolution. Maybe 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.490
 You have the same problem because I have this is 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.850
 I have a sort of problem 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.040
 s things. Sounds a little weird, but 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.740
 Generally as long as things get a bit 

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.710
 I will get bored when I am difficult, I will transfer to something else. 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.410
 Otherwise, this may be something that I like stupid. 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.370
 Play video games. If it’s boring at some 

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.160
 I really don't care about the end, I will buy a new one. 

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.980
 Game or transfer to something else or a hobby 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.170
 Once the project is as it gets a bit boring. 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.090
 I generally don't finish it like this. 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.500
 I miss that feeling, I sort out 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.380
 This is what I missed the gratifying feeling, although you 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.300
 Know that even if it's not the most interesting. 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.570
 I am still very happy with my experience. I am very happy 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.230
 I can move to the next thing. Preach 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.170
 In the case of instant incoming and NG, there has been no teaching 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.140
 So far, I think especially social media 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.990
 Ok, we should literally never end. 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.900
 Give it. This is just some of the constant going and going and going and 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.810
 go with. I want to feel like this, so I said my new 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.690
 The resolution of one year will be, no matter what I do, I am going 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.540
 Finish it. I didn't have any books I had thought of. 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.450
 It just got a bit of a coincidence, I decided 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:05.370
 OK, I will read a book, I am leaving, if I don't like it. 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.720
 I do not care. I just went to finish it. Finish it. and so 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.080
 I started with reading science fiction and want to be fair 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.020
 I really don't like that much. I am very happy with me. 

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.840
 Read it, I know what I want to read 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.690
 Different under. I really like this, they are just a bit 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.390
 Come, move and and be here for me 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:26.030
 Later, I was very happy. I am very happy that I did it. 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.470
 this decision. 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.170
 One of the main findings for me, this year is 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.870
 Found my favorite writer, I talked a lot about 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.540
 This channel is Yuki I Shima. 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.570
 I don't know the author of this matter, when I read him and me 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.540
 I think I really joined the effect, so I almost don't want to 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.240
 Talk about him because he found out as 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.060
 Equally interesting, almost still really join 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.880
 my experience. I pulled out of Twitter 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.640
 Ask if there are any suggestions from Japan 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.510
 Writers because I like to read more of their colleges 

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.400
 The air really counts too much. I think Yukio is a 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.980
 The name of the woman. I think this is a female writer because 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.150
 When I read that this elite fell out of favor, I can see that I just felt sewing 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.100
 Can be completely merged into the protagonist's mind 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:10.430
 This is the literature I have never really used before, even 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.250
 Although this character this little boy is very special 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.250
 Say I am the smallest. I am there, I 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.130
 It is to it, I think I have a window into 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:22.100
 Time, when writing cycles. with 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.130
 Is this why I am so 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.980
 Attracting his book of literary studies 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.650
 Learning Yukio’s discharge of men’s lives 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.140
 You definitely know more meaning 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.080
 Symbolic and motivating ideas 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.930
 His work makes it even more interesting. 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.030
 So, I think that's why for me, your mission people have 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.800
 This effect is still reading more about him this year. 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.560
 Non-fiction works such as Sun and Steel. 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.230
 This is his life, the way he wants him 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.990
 Reintroduced into the life of the samurai way 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.900
 Japan and many of his books reflect 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:59.660
 Move up ideas 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.540
 I went through Japan during the Meiji period. soon 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.510
 After the end of World War II, I hate to say this, but 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.240
 The point is that he wrote the sun and steel which is one 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.800
 Magazine, he is an avid lifter 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.820
 Weightlifting is not typical of me 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.910
 Guess the rider's hobby. 

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.520
 Because he thinks this is in the sun and steel 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.370
 He called the old warrior 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:25.160
 Flowers and swords. This is how it is simplified 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.380
 But basically this is his idea, 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.740
 Samurai should spend as much time 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.350
 Write poetry because they spend time 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.380
 Practice and disappear with your own sword 

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.290
 I feel like. Japan has forgotten them 

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:41.930
 Steel or Japanese sword. with 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.720
 Especially in the westernization of Japan. One 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:47.450
 A lot of work like a dislocated horse. 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.950
 It is technology at Wat Arun. They will 

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:54.950
 This reflects this shift. 

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.740
 He is also obsessed with the idea of ​​death. 

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.280
 Young, he is really dramatic size. with 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.260
 Mishima is supposed to win the Nobel Prize, he 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:06.230
 It should be one of the first winners. This becomes 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.110
 An article, I don't know why I don't mean that I am sorry, I am just. I 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.040
 I like to talk about male Schmidt. He is a poet. 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.960
 It's interesting. He should win Nobel 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.480
 Award, but what is his misunderstanding of character and 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.180
 Still quite young and received such an award. 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.180
 So he got snobbery. Then he went to a 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.030
 His peers. instead. with 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.690
 I think twice he should even win the Nobel Prize. it 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.570
 It is the kind of recovery. He is still young. we 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.510
 I really don't know who he is. So when he 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.390
 It may get the award when you get older. but 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:41.420
 Miss Sharma, I know that he has never been so far 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.210
 verification. Charming author. His life is 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.210
 Equally as charming as his work makes one of the always 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:50.180
 My favorite thing, I found this year. Just look at his book 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.150
 I absolutely love it. I read his technique. 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.360
 I read people who are I want to be more weird 

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:58.850
 thing. His short story 

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.350
 From his great work, I just think I think 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.200
 I enjoy every time I read the page. The second thing is me. 

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.030
 Really like to discover this year this is 

00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:11.900
 Something I never thought I would say this is Buddhism. 

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:16.220
 This is the right one for everyone. I want a lot of people 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.220
 Can criticize not benefiting from religion 

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.040
 From things, but just I think if you hug 

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.620
 Buddhism as a philosophy has too many things to learn 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.500
 Especially for me. I think with the thoughts around me 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.050
 from. control 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:33.230
 Why do you want to indulge in self-destructive behavior? 

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:36.200
 Something, I really benefited a lot, it's something, I 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:39.080
 Never really been taught, so I am really happy, I read this 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.050
 In this book, I picked it up for a complete victory, the sun came out. 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.540
 There is no way out, I am more and more like a blast of fire. 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:47.420
 Jesus Christ. I find it very interesting because of its many 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:50.450
 Why shouldn't you be addicted to the idea of ​​self-destruction? 

00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:53.420
 Behavior is somewhat related to another book 

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:55.880
 I am reading. I talked about this before 

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:59.180
 Live out the meaning to Victor you Frank who 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:02.110
 It is a survivor of the Holocaust. He survived, I think two or three 

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.790
 Concentration camp and he did 

00:07:04.790 --> 00:07:07.770
 Observing person, you 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.480
 Know to start smoking or do these self-destruction 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:13.100
 Something in the camp avoids people 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.280
 a general abandonment and 

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.440
 These are all people will be shortly after. 

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.810
 Obviously not for everyone, but will go because they 

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.150
 They lost meaning and they lost their grip 

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.530
 I think you can say that you know me here. 

00:07:28.310 --> 00:07:30.350
 The privilege is a little sweet boy. 

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:34.580
 Why should I do these self-destructive things. what is 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:37.400
 I mean I can do this. Frankel said: 

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.220
 Also, you should live for yourself if you already 

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.040
 Let's make your mistake if you already 

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:46.040
 Live it and complete all the errors because this changes 

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.830
 Your attitude towards life is in a meaningful way. and this 

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:51.170
 Connecting a lot of ideas in my opinion 

00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.440
 Reincarnation this sounds weird, I said, but 

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:57.440
 It gives you a positive meaning and prospects 

00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.410
 Life is in my opinion. Whether you hug or not 

00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.870
 Its religious and spiritual aspects 

00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.260
 And whether you believe it or not, 

00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:09.260
 Think it is irrelevant, or at least it is actually 

00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:11.990
 Relevance, but it doesn't really change anything, no 

00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.930
 Change the result. 

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.770
 I think if you have a meaning thing, you can pass you can say 

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.430
 Treating life with any pain in Buddhism 

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.300
 pain. This becomes very weird. 

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:24.610
 It has always been my last point. Life is bad. I want to tell us, 

00:08:24.610 --> 00:08:27.460
 Talking about the dystopian, I can 

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:30.290
 Because I think at this time, many people like to start 

00:08:30.290 --> 00:08:33.050
 read. The earliest one including me 

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:35.510
 The book is a brave new world I have read this year. 

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:38.840
 Written by Huxley. I like this one, especially because 

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.780
 It mixes well with intentional or unintentional comedy 

00:08:41.790 --> 00:08:44.750
 I do not know. How serious is it? 

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.630
 Get it and how dark it is. We really should provide 

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:50.660
 The meaning of influence behind it. I do not want to go too much 

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:53.300
 More regrets. But the main reason I raised this question is 

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.240
 Because many of you recommend 

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:58.940
 This book for me is this Fahrenheit 

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:01.940
 451 This is another ectopic 

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.730
 Depicting the future, people will not read. 

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:07.820
 They have the same idea in general, but I think 

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.460
 These are two good examples, so one is very big. 

00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:13.370
 Elevator sales this one dozen but this time there are so many 

00:09:13.370 --> 00:09:16.220
 The back is more impactful. It just sounds 

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.160
 I like the sloppy anger 

00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:22.160
 Old man. This is a film that will be adapted from the film. 

00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:25.130
 it. I want to sing lily even in it. 

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:26.300
 So this will be great. 

00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.320
 God, which day? 

00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:34.010
 Phoebe and government control information 

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:36.900
 Scripture in today's media information. I 

00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.830
 Said quite consistent. Just go to any social media site 

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:42.720
 On the scene, you will see that there are every story on both sides, every one of you 

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.430
 It really just sounds like a crying person and an idiot, you are. 

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:48.460
 The latest thing is so bad. This book is so scary 

00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.020
 I think this is a book, this is a good example. 

00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.960
 Morality is the core center 

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:57.080
 Novel. just 

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.920
 Make it look like me, beauty is a hype boring you 

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.330
 The novel is when you have those characters 

00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.270
 Interesting story, really fighting 

00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.270
 Your way. The idea behind 

00:10:08.270 --> 00:10:10.820
 It's not as transparent, they have so much 

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:13.370
 In my opinion, it affects. This is so 

00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:16.190
 The sloppy writing is so bad. it 

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:18.950
 Blowing my mind, this is what gets advice. 

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:22.340
 Don't look at this one. There are so many wonderful dystopian works out there. 

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:25.700
 Whenever your goal and the most acclaimed 

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.370
 Book, you see online 

00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.340
 See if there is a lot of popularity, it is a kind of self-help 

00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:34.310
 The book is fine. Obviously, they have a purpose, 

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.010
 There is a lot to learn from as well. But I really 

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.190
 Emphasis is on reading novels and reading novels 

00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:43.280
 There really is no better way to get the meaning behind it. 

00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.130
 Things in my opinion, not just getting it 

00:10:46.130 --> 00:10:48.680
 Spoon to feed you. I also hope that, 

00:10:49.520 --> 00:10:52.310
 More and more people are entering novels and not 

00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:55.190
 Just read non-fiction because I 

00:10:55.190 --> 00:10:58.040
 I know that I have a lot of young players watching me, I know 

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.010
 Young players generally tend to be more inclined to enter 

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:02.840
 Documentary novels are replaced. 

00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:05.170
 However, you have nothing to miss. Are you scared? 

00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.270
 Extremely dark here. Fuck. I think this is me. 

00:11:08.270 --> 00:11:11.090
 I want to say something. I can probably sneak a lot. 

00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.970
 Thank you for listening. I am again with me 

00:11:13.970 --> 00:11:16.710
 I really hope that this kind of incentive is more for you to read as well. 

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:19.670
 Because I have a lot of fun this year, I also 

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:22.490
 It is recommended to start small things. with 

00:11:22.490 --> 00:11:24.770
 It is also possible to set a goal for yourself. I think 

00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.850
 Instead of reading 50 pages, then or 300 

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.530
 Page and stop. It is best to just read 

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:33.420
 Small things like 10 pages a day. That is 

00:11:33.430 --> 00:11:36.200
 If you match it in the flag 

00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:39.110
 At least stop again, I think you will find that you will 

00:11:39.110 --> 00:11:42.050
 Enter it faster than you think. Obviously if you don't 

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:44.810
 Used to read books, I was a one at the time. 

00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.110
 A little hard to enter. 

00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:49.000
 But once you do it great 

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.560
 This is really interesting. If the video gets 

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:54.170
 5000 likes I will give 

00:11:54.170 --> 00:11:56.750
 Take my favorite book of the year 

00:11:57.320 --> 00:12:00.080
 This is the cat in the hat. 

00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:03.100
 Now they are talking. I am thinking about making a whole 

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:05.730
 About the series. its 

00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:06.520
 Damn genius.
