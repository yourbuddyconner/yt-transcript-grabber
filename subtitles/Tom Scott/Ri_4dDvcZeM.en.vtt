00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
 I will leave on vacation this month and at the time of my absence 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.279
 Five content makers on YouTube lined up to make other great videos for you 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:08.520
 We start with science provider (Steve Mold) 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.400
 When he told me the title of this section I thought about my son 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.070
 (I can not) 

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.630
 But I was wrong 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.600
 Cono polite and gentle, you prefer Steve 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.760
 You have a miraculous ability not to learn 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.010
 And that ability is hearing heat 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.949
 The ability to distinguish between hot and cold water using hearing aids 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:31.550
 This we can test 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.679
 I will pour hot water and cold from the same prides 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.409
 In two similar cases 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.240
 And your job is to distinguish between warm and cold 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.940
 And he poured (Agbash) on the screen also 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.059
 Because you differentiate between them with eyesight and this is very easy 

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:47.220
 One way or another 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.440
 let's go 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.640
 The first experiment 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.840
 The second experiment 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.660
 The difference between them was supposed to be easy 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.999
 I do not mind stopping the section and wrote a commentary 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:08.540
 The answer is that the first section was cold water and the second hot 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.280
 Reason why sound difference 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.250
 Water is viscous - or heavy 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.159
 The water viscosity decreases if the temperature increases 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.450
 This is something that is easy to notice in honey 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.229
 Hot honey for his wife is less than cold 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.439
 But with water this is less obvious 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.359
 When the water pours 

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:38.970
 The way water spreads in the cup affects the viscosity 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.650
 The change of spray changes the sound you hear 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:53.259
 Because they are very complicated things 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:02.469
 The interesting thing is you know the difference without thinking about it 

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:08.229
 Your life is full and you hear hot and cold water pouring 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.590
 And like other things you know without thinking about 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.690
 Even if no one said to you 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.050
 Just subscribe to the channel (Steve Mold) 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.460
 And he made this good passage to (Steve)
